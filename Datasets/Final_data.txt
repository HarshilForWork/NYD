BALA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------



Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.



Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
identified with the 24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
letter ta an auspicious letter.

Shlok 1: The ascetic Valmiki inquired Naarada - 'who engaged deeply in austerity and study of Vedas, best among the eloquent and eminent among sages' (as follows:). [1-1-1]

[Commentary] The epic starts with the word auspicious word ta as said in 'takaarovighnanaashakaH', 
	'takaarosaukhyadaayakaH'...

Shlok 2: "Who really is that person in this present world, who is virtuous and vigorous, a conscientious 
	one, one who is mindful of good deeds done to him, and also a speaker of truth and who is determined in his deed... [1-1-2]

Shlok 3: "Who is appropriate in disposition... who is interested in welfare of all beings... who is 
	adept and also an able one... also uniquely pleasant to look at... [1-1-3]

[Commentary] The adeptness of that person is in his knowing all the knowable aspects in this world, and he must be 
able to retain that knowledge to translate into his deeds, not just to sit back with his bookish knowledge, 
but with utmost practicality. His conduct-wise character shall be acceptable i.e., by his lineage he 
shall be noble, by his education he must be well-read, by his actions they must be conducive to norms 
laid down in Veda-s, and thus given any area, he should conduct himself properly. And he must be benign 
not only to higher-ups but to lowly subjects, like Guha, Shabari et al., and he should deal with wrongdoers 
and right-doers conscientiously. Further, he in his mien he shall be pleasant, but not an unsightly 
one. The word eka also means 'unique' and thus his complexion, facial, physical structures 
etc., shall be unique and shall differ from ordinary beings. kShaNe kShaNe yat navataam 
upaiti tadeva ruupam ramaNiiyataayaaH 'which / what / who gets newness moment by moment, that 
alone is pleasant...'

Shlok 4: "Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even
	the gods fear, when provoked to war... [1-1-4]

Shlok 5: "All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, 
and indeed my inquisitiveness is immense..." Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. [1-1-5]

[Commentary] Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki is thinking aloud, about 
the qualities of his prospective hero of this epic and these are the very opening questions put to an Omniscient 
Sage Narada. Both the sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki asks Narada, "who is that 
man with godly qualities?' If Narada tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, there is nothing left for Valmiki 
to compose his epic, because there are numerous mythologies, puraaNa-s, that have already adored God 
Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, again Valmiki need not attempt to author about 
some king, however great that king might be.

[Commentary] The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.1 
- guNavaan 2 - viryavaan 3 - dharmaj~naH 4 - kR^itaj~naH 5 - satyavaakyaH 6 - dhR^iDhavrataH 7 - caaritravaan 8 - sarvabhuuteShu hitaH 9 -
 vidvaan 10 - samarthaH - 11 - priyadarshanaH 12 - aatmavaan 13 - jitakrodhaH 14 - dyutimaan 15 - anasuuyakaH 16 - bibhyatidevaaH These sixteen attributes are attributed 
to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki is about to picture Rama to be as pleasant as a 
full-moon.

Shlok 6: On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said "let 
it be heard..." and beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. 
[1-1-6]

[Commentary] Narada is cognizant of three worlds, where the three worlds are bhuuloka, bhuvarloka, suvarloka 
this world, the intermediary heaven, the heavens themselves.

Shlok 7: "Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard." Thus Narada started to say. [1-1-7]

[Commentary] Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him, and wanted 
him to impart these very attributes to Valmiki to compose Ramayana. It is a coincidence of interests 
Valmiki and those of Narada and Brahma.

Shlok 8: "One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, 
highly valorous, resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. [1-1-8]

[Commentary] For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From niyataatmaa to
vashii these are the attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. swaruupa-niruupaka- 
lakShaNaaH . This niyataatmaa is 'immutable Absolute, this is the postulate of any Upanishad:
ya aatmaa apahatapaapmaa virajo vimR^ityurvishoko... 8-7-1, ChÄndogya-UpaniShad. mahaaviiryaH = acintya
	 vividhavicitrashaktivaan Absolute is Omnicompetent paraa asya shaktiH 
vividhaa iva shruuyate svaabhaavikii j~naanabalakriyaa ca 6-8, Shwetaashvatara-UpaniShad. The 
word dyutimaan is for the attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness.
tam eva bhaantam anubhaati sarvam tasya bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati 2-11, Mundaka-UpaniShad. 
And the dhR^ithimaan is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjayanti dhR^itiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH 
and as said in aanando brahma - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante 6, Taittariiya- 
Upanishad. Next, vashii Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe. eko vahii sarva bhuutaantaraatmaa
     2-5-12, Katha-Upanishad and sarvasya vashii sarvasya iishaanaH and 
the like. The rest of the attributes of Rama as said by Narada are identifiable with the causative factors 
of that Absolute in Creation, and the process of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.

Shlok 9: "He is a wise one, moralist, eloquent, glorious, and a destroyer of enemies. His arms are lengthy, 
with three lines in the neck [indicative of good fortune], and cheekbones high... [1-1-9]

[Commentary] The Absolute is an adept one in creating the Creation yat sarvaj~naH sarvavit. He is niitimaan 
one who maintains the rhythm of universe as said at eSa setuH vidharaNa eSaam lokanaamasambhedaaya... 
He is propitious because shriiH kaantisaMpadoH lakshmyaam... gleaming, glistering richness 
of prosperity emanates from him. The following stanzas describe the physical qualities an Emperor should 
have by birth, as per saamudrikashaastra, the physiognomic treatise of astrology.

Shlok 10: "He is lion-chested, with concealed collarbones, knee-length are his arms, and his is a long bow, an enemy-subjugator, 
and his emperor's countenance is with a crowning-head and an ample forehead, and his gait is majestic like that of a lion... 
[1-1-10]

[Commentary] When his physique is extolled, suddenly a weapon is said, in saying that 'his is longbow...' this is 
called prakramabhangadoSa 'jump-cut in narration...' It is not so, his lengthy arms are said 
firstly and those arms can wield a great bow that can eliminate enemies, both physical and psychological 
ones like ariSaDvarga like desire, ire, avarice, conceit etc., as detailed in verse 
4 above.

Shlok 11: "He is built proportionately physically, with limbs poised symmetrically, sinew-chested, wide-eyed, complexioned 
charmingly... he is a prosperous one with all the auspicious features ... 
[1-1-11]

[Commentary] Up to here the godly physical aspect bhagavadvigraha is explained that which is perceptible 
by the adherents as said in ChÄndogya Upanishad: ya eSo antaraaditye hiraNmayaH puruSo dR^ishyate... 
1-6-6. From now on, the features that are reliable for the adherers are said.

Shlok 12: "He is the knower of rectitude, bidden by the truth, also his concern is in the welfare of subjects, 
proficient in prudence, clean in his conduct, self-controlled and an attentive one... 
[1-1-12]

Shlok 13: "He equals Lord Vishnu, the Lord of all creatures, Sustainer of the Universe, together with Sri Lakshmi (shriimaan = lakShmiivaan), Eliminator of enemies,
 Protector of the world of living creatures and complete Guardian of probity... 
[1-1-13]

[Commentary] The word à¤°à¤à¥à¤·à¤¿à¤¤à¤¾ is the Nominative Singular of à¤°à¤à¥à¤·à¤¿à¤¤à¥ and means Protector. Please note that prajaapatiH can be applied to Vedic Gods as well as to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Maheswara.
Here we consider Rama as equalling the Supreme God Lord Vishnu who is the One with Goddess Sri Lakshmi and also the sustainer. prajaapatiH is thus being translated as Lord Vishnu. Please note that we are
deviating from traditional translations of prajaapatiH as Lord Brahma here and this is intentional.

'These features show the aspects of Rama's incarnation...' Govindaraja. 'These features are available 
only in the Supreme Person, but unobtainable in any other...' Maheshvara Tiirtha. These two, Govindaraja 
and Maheshvara Tiirtha are reputed commentators on Ramayana among many 
others.

Shlok 14: "He is the preserver of his own righteousness and also a champion for adherent's welfare in the same 
righteousness, and he is a scholar in the essence of Veda-s and their ancillaries, too. He is an expert 
in dhanurVeda, the Art of Archery... [1-1-14]

[Commentary] These are the ancillary subjects of Vedas called anga part and upa-anga sub-part. 
The main parts of Veda-s are shikShaa ritual rigor vyaakaraNa grammar chandas 
prosody jyotishya astrology nirukta recital rules kalpa procedure rules. This 
apart, the dhanurveda science of archery, itself is treated as 'an exclusive Veda taught to 
warriors...' The dhanurveda is not to be construed as simple bow and arrow and 'shooting the 
target' education. It is a 'scripture on missiles' that existed in those ages.

[Commentary] Down the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated Weekly 
of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading Ancient India 
may have had N-arms , in the Statesman, with dateline Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, 
the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe the disaster caused by such astra-s, now 
loosely termed as a well crafted bow and sky rocketing arrows, as below:

[Commentary] 'A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire 
was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be 
perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... 
the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with 
clouds...'

[Commentary] Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of Brahmaastra, as in Mahabharata, the other 
Epic of India. Thus the Dhanurveda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, which fortunately 
has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything would have been annihilated 
by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to Mahabharata, there are elaborate accounts of such
astra-s in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, who is well-versed in warfare, gives many 
such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.

Shlok 15: "He is the knower of the meaning and essence of all the scriptures, excellent at memory, a brilliant one, 
and dear to all the worlds, gentle, level-headed and clear-headed in discriminating and distinguishing... 
[1-1-15]

Shlok 16: "Like an ocean that is reached by rivers, that reverential one too is always accessible 
and reachable by clean-minded ones, and he treats all equally, and ever a feast to eye... [1-1-16]

[Commentary] Here it is said 'he is reachable by all clean-minded ones...' satpravartana, sadbudhhi... 
and those that approach him with a sacrilegious intent, will meet their end at his hand. sarvasamaH 
means, that he does not discriminate people by their caste, creed, or by that individual's philosophy 
etc., like tribal boatman Guha, low-birthed Shabari, and nihilist Sage Jaabaali et al. jaati-guNa- 
vR^itti-aadi bhedaabhaavaat And the word eva in sa eva priyadarshanaH indicates 
'always...' 'unvarying in his demeanour with anyone...' Govindaraja. And by the simile of ocean to Rama, 
for rivers there is no other course except an ocean; thus, the living beings, may it be humans or birds 
like Jataayu, have no other recourse than Rama.

Shlok 17: "He who betters the happiness of his mother Kausalya is an embodiment of all noble merits, and in profundity 
he is like an unfathomable ocean, and by fortitude he is unalterable like the kingly Himalayan mountain... 
[1-1-17]

[Commentary] At times Rama is said to be 'the son of Kausalya...' than the son of Dasharatha, because the word Kausalya 
does not signify his mother alone, the daughter of King of Kosala, but it has meanings like kShema, 
kushala, saamarthya, puNya, nipuNatva 'safeness, soundness, capability, merit, expertise...' and 
this also signifies Queen Kausalya's worshipping of Vishnu. When dynasty, valour, braveness etc., are 
said, Rama's name will be attached with Dasharatha. An ocean is not a bottomless one but an unfathomable 
one. So also Rama's heart has a reachable bottom, where pearls, gems, and other treasures of virtues 
are abounding, and it can be reached with a heartily approach. For a hard-hearted one, Rama's heart becomes 
an unfathomable abyss and he will get lost in it. girayoH varShadhaaraabhirharyamaaNaa 
na vivyadhuH | abhibhuuyamaanaa vyasanaiH yathaa adhokShajacetasaa || 'true devotees do not 
get hassled though subjected to many problems, for they place their faith in the Supreme. Equally, mountains 
are unshaken though battered by storms or lightings...' So, like a mountain he is unalterable and constant 
for a true devotee. An icy-mountain is meltable by scorching sun, thus Rama also melts down when his 
adherents are scorched with their problems.

Shlok 18- 19a: "In valour Rama is comparable to Vishnu, and in his looks he is attractive like the moon, he equals 
the earth in his forgiveness, but he is matchable to world ending fire in his wrath... and in benevolence 
he is identical to Kubera, God of Wealth, and in his candour he is like Dharma itself, the 
Truth personified, with none to rival him... [1-1-18, 19a]

[Commentary] Here the 'valour' is to cause harm to enemy, while remaining himself unharmed... svasya avikaara 
eva parasya vikaara aapadanam Rama Tilaka. 'Though Rama is Vishnu, but by nature of his incarnation 
as human, he is different from Vishnu upaadhi-bheda... Hence Vishnu has become another entity 
than Rama... Or, his valour is selfsame to Vishnu's valour because he is selfsame Vishnu...' Govindaraja. 
'As there is none other in similitude, he is compared Vishnu, insofar as valour is concerned...' Maheshvara 
Tiirtha. Earth personally does not grieve when people tread on it, trample, dig, cut, or whatever is 
done to her. Likewise Rama personally gets unaffected, whatever harm is done to him, but he becomes 
wrathful, if that harm is committed to dharma.

[Commentary] Thitherto, the Bala Kanda is narrated by these narrations of sparkled in Ikshvaku dynasty 'Rama's 
incarnation...' highly valorous, enemy subjugator... 'elimination of demoness Tataka, subdual 
of the vanity of Parashu Rama...' propitious 'marriage with Seetha, knows Art of Archery 
'receiving missiles from Vishvamitra...' From now poet tells the Ayodhya Kanda, and a gist of this magnum 
opus is given here itself. This narration is known as baala raamayana - saMkShepa raamaayaNa 
meaning that it is aimed at youngsters as it has been told in an abridged version. In the endnote, details 
about this version and still abridged version, called Gayatri Ramayana, are given.

[Commentary] Readers may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are 'a must.' Pt. 
Satya Vrat, the author of Ramayana - A Linguistic Study says: "Ellipsis is the peculiarity 
of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense 
which has to be supplemented by adhyaahaara, viz., supply of words, that would fit in the 
context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis could be readily understood and would suggest the word 
or words that would make it up...' We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, 
than by the order of words, for there is a saying... paaThakrame arthakramo baliiyaH... So, 
this adhyaahaara, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit 
to English.

Shlok 19b- 20- 21a: "Lord of the land King Dasaratha with an intent for doing good to the people, affectionately desired to endow with regent-hood to that Rama, 
the eldest and a dear son to Dasaratha and who possessed such merits with true valour, together with best of qualities, 
and concerned for welfare of the people....[1-1-29b, 20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: "Then seeing the arrangements for the anointment of Rama as crown-prince, Kaikeyi, the dear wife 
and a queen of Dasaratha, solicited boons that were once accorded to her by Dasharatha, for the 
banishment of Rama and anointment of Bharata as boons. [1-1-21b, 22]

Shlok 23: "Bound by his true plighted word and by the noose of righteousness that king Dasharatha 
		exiled his dear son Rama to forests. [1-1-23]

Shlok 24: "That warrior Rama went to forest for pleasing Kaikeyi, and as 
directed by his father, and to follow his father's word of honour. [1-1-24]

Shlok 25- 26a: "While that Rama was going on exile, Lakshmana, endowed with humbleness, and augmentor of his mother Sumitra's joy, and a loving and a 
dear brother to Rama, followed him out of affection, showing brotherly fraternity.[1-1-25, 26a]

[Commentary] à¤µà¥à¤°à¤à¤¨à¥à¤¤à¤®à¥ is an accusative case of à¤µà¥à¤°à¤à¤¤à¥ with à¤µà¥à¤°à¤à¥ as its root.

Shlok 26b- 27- 28a: "Even Seetha, daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, and Rama's beloved wife equalling to Rama's life, ever well disposed, born in the family of Janaka and one as though 
	fashioned by a Divine marvel, endowed with all good characteristics and the best among women, followed Rama to forest, like Rohini following the Moon... [1-1-26b, 
	27, 28a]

[Commentary] Here devamaayaa refers to many concepts. VaiShNavaite tenets tell that the word
	deva is ascribable only to Vishnu, but not to other gods. Thus, this is ViShNumaayaa,
	 when He assumed an extraordinary female form called Mohini, when distributing
	amR^ita, the divine elixir, to gods and demons. Next is the form of Tilottama, a 
	divine beauty to hoodwink demons called Sunda and Upasunda. The other is Vishnu's liilaa 
	shakti, which is divinely fascinating. Yet another is grammatical connotation, maa 
	yaa where, maa= Goddess Lakshmi; yaa= who that is; meaning yaa 
	siitaa saa maa= 'who is Goddess Lakshmi... She is Seetha...' and this results in the 
	saying: ati ruupavatii siitaa... ati muurkhaH cha raavaNa 'While Seetha is extraordinarily 
	beautiful, Ravana is exceedingly stupid...

[Commentary] The deities have their wives always with them. Chandra, the Moon has Rohini, a conspicuous star, while 
Surya, Sun has Prabha, Sunshine. Minus these wives, their glow and glitter is void. So also, Rama has 
an inseparable wife. Though Seetha and Lakshmana were not exiled, they followed Rama out of concept 
of 'togetherness...'

Shlok 28b- 29- 30a: "The citizens of Ayodhya and his father Dasaratha followed virtuous Rama for a 
distance when he started on his exile. Later Rama reached the tribal chief named Guha, who liked 
Rama, on the bank of River Ganga in a town called Sringaberapura. Together with Guha, 
Lakshmana and Seetha, he left off the charioteer. [1-1-28b, 29, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31- 32a: "That trio of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana after going from forest to forest and crossing many a river with much waters, 
by the ordainment of Bharadwaja, arrived at Chitrakuta, and building a handsome cottage there, they lived happily and delightfully 
in the woods there, like gods and gandharvas... [1-1-30b, 31, 32a]

[Commentary] In another way the meaning is: te avane 'they, protecting each other...' te ramamaaNaaH 
' those two Rama and Seetha, frolicsomely delighted, enjoyed the essence of forest dwelling...' saMkaashaa 
similar to Vishnu or Narayana's enjoyment of kriiDaa rasa 'the essence of His playful acts...' 
and Lakshmana enjoyed the essence of his servitude sevaa rasa and where deva = devii ca 
devaH ca devau 'either goddess or god... it but the Almighty...' gandharva = gaanam dhaarayati 
iti gandharva - jiivan muktaH attaining liberation while living, thus Lakshmana rejoiced with his singing of saama 
gaana of Sama Veda....' And they rejoiced without feeling any difference between city dwelling 
and forest dwelling... as every part of Universe is theirs.

[Commentary] In another way tevane vanam gatvaa 'playfully, to forests, they went...' It is a play for them 
to enter the forest to resolve the purpose of Ramayana and their incarnations.

Shlok 32b- 33a: "On Rama going to Chitrakuta thus, King Dasharatha tormented by the grief for son, went to heavens 
weeping for son... [1-1-32b, 33a]

[Commentary] The word 'thus' in the shloka, is according to the text of Govindaraja. Maheshvara Tiirtha's text will have 'then'.

Shlok 33b- 34: "On Dasharatha's dying, though Bharata had been appointed for kingship by Sage Vashishta and other Brahmanas, that highly mighty one did not desire kingdom.
	That warrior Bharata went to forest to propitiate the venerable Rama... [1-1-33b. 34]

Shlok 35- 36a: "That Bharata, possessed of a worthy way of thinking [to get Rama installed as king], on going to Rama, begged his brother Rama, a great souled one and a 
	truly courageous one. Bharata spoke words in this manner to Rama - "You alone, the knower of probity, be the king." ... ' [1-1-35, 36a]

[Commentary] tu is omitted in the translation since it is there for the purpose of paadapuuraNa.

Shlok 36b- 37a: "Even though Rama was very benevolent, gracious also, highly famed and with great prowess, Rama did not desire kingdom due to father's injunction... [1-1-36b, 37a]

Shlok 37b- 38a: "Thereafter, repeatedly turning Bharata back, the elder brother, Rama, gave his wooden shoes to Bharata and entrusting them to represent him 
for the sake of kingdom. [1-1-37b, 38a]

Shlok 38b- 39a: "That Bharata, thus with a desire unfulfilled, ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, touching Rama's sandals representing feet of Rama, with an
expectation of Rama's arrival... [1-1-38b, 39a]

Shlok 39b- 40: "On the departure of Bharata, that splendid Rama, truth-bound, and self-controlled, anticipated the repeated 
visits of citizens and other people. To be undisturbed, Rama then entered Dandaka forests... [1-1-39b, 40]

[Commentary] The translation of ekaagraH as "undisturbed" is done according to the context of Rama's anticipation that there might be repeated visits
from various people to Chitrakuta and entreaties from them for Rama to return to Ayodhya. Normally ekaagraH is translated as 
"single-pointed attention". Govindaraja explains ekaagraH with respect to following father's injunction or being alert to increased 
presence of RakShasaas.

Shlok 41- 42a: "That lotus-eyed Rama, on his entering the vast Dandaka forest, killed the demon Viraadha, and 
indeed beheld Sage Sharabhanga and also Sage Suteekhsna, Sage Agastya and likewise Sage Agastya's 
brother... [1-1-41, 42a]

[Commentary] The name of Agastya's brother is Sudarshana, and he will never be called by his own name, but will be 
called as agatsyabhraataa, brother of Agastya.

[Commentary] tu is omitted in the translation since it is there for the purpose of paadapuuraNa.

Shlok 42b- 43a: "On Sage Agastya's word, Rama, with great delight, received from Agastya, Indra's bow along with the sword and two quivers with ever replenishing
 arrows... [1-1-42b, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: "During Rama's stay in the forest, all the sages together with other forest dwellers,
approached him for the elimination of ogres and demons... [1-1-43b, 44a]

Shlok 44b- 45: "He [Rama] agreed to that supplication of those sages dwelling in the forest of demons. A promise was also made by Rama to the sages who equalled 
the fire and who were living in that Dandaka forest about killing of the demons in combat... [1-1-44b, 45]

[Commentary] The word asura is as from asuun raati iti asura: asu = life; ra= taker; i.e., 
life takers - demons, while the word sura is nectar consuming one, the divine. In later chapters 
of this canto, accounts are given as how these were created and named.

Shlok 46: "While Rama was living there in the Dandaka forest, a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpa-nakha, who was 
a resident of Janasthana, a portion of Dandaka forest, was disfigured by him... [1-1-46]

[Commentary] Readers are referred to the verse 3-18-20 where Rama asks 
Lakshmana to deface Shuurpa-nakha who carries out the act of cutting the 
nose and ears of this demoness, which is the turning point of the story. From this verse it is clear that Rama is instrumental in the disfiguring
of Shuurpa-nakha.

[Commentary] Shuurpa-nakha is so named because her fingernails are like winnowing fans, shuurpatulyanakhaa iti shuurpanakhaa; shuurpa= 
	winnowing fan; tulya = like; nakhaa = fingernails. She is the sister of Ravana the main antogonist of the epic, and 
	she is the actual trouble creator in the epic.

Shlok 47- 48a: "Then in a battle, Rama killed all demons who became zealously active incited by Suurphanakha's words, 
including the demons Khara, Trishira, Duushana together with all of their foot-followers... [1-1-47, 48a]

[Commentary] We are ignoring in translation the à¤à¤µ part of à¤à¥à¤µ and translating the word à¤à¥à¤µ as "and".

Shlok 48b- 49a: "During Rama's stay in that forest, fourteen thousand demon inhabitants of Janasthana became slain... [1-1-48b, 49a]

Shlok 49b- 50a: "Then, on hearing the slaughter of his kinsmen, Ravana convulsed in anger and sought to get the help of a 
		demon named Maareecha... [1-1-49b, 50a]

[Commentary] Ravana is the supremo of demons and the main antagonist in this epic. His name is Dashagriiva, meaning 
that he has ten heads. This name 'Ravana' obtains from the root ru - shabde raavayati iti raavaNaH 'one who makes 
people cry by his violent actions...' and it also means vishravasaH apatyam pumaan raavaNaH, 
vishravaso vishravaNa-ravaNau 'the son of one named Vishravasa...' Govindaraja.

Shlok 50b- 51a: "But Maareecha restrained Ravana telling him many times, 'Oh, Ravana! Rivarly with that formidable 
Rama is not appropriate of you...' [1-1-50b, 51a]

Shlok 51b- 52a: "Then disregarding Maareecha's words and impelled by his own fate, Ravana advanced to the 
place of Rama's hermitage along with Maareecha... [1-1-51b, 52a]

Shlok 52b- 53a: "After taking away of Rama and Lakshmana to a distance by the trickster Maareecha, Ravana stole Rama's wife after killing Jatayu... [1-1-52b, 53a]

Shlok 53b- 54a: "Raghava on seeing the smitten Jatayu and also on hearing about Seetha's abduction, wailed with disturbed senses, 
seething with anguish  ... [1-1-53b, 54a]

Shlok 54b- 55: "Rama then cremated that vulture Jataayu with that state of anguish, and while searching for Seetha in forest, he 
indeed saw a demon named Kabandha, deformed in his looks and with a terrible appearance... [1-1-54b, 
55]

Shlok 56- 57a: "That Rama with great arms after slaying Kabandha, cremated him and Kabandha obtanined heaven. Before going to heaven, he spoke thus to Rama:
'Oh Raghava! You proceed to Sabari, a lady with righteous conduct, an expert in probity and a devotee.'... [1-1-56, 57a]

Shlok 57b- 58a: "That great resplendent Rama, the son of Dasaratha, an anhillator of enemies, approached Sabari and was thoroughly honoured by her... [1-1-57b, 58a]

[Commentary] Next verse onwards the episodes in KiShkindha are introduced. Now Rama meets Hanuma, the Vaanara.  vanena= in forests, charati= moves about,
iti= thus; therefore vaanara = 'forest-ranger' is the declination of the term Vaanara.  
Traditionally Hanuma is worshipped as a god.

Shlok 58b- 59a: "Rama was united indeed with the Vanara Hanuma on the banks of Lake Pampa, and upon the word of Hanuma, Rama met with 
	Sugreeva... [1-1-58b, 59b]

Shlok 59b- 60a: "The highly powerful Rama detailed from the beginning all that happened, and in particular the abduction of Seetha, to Sugriva 
and to Hanuma also... [1-1-59b, 60a]

[Commentary] Here the use of 'highly powerful...' for Rama is to indicate that though he himself was capable enough 
to eliminate Ravana, but as a human, he needed some agency, since humans in such difficulties 
are usually in need of a helping hand. As such, Rama had to befriend Sugreeva and 
it was necessary to narrate all sad episodes to his friend.

Shlok 60b- 61a: "The Vanara Sugreeva after listening to all that talk of Rama made friendship with Rama delightedly with sacred fire as witness... [1-1-60b, 61a]

Shlok 61b- 62a: "Then out of affection, the incident was related with regard to Sugreeva's enemity with Vali  
in its entirety by the Vanara King with grief to Rama ... [1-1-61b, 62a]

Shlok 62b- 63a: "Then a solemn promise was made by Rama with regards to killing of Vali. In that regard Vanara Sugreeva also described Vali's strength... [1-1-62b, 63a]

[Commentary] Vali, the elder brother of Sugreeva, is another principle character of Ramayana. He is capable of rendering 
oblations to gods in the wee hours of a single day in four oceans on four sides of the globe, by his 
flying from one ocean to the other. He is mightier than Ravana, the chief villain of the epic, and 
Ravana was subdued by Vali's strength. As a preamble to the incident of eliminating mighty Ravana in 
the last book of the epic, this episode of eliminating a still mightier monkey is the stepping-stone 
for the climactic victory.

Shlok 63b- 64: "But Sugreeva remained ever doubtful with respect to Raghava, about Raghava's prowess. Sugreeva showed Dundubhi's big and great mountain-like
dead body to gain confidence in Raghava... [1-1-63b, 64]

[Commentary] Vali had at one time killed Dundubhi and kicked his body over a long distance.

Shlok 65: Great armed and very powerful Rama after seeing the bones of Dundubhi smiled and by the big toe of his foot threw it wholly for ten 
yojana-s length. [1-1-65]

[Commentary] Vali was able to throw that body, with whole of his foot, only up to two hundred bow-lengths, where the 
length of bow is said as six to seven feet. But Rama could kick that heap to ten yojana lengths, roughly 
ninety miles, only with a flip of his foot-toe's tip. But Sugreeva continued his grumbling, 'in those 
days this skeleton was with flesh and blood, now it became weight-less, thus show me more of your show 
of strength...' One Yojana is an ancient measure for distance, where that distance is covered in one 
yoking. Chambers dictionary puts it as five miles, and it is not agreeable for it was British-Indian revenue 
measure. Traditionally it is four krosha-s and thus each yojana is nine to ten miles.

[Commentary] Govindaraja cleaves the compound utsmayitvaa to ut smayitvaa and takes ut 
'to up...' and fixes it to cikShepa to mean ut cikShepa 'up-heaved and hurled...' 
and smayitva comes to mean 'smiling self-assuredly, or smiling self-composedly...' And Maheshvara 
Tiirtha says that 'when all-wise-knowers are not able to know what I am, there is no surprise if a monkey 
in a remote forest doubts my capability... let him see a speck of it...' thus Rama smiled in aplomb...'

[Commentary] And the often repeated epithet to Rama mahaabaahuH means not just 'yards and yards of lengthy 
arms...dangling up to knees..' but 'one who does unimaginable deeds...' and his arms are the unusual 
instruments to perform such unusual tasks, hence ambidextrous, or omni-dextrous...

Shlok 66: "Then again Rama ripped through seven massive Sala trees with only one great arrow, which not only went through 
the trees but also rent through a mountain, and to the nethermost subterranean of earth, in order to 
create faith in the mind of Sugreeva... [1-1-66]

[Commentary] The rasaatala is deepest subterranean plane, and it forms the base of other planes of earth 
called, atala, vitala, sutala, talaatala, mahaatala, rasaatala underneath the surface of earth 
up to its core.

Shlok 67: "Thereafter great monkey Sugreeva with a gladdened heart by that act of Rama, proceeded to cave-like Kishkindha then along with Rama 
and with confidence in Rama's strength... 
[1-1-67]

Shlok 68: "Then that best monkey Sugreeva, with a golden hue, made a roaring sound. By that loud sound, the king of monkeys, Vali, emerged out... 
[1-1-68]

Shlok 69: "Then after Tara [wife of Vali] permitting, Vali met with Sugreeva in a combat. And Rama killed this Vali with a single arrow there... [1-1-69]

Shlok 70: "Then Raghava after killing Vali in a combat as per Sugreeva's plea, installed Sugreeva alone as the king of Vanaras.. [1-1-70]

Shlok 71: "That best among monkeys, Sugreeva, after summoning all Vanaras, dispatched them in different directions to behold the daughter of Janaka... [1-1-71]

[Commentary] Sugreeva was acclaimed to be a strict disciplinarian, and his orders were inviolable by anyone. Even now the 
proverbial saying exists that a "command by elders is to be followed like sugreevaaj~naa 'Sugreeva's 
order'.

Shlok 72: "After that, the strong Hanuma, upon the word of the vulture Sampati who was elder brother of Jatayu, flew across the salty ocean
 one hundred yojanas in breadth... [1-1-72]

Shlok 73: "On reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, Hanuma saw Seetha situated in Ashoka gardens there and meditating on Rama alone... [1-1-73]

Shlok 74: "After delivering to Seetha the mark of identification in the form of a ring from Rama and also communicating
 Rama's disposition and consoling Vaidehi, Hanuma destroyed the welcome-arch of Ashoka gardens... [1-1-74]

Shlok 75: "After killing five army chiefs and seven minister's sons and crushing the valiant Aksha, Hanuma got into state of captivity... [1-1-75]

Shlok 76-77: "Knowing himself to be free from the captivity of the weapon according to Brahma's boon, the valiant great monkey Hanuma
enduring those demons with self-will who tied his tail with ropes with the intention of burning it, there after burning the city of Lanka while 
 leaving from fire the Seetha of Mithila, got back again to convey the pleasant news to Rama ... [1-1-76, 77]

[Commentary] This is in sundara kaanDa. Hanuma sees Ravana and others in the court, and as a show 
of his strength burns down Lanka  except the place where Seetha is stationed, only to prove that the riches and wealth enjoyed at the cost others will burn 
down to ashes some day, 
besides Vibheeshana's place, for Vibheeshana is the adherer of Dharma. This episode is to relegate 
the false pride of Ravana, and as a symbolic suggestion that pomp and effluence without virtue are short 
lived.

Shlok 78: "Approaching the great Rama and peforming circumambulation around Rama, Hanuma having an inestimable intelligence,
submitted in essence thus: 'Seen Seetha...' [1-1-78]

Shlok 79: "There-after, Rama along with Sugreeva and other monkeys went to the shore of Great Ocean, and put the Ocean-god to turmoil with his arrows 
comparable to the Sun... [1-1-79]

[Commentary] Rama became angry at the ocean for not yielding way to Lanka. In order to make way through the Ocean, 
Rama starts depleting its waters with arrows.

Shlok 80: "The Ocean-god revealed himself and upon his word, Nala built the bridge across the ocean... [1-1-80]

[Commentary] Nala, a Vanara engineer, had a boon from his mother. In his childhood he used to throw playthings into 
water wanting them to float. But they were all submerged. His mother then gave a boon to him saying 
that whatever article he throws in waters will float, may they be toys or stones or boulders. Here 
that boon is taken advantage of, and a boulder bridge is built on ocean waters.

Shlok 81: "Rama, having gone to the city of Lanka by that bridge, killing Ravana in a battle, experienced great shame on getting Seetha back... [1-1-81]

Shlok 82: "There-after, Rama spoke harshly to Seetha in the assembly of the people. Being devoted to her husband, that Seetha, intolerant of the
 harsh words of Rama, entered into burning fire... [1-1-82]

Shlok 83: "Then, upon the word of Fire-god, having known Seetha to be sinless, Rama became extremely glad.
Worshipped by all gods he became resplendent. By that accomplishment of the great Raghava the three worlds together with mobile and immobile
beings, and with groups of gods and sages became exultant... [1-1-83, 84]

Shlok 85: "Enthroning Vibheeshana as the chieftain of demons in Lanka, and with a done deed, 
Rama then rejoiced highly indeed free from distress... [1-1-85]

Shlok 86: "After obtaining a boon from the gods, Rama  raised up monkeys from death. He then travelled to Ayodhya by Pushpaka aircraft
surrounded by good hearted ones... 
[1-1-86]

Shlok 87: "Rama, with true valour, on going to sage Bharadwaja's hermitage, sent Hanuma to the presence of Bharata... [1-1-87]

Shlok 88: "Then, having boarded Pushpaka aircraft again after leaving the hermitage of Bharadwaja, and narrating past history
 to Sugreeva and others about the events in the days of his exile in forests, while flying overhead 
of the very same places, Rama went to Nandigrama... [1-1-88]

Shlok 89: "That sinless Rama rejoining with all of his brothers in the village Nandigrama removed his matted hair. 
Thus he, on regaining Seetha and on discarding hermit's role again became 
a householder, and he regained his kingdom also... [1-1-89]

Shlok 90: "When Rama is ruling the world will be highly rejoiced and happy, satisfied and abundant, 
also very righteous, wholesome, disease-free, and free from fear of famine..." Thus Narada is 
foreseeing the future and telling Valmiki. [1-1-90]

Shlok 91: "While Rama is on the throne men will not see the deaths of their children anywhere in their lifetime, 
and the ladies will remain husband-devouted and unwidowed during their lifetime... [1-1-91]

Shlok 92- 93a: "In the kingdom of Rama, there will be no fear for his subjects from wildfires, gale-storms or from diseases, 
and there will be no fear from hunger or thieves, nor the cattle will be drowned in floodwaters as well... [1-1-92, 
93a]

Shlok 93b- 94a: "Cities and states as well will be replete with wealth and grains likewise. All his subjects will be highly glad always,
like in Krita yuga... [1-1-93b, 94a]

Shlok 94b- 95a: "Like-wise the highly illustrious Rama having performed hundreds of horse rituals and having donated plentiful gold and crores
of cows and wealth that cannot be counted to Brahmanas and to scholars according to custom... [1-1-94b, 95a]

Shlok 96: "In this world Raghava will establish kingly dynasties in hundredfold and he will be maintaining the 
four-caste system positing each in his own duty, may it be caste-bound or provincial-kingdom-bound 
duty, in order to achieve a perfect social harmony... [1-1-96]

Shlok 97: "Having served the kingdom for ten thousand years and another one thousand years, i.e. for a total 
of eleven thousand years, Rama will go to the abode of Brahma... [1-1-97]

[Commentary] In raamaraajyam upaasitvaa... the word used is upaasana is not ruling by sceptre but 
it is 'reverentially serving the kingdom...' as one would regard or treat his personal god with reverence. 
Rama thus served his kingdom as a devotee of his subjects and this is the concept of raamaraajya. 
The brahma loka is not the abode of four-faced Brahma, but still higher abode, rather VaikunTha itself.

Shlok 98: "This Ramayana is holy, sin-eradicating, merit-endowing, and conformable with the teachings of Vedas.
Whoever reads this Legend of Rama, will be verily liberated of all sins... [1-1-98]

Shlok 99: "This Ramayana is long-life giving. A narrative by reading which a human will be blessed with sons and grandsons, and after enjoying worldly
comforts with attendants, will be adored in heaven after demise... 
[1-1-99]

Shlok 100: "By reading this Ramayana, that person if a Brahmana obtains excellency in speech, if a Kshatriya obtains land-lordship, if Vaisya
attains profit in trade and even if a Sudra attains excellence." Thus Sage Narada gave a gist of Ramayana 
to Sage-poet Valmiki. [1-1-100]



In the first chapter of Bala Kanda the gist of Ramayana is imbibed and it is called saMkShepa raamaayaNa, 
or also called baala raamaayaNa . The youngsters are asked to recite these stanzas daily for 
longevity and a perfect personality like that of Rama. The summarised stanzas reflected here are from 
the main epic. The canto-wise summarisation is as below:



Valmiki composed Ramayana according to the letters of Gayatri Hymn and they are identified with the 
following verses in all cantos:



SARGA 2
------------------------------



Sage Valmiki goes to river Tamasa for a bath and sees a couple of birds, of which a hunter 
kills one. Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, 
of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, 
the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic 
of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him.

Shlok 1: Then, the great sage Valmiki, a skilled orator and a virtue-minded one, having heard those words of Narada, 
		worshipped him along with disciples. [1-2-1]

Shlok 2: That divine sage Narada being worshipped befittingly by Valmiki in that way, on seeking 
permission of Valmiki to leave and having been permitted by Valmiki, went away heaven-ward. 
[1-2-2]

Shlok 3: Then, on Narada's going to the world of gods in a trice, that sage Valmiki went to the banks of Tamasa river not far from Jahnavi river. [1-2-3]

Shlok 4: Then that sage Valmiki on reaching the shore of the clean Tamasa, and on beholding a ford of that river, spoke to his disciple who was at his side. [1-2-4]

Shlok 5: "Oh! Bharadwaja, behold this ford which is without dirt, with clear waters and pleasant like a virtuous man's mind. [1-2-5]

Shlok 6: "My dear! Let the hand-vessel [kamaNDalu] be kept [there]. Let my bark-garment be given to me. I will enter this best 
ford of Tamasa only... [1-2-6]

Shlok 7: Thus being said by the great-souled Valmiki, Bharadwaaja who was obedient to his Guru, gave the bark-garment to the sage [1-2-7]

Shlok 8: That self-controlled Sage Valmiki on taking bark-garment from his disciple's hands, and looking in all directions, indeed moved away from that
wide expanse of forest. [1-2-8]

Shlok 9: There holy sage Valmiki saw a couple of curlews, in the vicinity of that river's 
foreshore, flying there about in togetherness and cooing charmingly. [1-2-9]

Shlok 10: A tribal hunter with evil intent, and a receptacle of enimity, killed the male 
one among the couple of birds, while Valmiki was looking on. [1-2-10]

Shlok 11-12: The wife was moving together with husband with a red crest and with joy, with good wings, always being united with that male bird. On seeing
that bird slain on ground reeling with blood covered wings really made wailing sounds with piteous utterances on being separated from her 
husband. 
[1-2-11, 12]

Shlok 13: On seeing that bird felled that way by the tribal hunter, compassion occassioned in that 
saintly sage Valmiki. [1-2-13]

Shlok 14: Then on seeing the wailing female krounchi bird, out of state of compassion and apperceiving 
the killing of male bird as unjust, the sage uttered this sentence... [1-2-14]

Shlok 15: "Oh! violent Hunter, by which reason you have killed one bird of the couple, when it 
was infatuated by passion, for that reason you will never get a state of rest for everlasting years to come..." 
[1-2-15]

[Commentary] à¤¤à¥à¤µà¤®à¤à¤®à¤ has been split as tvam+agamaH.

[Commentary] 'For endless years to come, O Hunter, never 
shall thy soul find peace /' Romesh C. Dutt.

[Commentary] This verse has many comports of which a few are given hereunder:

[Commentary] This verse is taken as ma~NgalaacaraNa to Ramayana, 
for any epic has to have ma~Ngalaaadiini; ma~Ngalamadhyaani; ma~Ngalaantaani   
A good pious beginning, pious middle and pious ending.

[Commentary] Because this verse has the letter
maa at its start and maa is lakShmii vaacaka 
in Sanskrit. It is aadivarNaH The first letter  lokamaataa maa 
ramaa ma~Ngaladevataa thus amarakosha says for Goddess Lakshmi.

[Commentary] maa= Goddess Lakshmi; niShaada= Oh! Vishnu [ for Goddess 
Lakshmi resides in the heart of Vishnu - niShadiiti asmin iti niShaada
]; yat = by which act; krouncamithunaat = the couple of 
demons, namely Ravana and Mandodari; kaamamohitam= that impassioned one and stole 
Seetha; ekam= that one, Ravana; avadhiiH= you killed; by that act of yours; 
shaashvatiissamaa= everlasting for ages; pratiShTaam= divine sanctity; 
tvam agamaH= you, get.

[Commentary] "Oh, the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, namely oh, Vishnu, by which act of your killing one male demon named 
Ravana, who in his passion abducted Seetha, and thus you eradicated the vice from the earth, 
for that you get an everlasting divine sanctity, as Rama, for ages to come."

[Commentary] 2] Next niSaada is attributable to Ravana, because he is the one who tortures others for 
his benefit. itaraam saadayati piiDayati iti niSaada thus: Oh! Ravana; krounchamithunaat= from the couple, 
say Rama and Seetha, who are flying from forest to forest like nest-less birds; 
ekam= one is, Seetha is; avadhiiH =you almost killed her by your torture of abducting 
her;
pratiSTaam= your glory in Lanka, at its zenith, as per the kindness of Brahma; maa agamaH= 
never get, hereafter. But this declination is not held right, for it is like a curse, shaapa, 
and no epic starts with a curse.

[Commentary] 3] Next, this verse is said holding Rama in the perspective. Sage Narada gave the details of the 
legend to Sage Valmiki because Brahma ordered that the legend of Rama is to be recorded. But 
Ramayana is full of pathos, karuNa-shoka-rasa-pradhaana. If it is to be penned the writer 
too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks, Rama, say 
Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like kiraataarjuniiya 
etc., to test the capability of Valmiki in narrating pathos, and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted 
immediately and Vishnu's test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Vishnu / Rama 
gets a curse like separation from wife, as below.

[Commentary] niShaada= oh tribal: Rama to Valmiki / Vishnu to mythology; for your killing one bird of 
the couple, to the misery of the female one; shaashvatiiH = as long as you live on this 
earth;
samaaH pratiSTaam= togetherness, with your wife; maa agama= do not get.

[Commentary] Oh! Rama, as long as you are on earth, you do not get the love of being together with your wife, 
because you killed one from the bird couple... and you have to live with your wife departed [to 
Lanka,] come again, and then departed [to forests.]

[Commentary] But this is differed statement, since Vishnu does not require any personal testing of the 
capabilities of the writer of Ramayana. Brahma will look after such literary things.

[Commentary] 4] The generally accepted meaning of this verse is this. Any epic's gist is to be said at the start 
or, at its commencement 
--- kaavyaarthasuucanam  
aadaaveva niruupyate--- 
 Thus, the above verse included the meaning of whole of the epic, 
Ramayana.

[Commentary] i] maa niSaada= Goddess Lakshmi and Vishnu. Their marriage in their incarnations as Rama 
and Seetha, and Ramayana depicts this in Bala Kanda.

[Commentary] ii] pratiSTaam tvam agamaH= renown, you get, by following your father's orders you have 
repaired to forests, without any political upheaval, thus get an everlasting renown as an obliging 
son Ayodhyaa Kanda.

[Commentary] iii] shaashavatiissamaa= by dwelling in forest and eradicating demons and helping the saints 
and sages thus, you achieve an everlasting praise Aranaya Kanda.

[Commentary] iv] krounchayoH= from the [atrocious] couple;
k-- krunca 
gati kauTilya alpiibhaavayoH; the 
atrocious Vali, and Tara couple; ekam kaamamohitam = passion filled one, i.e., Vali; 
avadhiiH= you killed, you killed Vali KiShkindhaa Kanda.

[Commentary] v] krounchamithunaat= from the couple of lovely passionate birds here Rama and Seetha; 
niSaada that ruffian Ravana, kaamamohitam lustfully, ekam one [i.e., 
Seetha];
avadhiiH = almost killed, i.e., her residing in Lanka is as good as death Sundara Kanda.

[Commentary] vi] krounchamithunaat = from the atrocious, couple Ravana and Mandodari; ekam avadhiiH
you killed one [Ravana] Yuddha Kanda.

[Commentary] vii] kaamamohitam= fascinated by desire, [ kaama also means a longing, desire, let 
alone lusting]; Seetha is fascinated by her desire to see sage's wives in uttara Ramayana and thus 
she is sent to forests through Lakshmana. Hence seventh canto, uttara Ramayana is also 
suggested.

Shlok 16: Thus speaking and pondering in his heart, he became thoughtful: "What is this utterance by me in grief and anguish for this bird?". [1-2-16]

Shlok 17: That great wise one who was an intellectual and the best among sages, on cogitating, made up his mind and also spoke these words to the 
disciple... [1-2-17]

Shlok 18: "While I was tormented by grief, there arose a sentence consisting of four verses possessing metrically posited letters
suitable to be played as song and string music and that will be called Shloka, not otherwise..." [1-2-18]

[Commentary] This verse he uttered is in four quarters, each quarter with equally posited eight syllables. This 
is called anuSTup metre in Sanskrit poetry. The eight syllables are,
-- maa ni  Shaa da  pra  ti  ShTaa~N  tvam | a  ga maH  shaa  shva  tiiH  sa  maaH  
--  Each quarter is paada in Sanskrit, pede in Latin; with two 
quarters in first stanza, and two stanzas one verse. This apart there are other rules like caesura 
yati
; alliteration praasa ; and other compositional rules. It has come out of shoka
sorrow, so the format is named as shloka. And, shloka also means yashas, 
kiirti
renown.

Shlok 19: Even the disciple happily received what that is articulated by the saint, a unique articulation, 
by which the saint too, was delighted. [1-2-19]

Shlok 20: Then that saint on performing his bathing in that ford according to custom, and still thinking 
on the purport of his utterance, he returned towards his hermitage. [1-2-20]

[Commentary] This is mid day bath for these hermits. tato 
madhyaahnasnaanaartham mR^idam aaharet | - - prekShya sa omkaaram aadityam triH nimajje jalaashaye 
- - vyaasa smR^iti  The word abhiSheka refers to 
ceremonial showering of waters on deities or on kings in his coronation. At the beginning Valmiki 
arrives at the river for a daily bath, which he would do by usual dipping in river waters. But here 
it appears that waters are showered on him, abhiShekam kR^itvaa meaning that waters showered 
on him are on the analogy of poetic verses of Ramayana.

Shlok 21: Then Bharadwaja, the obedient disciple and an erudite scholar, for he heard and learnt many 
scriptures by listening, on taking handy-vessel full with water followed at the behind of 
his mentor. [1-2-21]

Shlok 22: He that knower of dharma, Valmiki, having entered the threshold of hermitage along with disciples, 
and having seated spoke about the day-to-day teachings and also other things, but he himself 
is preoccupied in cogitation on the verse. [1-2-22]

Shlok 23: Then, the great resplendent Four-faced creator of fourteen worlds, almighty Brahma, arrived 
there on his own, to see that eminent saint Valmiki. [1-2-23]

[Commentary] Comment; The deities do not usually arrive on their own, but reveal themselves after a great 
penance, or on raising hue and cry as is done by demon devotees. Here Brahma, one among the 
Trinity of Hindu mythology, arrives on his own, to execute a divine deed through Valmiki, 
i.e. authoring the epic, Ramayana.

Shlok 24: Then that pious saint Valmiki is highly surprised on seeing Brahma, and on quickly getting 
up from his seat with his palms adjoined humbly, he stood aside, as he is spellbind. [1-2-24]

Shlok 25: Valmiki uninterruptedly venerated Brahma, on inquiring into his well-being, washed his feet, drenched his 
thirst, seated him to rest, and adored at best with customarily obeisance. [1-2-25]

[Commentary] Comment: Brahma is one in the Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Brahma is pictured to 
have four faces, each representing one Veda, where Vedas are four in number. He is the creator 
of worlds, while Vishnu maintains them, and Shiva dissolute them. The concert of Brahma is 
Saraswati, the presiding deity of speech, who was earlier requested by Brahma to be on the 
tongue of Valmiki to utter the poem, [as at 1-2-15] as an intuition to Valmiki. Thus Brahma 
now arrives to ordain Valmiki to author Ramayana.

Shlok 26: Then god Brahma, who is seated on a high seat, very highly worshipped by Valmiki, also beckoned 
at Valmiki to take a seat. [1-2-26]

Shlok 27-28a: Even though Valmiki sat on his seat when duly permitted by Brahma, and though the Grandparent 
of the worlds is manifestly sitting before him, but the same broodings on those happenings 
occurred on that day have recurred on his mind. [1-2-27-28a]

Shlok 28b-29a: "He that tribal hunter, who killed a cutely calling krouncha bird for no good reason than intending 
to capture the kill, is an evil souled one that caused hardship..." [1-2-28b-29a]

Shlok 29b-30a: Remaining in melancholic mood Valmiki turned his mind to the depth of thinking, and again 
thinking only on the krouncha bird he sung the same verse, involuntarily. [1-2-29b-30a]

[Commentary] The word jaguH is singing; gai= shabde; liT; prathama bahu; jagau - jagatuH - jaguH; 
variant of gaay; c.f. Raghuvamsha of Kalidasa, verse 20, in fourth sarga; 
aakumaarakathodghaatam shaaligopyo
jaguryashaH

Shlok 30b-31a: Then, Brahma smilingly spoke to that eminent saint Valmiki, "But, what that is composed is 
a verse only... and there is no need to think through... [1-2-30]

Shlok 31b-32a: "Oh, Brahman, that speech of yours sprang forth at my wish alone, hence oh, eminent sage, 
you shall render the legend of Rama, in its entirety... [1-2-31]

Shlok 32b-33a: "You shall narrate the legend of Rama, the virtuous, intellectual and an intrepid one, and 
a godlike person in this world as well, as you have heard it from sage Narada. [1-2-32]

Shlok 33b-35a: "The adventures of valorous Rama along with Lakshmana, and the misadventures of demons, known 
or unknown in every detail, and even the plight of Vaidehi which is either revealed or un-revealed 
so far, and whatever legend that has happened, all that will also be known to you, even if 
it were to be unknown, as yet... [1-2-33-34]

Shlok 35b-36a: "You shall versify the heart pleasing and merit-yielding legend of Rama, and not a single 
word of yours will not be false in this epic... [1-2-35]

Shlok 36b-37a: "As long as the mountains and even rivers flourish on the surface of the earth, so long the 
legend of Ramayana will flourish in this world... [1-2-36]

Shlok 37b-38a: "And as long as Rama's legend authored by you flourishes...till then you will flourish in 
heavenly, in netherworlds, and even in my abode, namely Abode of Brahma... [1-2-37]

Shlok 38b: On saying thus that Divinity Brahma vanished then and there only, and then that godly sage 
Valmiki came by astonishment, along with his disciples. [1-2-38]

Shlok 39: Then all of the disciples of Valmiki sang this verse time and again very delightedly, and 
much astonished they also recited this verse, reciprocally. [1-2-39]

Shlok 40: Equally lettered, four-footed is that verse when great Sage Valmiki articulated it, and when 
repetitively recited by one and all, it attained prominence as verse proper. [1-2-40]

[Commentary] Comment: A poet never says poetry to satisfy his own instincts, but to imbue an involuntary 
imagination or passion in others when read or heard by the so called others. It is the empathy 
of that poetry. For Kalidasa it is shR^ingaara, passion, for Bhavabhuti it is pity 
'eko rasaH karuNaH...' for Valmiki it is pathos, shoka. For this Kavi Kalidas says:
niShaadaviddhaaNDajadarshanotthaH shlokatvamaapadyata yasya shokaH -- raghu va~Nsha 
14-70 There are two texts for this one is, shlokaH shlokatvam aagataH... meaning 
that the verse originally structured metrically can now can be sung. Second is shokaH 
shlokatvam aagataH... the pathos of the poet attained the status of verse that is now 
being sung by the disciples, thus anyone can recite it.

Shlok 41: Born is an intuition in that great sage and contemplated soul asserting that "I will compose 
entire Ramayana, the epic, in suchlike verses...' [1-2-41]

Shlok 42: That celebrated sage and magnanimous seer Valmiki then authored the highly renowned Rama's 
legend extolling Rama's renown, with symmetrically worded verses, and words versified to yield 
meanings semantically, prosody free-flowing, and with hundreds of such verses. [1-2-42]

Shlok 43: That epic contains uncomplicated compounds, conjunctions and conjugations, and has expressive 
sentences that are well knit and led evenly and sweetly, and that legend pertains to the best one 
from Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, which also includes the extermination of the Ten headed evil 
named Ravana, and further, it is said by the sage, hence this may now be listenedâ¦  [1-2-43]

[Commentary] This is balladeers bidding to the audience. The word munipraNiitam reminds that a 
non-saint cannot tell an epic; na anR^ishiH kurute kaavyam and hence it is to be listened 
attentively.



SARGA 3
------------------------------

[Text] The scheming of the composition of epic Ramayana is described here. Whole of the epic 
	is rendered in its quintessence, as to how Sage Valmiki scheduled the narration of important 
	milestones of the epic.

Shlok 1: On hearing the essence of Ramayana from Sage Narada, which is abound with probity and 
	prosperity, and a propitious one too, that virtue-souled Valmiki started searching for 
	further known details in the legend of that dexterous Rama. [1-3-1]

Shlok 2: Valmiki sitting on a sacred grass mat, whose apices are towards east, touched waters, 
	and made his palms adjoined in reverence, and then by his yogic insight started to search 
	comprehensively, for the narrative course of Ramayana. [1-3-2]

[Commentary] Comment: Touching/sipping waters aachamana, pariSechana , before undertaking 
	any auspicious work, including daily meal, is customary, because water cleanses the internal 
	system, both mind and body.

Shlok 3-4: Of Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, also of King Dasharatha and his wives, and what bechanced 
	on Rama when he was in kingdom Ayodhya; Valmiki veritably discerned all that. Their smiles, 
	their conversations, their deeds and the succession of events as well, all of them the 
	sage saw wholly and clearly by the yogic power conferred by Brahma...] [1-3-3,4]

Shlok 5: Then, that which bechanced on truth-abiding Rama, while he is trekking in forests, with 
	a lady being the third partner, where Lakshmana is the lone male aide, Valmiki visualized 
	all that. [1-3-5]

Shlok 6: Then that virtue-souled sage saw what all that has happened earlier, by his yogic exaltation, 
	as though it is a citric fruit in his own palm. [1-3-6]

Shlok 7-8: Discerning all of Ramayana in its actuality by his yogic prowess that highly intellectual 
	Valmiki pioneered to author all of the legend of Rama, for Rama is a delighter of all 
	in all worlds, and whose legend is abounding with the real functional qualities of earthly 
	pleasures and prosperities, and which clearly elaborates the meaning of probity and its 
	operative qualities, and thus this legend is like an ocean replete with such gems called 
	thoughts, and an ear-pleasing legend, as well. [1-3-7, 8]

[Commentary] Comment: The pleasures and gains of the humans are puruSaartha -s, in its axiological 
	meaning. Hindus have four such puruSaartha -s [namely human values,] dharma 
	probity artha prosperity, kaama pleasures, and finally mokSha 
	, blessedness. Of these four only the first three, dharma, artha, kaama are usually 
	referred, and they are called tri-varga . The final one mokSha is not 
	often quoted. Dhrama is the driving force. chodanaa lakShaNaartho dharmaH - Jaimini. 
	Hence dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and it 
	does not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty or, say 'categorical 
	imperative' of Kant. And the other two, artha, kaama , are the means of dharma, 
	and all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured 
	on these puruSaartha -s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts 
	of richness and glory of all kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its 
	main import is the virtuosity of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other 
	less valuable items like conch shells, mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all 
	these peripherals are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody 
	and heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its import is 
	in accordance with all the scriptures.

Shlok 9: That godly saint Valmiki composed the legend of Rama, the legatee of Raghu, exactly as 
	the divine-soul Narada narrated it earlier. [1-3-9]

Shlok 10: The birth of Rama as an incarnation of Vishnu, his very great valour, his gracefulness 
	to all, his universal cordiality, perseverance, courteousness, and his truthful conduct, 
	Valmiki described them all. [1-3-10]

Shlok 11: Narrated are very many other amusing stories, Rama's breaking the great bow; his associated with
	sage vishvamitra... [1-3-11]

Shlok 12: Dispute of Rama and Parashurama; the merits of Rama, the son of Dasharatha; and the preparations 
	for anointing of Rama as crown prince; Queen Kaikeyi's vicious intentions... [1-3-12]

[Commentary] Comment: Rama is shriiraama one who delights in shrii , where shrii 
	is Goddess Lakshmi. Where as Parashurama delights in his axe parashu axe; and 
	Balarama, the brother of Krishna delights in his own bala might.

Shlok 13: Disruption in royal unction of Raghava; his exile to forests; King Dasharatha's grief 
	and bewailing, and thus his departing to other worlds... [1-3-13]

Shlok 14: The grief of the subjects; Rama leaving them off; his conversing with tribal chief Guha; 
	returning the charioteer Sumantra to kingdom from forests, leaving the trio at the banks 
	of river Ganga... all these elements are well- described. [1-3-14]

Shlok 15: Crossing over River Ganga; looking up Sage Bharadwaja; their look up at Chitrakuta on 
	Sage Bharadwaja's advise... [1-3-15]

Shlok 16: Construction of a hermitage and dwelling therein; Bharata's arrival at that place for 
	the graciousness of Rama to take back the kingdom; Rama's denial of it; Rama's offering 
	water oblations to his father on hearing the demise of his father... [1-3-16]

Shlok 17: Enthroning shoe-sandals of Rama by Bharata; Bharata's living in a village Nandigrama; 
	Rama's going to Dandaka forests; killing the demon named Viradha... [1-3-17]

Shlok 18: Rama's visit to Sage Sarabhanga and Suteekshna; their visiting hermitic lady Anasuuya, 
	and her smooth speaking with Seetha and also her giving a body cream to Seetha...[by applying 
	which cream Seetha will not wither away in the rough weather of woods. These details are 
	incorporated with great care.] [1-3-18]

Shlok 19: Also even Rama's seeing the Sage Agastya, and likewise taking a great bow from that sage... 
	also the palaver of Surpanakha, the demoness, and defacing her, likewise... [1-3-19]

Shlok 20: The elimination of demons like Khara, Trishirasa and the upsurge of Ravana thereby; 
	elimination of demon Mareecha, and Ravana's abduction of Vaidehi, likewise... [1-3-20]

Shlok 21: Raghava's anguish at the loss of Seetha; Ravana's slaying the mighty eagle Jatayu; Rama's 
	seeing Kabandha, and also Lake Pampa...[1-3-21]

Shlok 22: Rama's seeing Shabari, a hermetic lady and eating fruits and tubers given by her in utmost 
	adoration; Rama's bemoaning for Seetha; his sighting Hanuma at Lake Pampa... [1-3-22]

Shlok 23: Also going to Mt. Rishyamuka, meeting Sugreeva and generating confidence in Sugreeva, 
	befriending him and the duel of Vali and Sugreeva... [1-3-23]

Shlok 24: Also thus Vali's elimination and establishing Sugreeva on throne of monkey kingdom, grieving 
	of Tara, the wife of Vali and empress of that kingdom, and as consented Rama's stopover 
	during the days of rain... [1-3-24]

[Commentary] Comment: This raatri usually means night. But it includes day also. When saying
	triraatra, dasharaatra, in conducting rituals it includes daytime also. On the 
	whole it is total rainy season that is admirably narrated in KiShkindhaa Kanda.

Shlok 25: The wrath of Raghava, the lion, at the delay caused by Sugreeva, and Sugreeva's foregathering 
	of all troops, and sending them to all quarters, and Sugreeva's description of earth's 
	topography to monkey-troops... [1-3-25]

Shlok 26: Rama's giving his ring to Hanuma as a token for Seetha's recognition... and the monkeys 
	thus searching Riksha cave, bear-cave, and their fasting unto death for their quest 
	remained unsuccessful, and their seeing Sampaati, another mighty eagle and the brother 
	of slain Jatayu, who guides the monkeys to the destination where Seetha is held captive. 
	[1-3-26]

Shlok 27: Hanuma's climbing Mt. Mahendra to leap over the ocean, and on the advice of the Ocean, 
	Mt. Mainaka's coming up from under waters to give rest to Hanuma, and Hanuma's seeing 
	that mountain are depicted. [1-3-27]

Shlok 28: Hanuma's killing the demoness Surasa, and his seeing of Simhika, a rapacious creature 
	of gigantic origin, which captures its prey by the shadow, and Hanuma's killing that Simhika, 
	and his seeing the mountain of Lanka, called Mt. Trikuta, on which the state of Lanka 
	is built, Valmiki described them all. [1-3-28]

Shlok 29: In night Hanuma's entry into Lanka, for being lonely his thinking over the course to search 
	for Seetha, and his going to the liquor consumption place, and also his seeing the palace 
	chambers of Ravana... [1-3-29]

Shlok 30: Hanuma's seeing Ravana, and also his seeing Pushpaka, the divine aircraft, and wandering in Ashoka 
	gardens, his seeing Seetha also... [1-3-30]

Shlok 31: Presenting his credential, the ring of Rama, to Seetha and his talk with Seeta, and also 
	his witnessing the demonesses scaring Seetha to oblige Ravana, and his witnessing demoness 
	Trijata narrating her bad dream, are all narrated in the epic. [1-3-31]

Shlok 32: Seetha's giving her bejeweled hairslide to be shown to Rama, Hanuma's uprooting of the 
	trees of that beautiful Ashoka gardens, thereby the demonesses fleeing in scare, his killing 
	the guards of that garden... [1-3-32]

	Ravana, and also Hanuma's burning down Lanka, and his blaring at the demons, also his 
	return flight from Lanka... and on his way back Hanuma's seeing a honey garden, and the 
	appropriation of honey... [1-3-33]

Shlok 34: Hanuma's action in presenting the jewel sent by Seetha solaces Raghava, and thus the meeting

	and Vibheeshana, the younger brother of Ravana, whom Ravana banished, comes to meet Rama, 
	and his telling the scheme to kill Ravana to Rama... [1-3-35]

Shlok 37: Crowning of Vibheeshana as the king of Lanka, after the demise of Ravana, and also Rama's 
	seeing Pushpaka, the divine aircraft, and returning to Ayodhya in that aircraft... and 
	Rama's meeting Sage Bharadvaja on his way back... [1-3-37]

Shlok 38: Sending Hanuma to meet Bharata, for he avowed to self-immolate if Rama were not to come 
	in time; the coronation festival of Rama; disbandment of all military troops of monkeys; 
	Rama's ruling his kingdom to the delight of his subjects, and the desolation of Vaidehi 
	too... are described by Valmiki. [1-3-38]

Shlok 39: The godly sage Valmiki composed the futuristic legend of Rama while Rama is on the surface 
	of earth, and whatever that is there, that is composed in all its minuteness, in the coming 
	chapters of this epic. [1-3-39]

[Commentary] Comment: In this verse, some take the word uttare as Uttara Ramayana, the events 
	occurring after his crowning, Seetha's departure to forest, birth of Lava and Kusha, the 
	sons of Rama and a battle between father and sons etc., are ascribed to Valmiki. But to 
	some commentators, as per the format of this chapter, which surveys what Valmiki has scheduled 
	to write, it is unacceptable since the word uttare occurs for only one occasion, 
	hence cannot mean next canto. Thus, they say, Uttara Ramayana cannot be ascribed to Valmiki. 
	Hence the word uttare here is taken to mean henceforth, hereinafter of the epic.



SARGA 4
------------------------------

[Text] Valmiki composed twenty four thousand verses and taught them to Lava and Kusha, the sons of 
Rama and Seetha. The two youngsters sing the ballad among the assemblages of sages and saints, 
and win laurels. Rama on seeing the boys singing on the streets and king's ways of Ayodhya, 
brings them to his palace, and summons all his brothers and ministers to listen to the ballad. 
Rama himself is put to the turmoil, for the ballad sung by these youngsters narrates the legend 
of Seetha. But he himself collecting his calm, Rama paid his attention to listen the 'Legend 
of Seetha' siithaayaH charitam mahat as Valmiki calls Ramayana.

Shlok 1: The godly saint Valmiki composed Ramayana on Rama's retrieving kingdom, wording admirably 
and meaningfully. [1-4-1]

Shlok 2: Sage Valmiki said Ramayana in twenty four thousand verses, in five hundred chapters, in six 
books, likewise an end-piece too. [1-4-2]

[Commentary] The twenty-four are the letters in Gayatri hymn. Ramayana's scheming is based on 
Gayatri hymn and for this: atra caturvi~Nshatisa~Nkhyo uktyaa caturvi~NshatyakSharagaayatrii 
tulyataa suucitaa | prathamaadhyaaye - tapaHsvaadhyaaya - ityatra 
prathamam takaarasya - sargaante - mahatvamiiyaat -- ityatra yaat 
- iti akSharasya grahaNaat api gaayatriiruupatvam suucitam - dharmaakuutam

[Commentary] There is a controversy about the number of verses and cantos. If Uttara Ramayana, otherwise 
called abhudaya-kaanDa, is ascribed to Valmiki, the cantos are seven and chapters 
are about 649 and verses are about 24,253. But some verses and chapters are deleted for standardization 
of Ramayana as per this verse and they contain 560 chapters and 24,00 verses only. Some argue 
that when it is said 24,000 verses are there, it does not actually a mathematical assertion, 
like the calculation of mahaayuga -s and manvantara -s, and as one would 
give a reply to his age as 30 years, or 60 years, but not as 29 years, 6 months, seven days 
or so... In furthering that standardization affair, some said that even this canto, Bala kaanda 
is not authored by Valmiki. It is not clear as of now when the pundits can decide as to which 
is standard and which is not.

[Commentary] The transcendental aspect of Ramayana and its content is explained in 18 terms by ancient 
commentator Govindaraja. 1] Rama's Absoluteness, paramaatmatattva ; 2] Ideation 
to know Him, upaaya ; 3] Dedication in Him, kainkarya ; 4] Human aspect,
puruSaakaara ; 5] Diviner, adhikaara ; 6] Resolve in God, adhikaarapaaratantrya

 ; 7] God's resolve in Dedicate, bhagavatpaaratantrya ; 8] Knowledge 
of five Meanings, arthapancakaj~naana ; 9] Self-denial, akincanatvam ; 
10] Teacher selecting, aacaaryavaraNam ; 11] Climax, autkaNThataa ; 12] 
Behaviour, pravartanaa ; 13] Residence, vaasasthaana ; 14] Two Narayana 
hymns, naaraayaNamantradvaya ; 15] Gayatri, Gayatri hymn; 16] Negating 
negative-thinking, durvicaaraparihaara ; 17] negating Love for Living, samsaarajihaasa
 ; 18] 64 Divinely Arts, catuHSaSTi-kalaamayatva . Of them we take up the 15th Gayatri.

[Commentary] The identification of Gayatri with Ramayana scheme is explained in many ways. By
tat savitR^i the features and attributes of the Absolute as per narrations in Bala 
Kanda. vareNya by the narration of Absolute's attributes in Ayodhya and Kishkindha 
kaanda-s, and adherents like Lakshmana, Bharata, Sugreeva take shelter in Him here only.
bharga is identified as per the description of resplendence of The Divine as envisaged 
by the sages and hermits in Aranya Kanda. devasya and in dhiimahi where 
that deva the Divine is explained by Hanuma, not only to Seetha but to all in Sundara 
kanda. hi dhii mahi is as explained in Uttara Kanda, which centers around mokSha 
salvation.

Shlok 3: Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint 
thought over thus 'really, who will render all this ballad...' [1-4-3]

Shlok 4: Then Lava and Kusha who are in the attire of hermits have touched the feet of that contemplative 
soul Valmiki, who is now thoughtful. [1-4-4]

Shlok 5: Glorious Kusha and Lava are the virtue knowing princes, and they are endowed with melodious 
voice, besides being the residents of the same hermitage, thus Valmiki saw them saluting at 
his feet. [1-4-5]

Shlok 6: On seeing that pair intellectuals who are proficient in Veda-s that self-reliant sage Valmiki 
made those two to memorize the epic, as the epic Ramayana is composed only to reinforce the 
import of Veda-s, as an ancillary. [1-4-6]

Shlok 7: That sage with observed sacred vows has rendered the entire epic in the name of 'Ramayana', 
'Sublime Legend of Seetha' and 'elimination of Ravana'. [1-4-7]

[Commentary] Seetha's conduct is the primary aspect and Ravana's elimination is secondary in the epic of 
Ramayana. poulasthyavadha . Giving one to many names to poem/epics is usual as in
maaghakaavya' which is known as shishupaalavadha whereas it is actually
kR^iShNacarita .

Shlok 8: To read or to sing it is melodious, adaptable to music with three scales and sevenfold tune, 
and orchestral to the tunes of string-instrument and rhythm included... [1-4-8]

[Commentary] The three Indian scale pauses are dR^ita, madhyama, vilambita . These though not 
equal but identical to Breve, Minim and Quaver of Western classical music. The seven fold 
classifications of swara-s are 1] shadja [2] madhyama [3] gaandhaara [4] niSaada [5] R^iSabha 
[6] dhaivata [7] pa~nchama . These are roughly identical to Accelerando, Calando, Decresando, 
Smorzando, Sostentuo, and others of Western classical music.

Shlok 9: Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung 
[by Kusha, Lava.] [1-4-9]

[Commentary] The Indian categorization of aesthetics rasaa -s is in nine emotions. sR^ingaara 
[romance] haasa  [humour] shoka [grief] krodha [fury]
utsaaha [enthusiasm, bravery] bhaya [fright] 
jugupsaa [disgust] vismaya [amaze.] Again sR^ingaara is 
of two kinds - a] sambhoga , [being with his/her partner,] b] vipralamba 
[not being with his/her partner.]

[Commentary] Rama's togetherness with Seetha from Bala Kanda till her abduction is the first category of 
romance. After her departure and until regain, it is second sort of romantic narration. Episodes 
of Surpanakha, Trijata are humorous. Those of Dasharatha, Jatayu etc., are of grievous nature. 
Killing, torturing etc., situations arouse furiousness. Lakshmana, Indrjit and others are 
showing bravery. Seeing ugly demons either in forests or those that surround Seetha is causing 
fright. The very sight of ugly bodied demons like Viradha, Kabandha is creating disgust. Hanuma's 
leaping ocean, burning Lanka, and the entire Rama-Ravana war are amazing

Shlok 10: They are conversant with the art of music and proficient with the pitch and pausing their 
voices, and those two brothers have not only a wealthy voice, but they also look like celestial 
singers. [1-4-10]

[Commentary] The gandharva-s are celestial beings with adorable personalities and performers of all kinds 
of performing arts. Hence, Indian musical art is termed as gaandhava-vidyaa.

Shlok 11: They have charm in their appearance and melodiousness in their voice, they are like the two 
reflections of one original object, and thus they came out from the body of Rama, separately. 
[1-4-11]

[Commentary] Vishnu's reflection is Rama; and Kusha, Lava are two reflections of Rama, and thus, in turn, 
these two princes are adorable like Vishnu, as in bimba-pratibimba nyaaya , image-reflection 
syndrome.

Shlok 12: They the princes have memorized that virtue-expounding epic, the best; in its entirety and 
in doing so, they rendered that epic faultlessly. [1-4-12]

Shlok 13: They sung the epic as schooled, well aware of its content and intent, among the assemblages 
of sages, scholars and also of eminent persons, with their best concentration [1-4-13]

Shlok 14: Once those two great-souls who endowed with musical talent and with all remarkable features, 
sung this epic, standing nearby the midst of a gathering of sages and pious souls. [1-4-14]

Shlok 15: On hearing that, the eyes of all the sages were overspread with tears of happiness, and they 
appreciated saying, 'splendid, splendid is this...' [1-4-15]

Shlok 16: All those saints being the saint-patrons of virtue are pleased at heart, and praised the praiseworthy 
Kusha and Lava, while they are singing. [1-4-16]

Shlok 17: "The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... though this has 
happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... [1-4-17]

Shlok 18: "On getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, that too melodiously 
and rapturously, marinating the pitch and tune..." So said the saints. [1-4-18]

Shlok 19: While the great saints of blessed ascesis are appreciating that way, those two melodiously 
sang very effectually and very meaningfully. [1-4-19]

Shlok 20: And someone, a pleased saint, got up and bestowed a handy vessel to them... another reputed 
sage, lauding them contributed a jute robe. [1-4-20]

Shlok 21-26: And another sage bestowed a black-deerskin, and like that yet another a sacred thread... someone 
gave a water-pot and another great saint a girdle of maunja grass to singers, while that way 
another contributed an under cloth; another sage gladly contributed a hatchet to them, another 
a saffron clothe, and yet another saint bestowed a cloth-wrapper; another delivered tuft-headband 
also, and another enchanted for their singing ballad handed out a sacrificial vessel, and 
another a bundle of firewood sticks, and yet another gave a plank-seat of audambari wood, 
and other called forth blessings, and someone then happily chanted bless-hymns for longevity... 
there by all the truth-avowing saints, those that are great sages have thus bestowed boons. 
[1-4-21-26]

Shlok 26: "Surprising is this well-said rendering of Valmiki... it is the subsistence for tomorrow's 
poets... and this is completed sequentially, as well... [1-4-26]

Shlok 27-28: While this song that generates longevity and prosperity, and one that is melodious one to 
all ears is being sung everywhere in streets and king's ways and while those two singers who 
are experts in singing any kind of music are being appreciated everywhere, Rama has seen them. 
[1-4-27-28]

Shlok 29: Then on seeing them Rama, the enemy-eliminator, fetched those honour-worthy bothers, Lava 
and Kusha, to his palace and honoured them. [1-4-29]

Shlok 30: He that king Rama is then surrounded by his ministers and brothers that are sitting his nearby, 
he himself sat on a divine golden throne. [1-4-30]

Shlok 31: Having seen the mannerly brothers endowed with beautiful features, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, 
and Shatrughna, and Bharata likewise. [1-4-31]

Shlok 32: Rama said to thus, "Let this ballad be keenly heard from these divinely resplendent brothers, 
for it contains versatile words and meanings...' and thus he motivated the singers. [1-4-32]

Shlok 33: Even those two singers have sung the ballad melodiously and effectually, with their clear 
and clarified voices, like the melody of string and rhythmic instruments, with very clear 
and meaningful intonation. [1-4-33]

Shlok 34: Enthralling courtier's bodies, minds and hearts also, and thus that song shone forth as it 
is for all ears, bearing a comfort in its manifestation, among the gathering of the people. 
[1-4-34]

Shlok 35: "These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who also possess kingly features, but they are great 
hermits... this narration is endowing good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious 
legend [of Seetha...]" [So said Rama to those courtiers.] [1-4-35]

[Commentary] Here Rama tells that this legend is 'efficacious' for it is the legend of Seetha, and should 
it be Rama's alone, he will get the blemish of self-glorification, aatmaprashamsaa doSa 
, and brave heroes of legends cannot be subjected to such a blemish. And to listen to the 
legend of his dearest, who at present is not with him, gives a kind of consolation, and thus 
he is asking all of us to listen to siitaayaH caritam mahat ...

Shlok 36: Then those two singers, motivated by Rama's words, sang the ballad in maarga system, for they 
are well versed in it, then even Rama, who is also in the congregation, again to pacify his 
mind, [for the story of Seetha puts his mind to turmoil,] became interested at heart [to continue 
listening Seetha's story...] [1-4-36]



SARGA 5
------------------------------

[Text] We enter the capital of the Emperor Dasharatha. The pomp and glory of his capital is depicted 
along with its town planning and grandeur of the city, and its residents.

Shlok 1-3: Once upon a time, under which victorious kings, starting from Prajapati-s, this entire earth with all its islands is there, among which kings one 
king named Sagara is there, well-known for his deepening the oceans, 
and whom his sixty thousand sons were fencing in when he is set out for action, in the dynasty 
of such Ikshvaku kings this highly revered and reputed epic Ramayana is originated. 
[1-5-1, 3]

Shlok 4: Being such a legend, we two wish to relate this Ramayana entirely and completely from the 
beginning, which is endowed with the values and means of probity, prosperity, and pleasure 
seeking... and this be listened without any caviling. [1-5-4]

Shlok 5: A great kingdom named Kosala, a joyous and a vast one well flourishing with monies and cereals, 
is snugly situated on the riverbanks of Sarayu. [1-5-5]

Shlok 6: A world-renowned city is there in that kingdom, which is personally built by Manu, the foremost 
ruler of mankind. [1-4-6]

Shlok 7: That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s 
breadth wise. [1-5-7]

[Commentary] Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles. 
Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3/4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one
dhanu-graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu-muSTi - fist with thumb 
raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last 
finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one
danDa, dhanuS - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danDa-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s 
= 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanuS-s = one krosha , and also called
goraTa - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 
10 miles. But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries 
say that one yojana is 5 miles. But traditionally it is held as 10 miles. More info on these 
measures can be had from The Artha-Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin.

Shlok 8: That city shines forth with well-laid great royal highways that are always wetted with water, 
and with flowers strewn and scattered on them. [1-5-8]

Shlok 9: As an improver of great kingdom Dasharatha the king made her as his abode, as Indra made heavens 
as his abode. [1-5-9]

Shlok 10: That city is surrounded with gateways and archways; the front yards of buildings are well 
laid; it is lodges all kinds of machinery, weaponry and craftsmen, and king Dasharatha dwells 
in such a city. [1-4-10]

Shlok 11: She that prosperous city Ayodhya is muchly crammed with many a eulogist and panegyrist, yet 
she is highly splendorous with many a bastion, flag and hundreds of batteries of canons, and 
Dasharatha dwells therein. [1-5-11]

[Commentary] Comment: This shataghnii literally is that which can kill a hundred people, and 
it is said to be a canon and also said to be thorny weapon: shataghniicatuHtalaalohakaNTakasa~ncitaa |
 ayaHkaNTakasa~ncchannaa mahatii shilaa -- elaborate accounts of 
this shataghni, kshipaNi are there in yajuraaraNyaka .

Shlok 12: That city Ayodhya accommodates groups of danseuses and theatrical personnel, and she is surrounded 
everywhere with the gardens and brakes of mango trees, and her wide fort-wall is like her 
cincture ornament. [1-5-12]

Shlok 13: That Ayodhya is an impassable one for trespassers, or for others invaders, owing to her impassable 
and profound moats, and she is abounding with horses, camels, likewise with cows and donkeys. 
[1-5-13]

Shlok 14: With the throngs of provincial kings who come hither to pay dues pervade that city, and she 
is verily lustrous with residents of various other countries, and with traders, too. In such 
a city Dasharatha dwells. [1-5-14]

Shlok 15: Buildings are ornamentally studded with precious gems, and with such multi-storied sky scrappers 
she is adorned, and filled with them she is like Amaravati, the capital of Indra. [1-5-15]

Shlok 16: Amazing is Ayodhya for its lay-out is like a game board called aSTapadi, and with 
its flocks of beautiful women moving thereabout, where all kinds of precious gems are heaped 
up, and where its seven storied buildings are picturesque. [1-5-16]

Shlok 17: The housing is very dense and there is no place or ground unutilized, and all are constructed 
on well-levelled lands, and rice-grain is plentiful while the drinking water tastes like sugar 
cane juice. [1-5-17]

Shlok 18: That city is sounding with the drumbeats of great drums, and with musical rhythm instruments 
like mridanga, cymbals, and with string instruments like Veena etc., and on earth she is uniquely 
the best city. [1-5-18]

[Commentary] Great drums, called dundubhi , placed on castle walls and at central places to drum 
the times of the day or night, or at the arrivals of the noblemen or to keep the sentry whistles. 
As well, the melodious tunes from string instruments like Veena or rhythmic instrument
mridanga and from various other instruments are always made available to the citizens, 
as a sort of background music, since royalty sponsors these performing arts.

Shlok 19: Ayodhya is like a hovering space station attained by sages by their ascesis, and its edifices 
are well planned and it is teeming with best people. [1-4-19]

Shlok 20: They the skilful archers of that Ayodhya will not kill a lone one with their arrows, one that 
does not have either a predecessor or a successor in his family, a fleeing one, or by listening 
to the sound of the target, as is done in sonic-archery, and their skills, acumen and handiness 
are thus benevolent. [1-5-20]

[Commentary] Dasharatha in his youth, when he was on a hunting spree, killed the son of a hermit who was 
drawing water from a river. That son of the sage dipped his pot in the waters and the filling 
water gave sounds like that of a grumbling tiger. Dasharatha mistook that sound to be a tiger's 
grumble and swung his arrow that way, killing the boy. Thereby the father of the boy being 
a sage of eminence, cursed Dasharatha to die lamenting for his son, which happens after the 
exile of Rama. Perhaps the sonic-archery may thus have been banned in Ayodhya, lest such sad 
incidents would have recurred.

Shlok 21: They kill the fattened and roaring lions, tigers and wild boars with the might of their sharp 
weaponry, or even with the might of their own arms alone. [1-4-21]

Shlok 22: With that kind of thousands of archers, and with speediest chariot-warriors she that Ayodhya 
is filled with, and King Dasharatha made his abode in such a city. [1-5-22]

Shlok 23: She that Ayodhya is encompassed with Vedic scholars who always worship the ritual fire by 
enkindling the three kinds of ritual-fires continuously, virtuous Brahman scholars in Veda-s 
and their six ancillary subjects, and other great souls that are in similitude with great 
saints, and who are just like sages that are charitable donors, and that abide by the truth. 
[1-5-23]



SARGA 6
------------------------------

[Text] The riches and happiness enjoyed by the people, under the rein of Emperor Dasharatha, 
			along with the details of its valiant heroes, elephants, horses and the town planning 
			are narrated.

Shlok 1-4: He who is well-versed in Veda-s, who is a gatherer of all scholars, riches and 
			forces as well, a foreseer and a great resplendent one, also one who is esteemed 
			by urbanites and countrymen alike, one who is a top-speeded chariot-warrior among 
			the emperors of Ikshwaku kings, one who has performed many Vedic rituals, a virtuous 
			one, a great controller, a saint-like kingly sage, one who he is renowned in all 
			the three worlds, a mighty one with all his enemies eradicated, nevertheless who 
			has friends, one who conquered all his senses, one who is similar to Indra, or 
			Kubera on earth with his wealth, accumulations and other possessions, he that 
			king Dasharatha while dwelling in the city of Ayodhya protected the world, like 
			Manu, the foremost protector of mankind. [1-6-3,4,5]

Shlok 5: He that truth-abiding king, who adheres to the three-fold virtues rules the vast 
			of that kingdom from that best city Ayodhya, as Indra rules heaven from his capital 
			Amaravati. [1-6-5]

Shlok 6: In that best city Ayodhya all are exuberant yet virtuous ones, and scholars are 
			variously learned ones, people are satisfied with their own riches, they have 
			no greed, and they advocate truthfulness alone. [1-6-6]

Shlok 7: None with meagre accumulations is there in that great city and no householder 
			is there without unearned means, and without cows, horses, monies or cereals and 
			who could not sustain his family. [1-6-7]

[Commentary] An ordinary family kuTumba is an assemblage of the householder, his wife, 
			two of his parents, two sons, two daughters-in-law, one daughter, and one guest, 
			totalling to ten members.

Shlok 8: None can see a lustful person, or a miser or a cruel one anywhere in that Ayodhya, 
			along with nondescripts or non-believers, for there are no such persons. [1-6-8]

Shlok 9: All the ladies and gentlemen in that city are virtuous in mind, self-controlled 
			ones, they are all self-satisfied like great saints, and both in their conduct 
			and character they are blameless. [1-6-9]

Shlok 10: In that city none is there without his earrings, headgear, or garlands, none is 
			an enjoyer of lowly things, or misses his regular oil-baths, or with an un-creamed 
			body with sandalwood paste or with other body cream, or with an un-perfumed physique. 
			[1-6-10]

[Commentary] Earrings are the indicators of scholarship, and there are grades in their make 
			and design, on par with the education one receives. The headgears present their 
			social status, while other decorations are to exhibit their lavishness.

Shlok 11: There is none who is famsihed, an uncharitable one in his nature, one with an 
			undecorated body with ornaments like bracelets or chest plates, and there is none 
			without a heart. [1-6-11]

Shlok 12: There is none someone who is without sacrificial fires, and none without performing 
			sacrificial rituals, and none is low in living; neither an immoral, nor a bastard 
			nor even a thief, can be found in Ayodhya. [1-6-12]

Shlok 13: The sense-controlled scholarly Vedic Brahmans are always engaged in their rituals, 
			and they donate the education of Vedas to their students, as well practice their 
			own, and while receiving donations they are principle-minded. [1-6-13]

[Commentary] The donations received by Vedic scholars are not alms to beggars or charities 
			to the destitute. The Vedic scholars do not receive them from anybody or everybody. 
			There are set rules to accept such donations like cows, gold coins, villages, 
			temples etc., from a befitting hand. Otherwise, the recipient is destined to go 
			to Hell for having received greedily. Thus, if ever somebody wants to donate to 
			such a scholar he should first notify his bona fides, which are verifiable by 
			the recipient. Another kind of donation is referred here as daana-aadhyaana, 
			meaning that these scholars while receiving donations from a righteous source, 
			they also have to donate something to others. It is the education in Veda, which 
			they have to impart to their students free of any charge and that too, to the 
			befitting students only. Thus, the words, daana and pratigrahaNa 
			mean all these rules to accept a donation or to accord it.

Shlok 14: There is no atheist, no liar, and none is less learnt in Veda-s, and no one is 
			found to be jealous, or disabled, or unscholarly person. [1-6-14]

Shlok 15: None can be found anywhere in Ayodhya without the knowledge of the six ancillaries 
			of Veda-s like astrology, prosody, grammar etc., none a non-performer of the prescribed 
			rituals, and none a non-donor in thousands, thus none with a saddened heart, turmoil 
			in mind or agonised in will is there. [1-6-15]

Shlok 16: Whoever it may be, either a gentleman or a lady, none is without wealth, even 
			none without elegance or devoid of devotion to their king, and it is impossible 
			to see suchlike person in Ayodhya. [1-6-16]

Shlok 17: In the four-caste system, from the first caste to the last, everyone is a worshipper 
			of deities and guests and everyone is also faithful, illustrious, valiant, and 
			each one is a brave one. [1-6-17]

[Commentary] Though the word 'caste - Spanish and Portuguese casta - lineage, race, breed' is 
			distasteful, it is used here for an easy communication. Latin classis - assembly' 
			or section of society would be more suitable.

Shlok 18: Longevity is there for all of the people, all are with virtuosity and truthfulness, 
			and they lived in that best city along with their sons, grandsons and their ladies. 
			[1-6-18]

Shlok 19: The warrior class Kshatriya-s is turned towards the Brahmans, the scholarly class, 
			for intellectual and religious support. The trading class, Vaisya-s, is the follower 
			of the Kshatriya-s, the ruling class, for the state's economy is dependent on 
			the rulership. And the fourth one, Shuudra-s, the working class, while performing 
			its own duties, is always working for the other castes. [1-6-19]

Shlok 20: That city is well protected by that king from Ikshwaku dynasty namely Dasharatha, 
			like Manu, the foremost king of mankind in earlier times. [1-6-20]

Shlok 21: That city Ayodhya is replete with firebrand like skillful warriors that are intolerant 
			of insults, and who have prosecuted their education in archery, chariot-wars, 
			swordplay etc. and with them it is like a cave replete with lions. [1-6-21]

Shlok 22: That city is full with best horses born in countries like Kaambhoja, Baahlika, 
			Vanaayu, and also in river-bed counties, which are like the horse of Indra namely 
			ucChaishrava. [1-6-22]

[Commentary] It is said that the horses born in the rivers nadii+ja are brought to the city 
			Ayodhya. They are not water horses but horses born at the place where the historically 
			prominent Seven Rivers of Indus Valley Rivers flow.

[Commentary] Here again an account of countries 
			is given as a glimpse. These countries Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu may not be taken 
			as the provincial countries within the present day India. Prior to the present-day 
			peninsular India, the belt from Himalayas to Alps had a great rapport in cultural 
			and trade exchanges without demarcations of east or west, which paved the way 
			for Alexander, the Great, towards India.

[Commentary] Sometime back, say during 1985-87, the 
			National Geography magazine contained a beautiful article under the heading "
			IRAQ, the crucible of civilisation ," Merle Severy, as its Asst. Editor. 
			In its carefully worded introduction, it is stated that Iraq is "the traditional 
			birthplace of man for Jews, Christians and Muslims... " On the other hand, 
			Hindus naturally believe that the Southward Himalayan region is the birthplace 
			of man. In the same article, the regions around Euphrates and Tigris are said 
			to be the "Fertile Crescent, the cradle of Western civilization ... in the 
			third millennium BC ". Further that " To the east a similar florescence 
			occurred in the Indus and Yellow River Valleys... " This florescence in Indus 
			Valley and far eastward did not occur later to Mesopotamian or Babylonian civilisations 
			but flourished much earlier, as per Hindu scripts and the dating of which is the 
			eternal question like Aryan Question. However, Hindu scripts centre the present 
			world, Bhuuloka, surrounding Meru Mountain and its geography includes the land 
			unto Rome, Russia, China. We will refer to Meru mountain-oriented geography and 
			its geographical account at the appropriate place. Since Ramayana dates back to 
			Buddhism and Buddhism's westward spread is unto Afghanistan, the Kings of Ramayana 
			must have had no problem to draft horses from Persian, Arabian or the other of 
			Middle East countries. These countries are always famous for horse breeding, right 
			from the days of Ramayana to Moses. Hence the accounts of horses and the countries 
			from where they are brought may be treated as cross-continental culture. Since 
			history believes only in the unearthed iconography and the epics or their content 
			can not stand to the carbon-testing, the countries named here as Kambhoja, Baahlika 
			may nearly mean Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Arabian or other unknown or unearthed 
			historic countries of the crucible of Western civilisation, Iraq. Vanaayu, another 
			country referred may nearly mean Roman, as Persians term Greeks as Unani in India, 
			advent to the arrival of Alexander, the Great. We still have an herbal medication 
			called Unani, a hybrid between Ayurveda, Greek and Persian herbal treatments.

Shlok 23: Born in Vindhya Mountains, and also from Himalayan regions, mighty are the elephants 
			fully vigorous and fattened ones, and most powerful in their strength and each 
			in similitude is a huge mountain. [1-6-23]

Shlok 24: High bred from the classes of Airavata, the Elephant of Lord Indra, and from Mahapadma, 
			Anjana and Vamana, too...are the elephants [of that city] [1-6-24]

[Commentary] It is said that eight elephants from eight corners called aSTadiggaja 
			support the Universe. And these eight elephants have their presiding deities. 
			From those eight elephants, four are prominent. They are Airaavata , the 
			Elephant of Indra, anjana , the Elephant of varuNa , the Rain-god,
			vaamana , the Elephant of Yama, the Lord of Death, and another is 
			punDariika . Thus, the elephants of Ayodhya are termed as divine breed.

Shlok 25-26a: That city is always full with vigorous and mountain like elephants bred mainly 
			from three classes viz., Bhadra, Mandra and Mriga. And inter-bred among these 
			three main classes are Bhadra-Mandra, Mandra-Mriga, Bhadra-Mriga and the like. 
			[1-6-25]

[Commentary] The bhadra is the elephant class for King's ride, called bhadragaja 
			. It is a state elephant with high honors and for occasional or ceremonial use.
			mandra and mR^iga are classes of breed tamed and used in wars 
			or for the ride of other nobility. These are the essential mammals used for other 
			lifting and carrying works.

Shlok 26b: While residing in which city King Dasharatha ruled the world that city is further 
			fortified up to two more yojana-s outside city, true to its name
			a yodhya , an un-assailable one. [1-6-26]

Shlok 27: In which city the great resplendent and admirable king Dasharatha resided, he 
			ruled the world from that city with silenced enemies, like the moon governing 
			the stars. [1-6-27]

Shlok 28: With gorgeous arches, castle-door-bars and with amazingly built houses that city 
			is magnificent and auspicious one, and full with thousands of provincial kings 
			too, and king Dasharatha, a coequal of Indra, indeed ruled that city which is 
			true to its name. [1-6-28]



SARGA 7
------------------------------

[Text] The truthful and upright characters of the ministers of Dasharatha are portrayed, 
			who make the rulership meaningful with their virtuous, skilful and efficient administration. 
			Along with the political ministers, the religious ministry is also portrayed.

Shlok 1: The misters for the great soul from Ikshvaku kings of Emperor Dasharatha, are 
			epitomised ones of their tactfulness, adroitness and are always obliged to undertake 
			welfare activities of their king and the kingdom. [1-7-1]

Shlok 2: Eight ministers are there for that valiant and glorious King Dasharatha, who are 
			clean at heart and are involved in the works of the king and kingdom at all time. 
			[1-7-2]

Shlok 3: Dhristi, Jayantha, Vijaya, Suraashtra, Raashtravardhana, Akopa, Dharmapaala, are 
			seven, and Sumantra is the eighth one. [1-7-3]

Shlok 4: Two venerable saints of eminence are religious ministers for they are authorities 
			in Vedic rituals, namely Vashishta and Vamadeva, who are the acquiescent with 
			religious matters, and apart from these two some more religious ministers are 
			also there to King Dasharatha. [1-7-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: Suyajna, Jabaali, Kaashyapa, Gautama, Maarkandeya, Deerghaayu, and then Kaatyayana 
			are the scholarly Brahmans acting as religious ministers, and along with them 
			there are also Brahma-sages who are always the ancestral ritual scholars for Dasharatha's 
			family. [1-7-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 8a: All the ministers are well versed in scriptures, they shun bad deeds, skilful 
			ones in their duties with their senses regulated. Those great souls are affluent, 
			knowers of all sciences, firmly courageous, and they are distinguished and quiet-souls, 
			and those ministers are true to their word. They are magnificent, patient and 
			famed ones and they smile afore they converse. [1-7-6b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: They never speak untruthful words in anger or in greed or for monetary reasons 
			either. There is nothing unknown to them, even a little, in their own country 
			or in the others either, or about everything that is happening or has happened, 
			or that is going to happen, for they know them through agents. [1-7-8b, 9]

Shlok 10: They are efficient in administration and their friendships are well examined by 
			the king, and those ministers impose punishment even on their own sons, if situation 
			demands it. [1-7-10]

Shlok 11: In collections to their treasury and to militarise their armies they are dutiful, 
			even an unfriendly person will not be tortured, if he were not really blameworthy. 
			[1-7-11]

Shlok 12: They are valiant ones with engineered enthusiasm, administrators of political 
			science, clean persons and protectors of subjects of their kingdom at all times. 
			[1-7-12]

Shlok 13: They do not persecute Brahman-s and Kshatriya-s to fill-up the treasury, and high 
			degree punishments will be given on assessing that person's, or the offender's 
			strength and weakness. [1-7-13]

Shlok 14: All of those ministers are clean administrators of kingdom, and are in league 
			with each other, as such there is none anywhere, either in capital or in country, 
			a liar. [1-7-14]

Shlok 15: None with an evil-mind or with an interest in other man's wife is there, and thus 
			on whole in the kingdom and also like that in the capital, there is an undisturbed 
			society. [1-7-15]

Shlok 16: Well-dressed and well-decorated and they the ministers of King Dasharatha, observe 
			decency in the interest of the king and also of the kingdom, with diligence and 
			with a truthful-eye. [1-7-16]

Shlok 17: They acquired good qualities from their mentors and they are renowned by their 
			expertise, and even in foreign countries they are famous for their intellectual 
			determinations in all affairs. [1-7-17]

Shlok 18: Versatile and virtuous are they the ministers and there is none who discarded 
			his virtuosity, and they are the determiners of truce or war, and by their nature 
			they possess opulence. [1-7-18]

Shlok 19: They are capable to keep up the confidentialities of strategies, and also capable 
			to apply their mind even in micro-affairs, and they know moral science comprehensively, 
			and above all, they are gentle articulators. [1-7-19]

Shlok 20: Accompanied with such of those effectual and good-natured ministers the exalted 
			king Dasharatha ruled the earth. [1-7-20]

Shlok 20-21: He that most generous one among men, Dasharatha, while observing through spies, 
			and to protect people righteously, and to give a good governance to them, he forsook 
			unrighteousness and became a generous king avowed to truthfulness alone, and thus 
			he that Dasharatha ruled the earth, which rulership is renowned in all the three 
			worlds. [1-7-21,22]

Shlok 23: Emperor Dasharatha has not encountered either a superior or an equal in his kingship, 
			and to him there are many friends, subdued are his provincial kings and eliminated 
			is thorniness by his own valour. He thus ruled the world like Indra would in Heaven. 
			[1-7-23]

Shlok 24: In the company of those ministers, who are conducive to the strategies, interested 
			in the king and subjects as well, skilful and efficient ones, he that King Dasharatha 
			obtained brilliance, like the rising Sun along with resplendent sunrays. [1-7-24]



SARGA 8
------------------------------

[Text] Dasharatha decides to perform an elaborate Vedic ritual, called Aswamedha yajna, Horse Ritual, to beget
children. He being a considerate king in taking conscience of the courtiers, he discusses this aspect with the Vedic
scholars and ministers of his court, beforehand.

Shlok 1: To him, to such an effectual and virtuously great-souled King Dasharatha, a dynasty-enriching son is
not begotten though his heart is burning to beget children. [1-8-1]

Shlok 2: To that anguished great-soul, a thought occurred this way, "To beget sons, why should not I perform
Horse ritual...[and thus appease the gods in order to beget worthy sons..."] [1-8-2]

Shlok 3: That intellectual and a conscientious king having resolved with all of his sagacious ministers that such
a Vedic ritual is performable, then addressed best ne among ministers, namely Sumantra, "fetch all my teachers and
clerics, quickly.." [1-8-3,4]

Shlok 5: Then Sumantra gone quickly, for he in quickness is a dauntless one, and fetched all of the clerics like
Suyajna, Vaama Deva, Jaabala, Kashyapa, and even Sage Vashishta, and also those other eminent Brahman that are Vedic
scholars. [1-8-5,6]

Shlok 7: Then on adoring them virtuous King Dasharatha spoke this impressible sentence that included
justification and meaning. [1-8-7]

Shlok 8: "My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... for that reason, I wish perform Aswamedha,
Vedic Horse Ritual... this is my thinking... [1-8-8]

Shlok 9: "Therefore, I contemplate to perform that ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and as a rite-oriented
one as well... let this contemplation of mine be well thought of... and as to how my desire to beget sons will be
fulfilled... [1-8-9]

Shlok 10: Then the Brahman scholars along with Sage Vashishta and all other important personalities in their turn
have blessed and honoured him, saying that "splendid is this idea..." thus, for that which is voiced by the king.
[1-8-10]

Shlok 11: All of them becoming happy have also said to King Dasharatha, "let the paraphernalia be provided, and
your ritual-horse be released... [1-8-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: "Oh, king, by all means you will beget sons as you desired, since you, to whom an upright thinking has
suggested itself... let the ritual ground be arranged on the northern banks of River Sarayu..." So said the scholars.
[1-8-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b: " Then King Dasharatha is gladdened on hearing the sayings of those Brahmans. And with happiness
lurching on his eyes the king spoke to the ministers, "As advised by my Vedic teachers let the paraphernalia be
procured... [1-8-13b, 14]

Shlok 15: "On the northern banks of River Sarayu the ritual ground be arranged... and the Ritual-Horse be released
monitored by capable warriors, along with the religious teachers..." So said the king. [1-8-15]

Shlok 16: "Let peace invocations be prevailing and prospering, as ordained in the scriptures and tradition...if it
is possible for the correct performance to obtain results of this ritual, and if it is possible to conduct this ritual
without any difficult faults during its performance, then all the kings on earth would have performed it... [1-8-16]

Shlok 17: "Scholarly Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults alone in the course of this ritual... should the
procedure of this ritual be depraved of its set rules, the performer gets ruined... [1-8-17]

Shlok 18: "Therefore, you all shall see as to how this ritual of mine be conducted and concluded procedurally, and
all of you are evidently experts in conducting such rituals... isn't it! [1-8-18]

[Commentary] Vedic Brahmans are to be very cautious and vigilant while performing the ritual in the order of
ritual acts, faultless rendering of the Vedic hymns and other observant items of the Vedic canon. Should they by
overconfidence or by negligence commit any mistake or fault, they take rebirth as Brahma-demons. After taking rebirth
as such demons they, with their inherent jealousy and ire will always be hunting for such mistakes in other's ritual
performances. If they cannot find one, they cause certain hindrances in that performance, so that the performer may
commit mistakes and get ruined in the present life span and then take rebirth as Brahma-demon. Hence, every
Vedic-ritual performer shall be vigilant.

Shlok 19: On listening the words of the king all the ministers adored and assured him saying, 'It will be
conducted faultlessly as has been conducted earlier...' [1-8-19]

Shlok 20: On hearing those words of that best king, and what that is spoken earlier, then the virtue knowing
Brahman scholars hailing that best king took leave of him and went away as they have come. [1-8-20]

Shlok 21: Then on sending off those Brahman scholars, the king spoke this way to the ministers... "As advised by
the Vedic scholars this ritual shall be conducted, procedurally..." [1-8-21]

Shlok 22: Tha tigerly-king and highly intellectual Dasharatha, on saying thus to his ministers who are still in
his audience, sent away those ministers also, and he entered his palace. [1-8-22]

Shlok 23: And on approaching his wives, that best king's heartily dear ones, he said to them, " I am performing a
Vedic ritual for the reason of begetting sons, and you all shall enter a vow..." [1-8-23]

Shlok 24: On hearing those words of the king, the lustrous countenances of the queens have become more gleaming,
like the blooming lotuses after the clearance of dew-fall. [1-8-24]

[Text] Sumantra, the minister of King Dasharatha, details the importance of Sage Rishyasringa and 
beseeches the king to invite that sage to preside over the contemplated Vedic ritual, for 
that Sage's entry into any kingdom is auspicious for that land and people.

Shlok 1: Sumantra, the charioteer and one of the misters of King Dasharatha, having heard all about 
the king's desire to perform a Vedic ritual, said this in confidence to king, "oh, king, I 
will tell an early legend, an early legendary narration that I listened... [1-9-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "Oh, king, I have earlier heard of this present advice given to you by Vedic scholars, as 
godly Sage Sanatkumara has once narrated an account about the arrival of your sons in the 
presence of other sages, and sage Sanat Kumara said... [1-9-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4: "He said that "Sage Kashyapa has a son known as Vibhaandaka, and his son will be the renowned 
Sage Rishyasringa, and that Sage Rishyasringa will grow up in forests, and will always be 
dwelling in forest... [1-9-3b, 4]

[Commentary] Here the word used by Sumantra is tava putraagamam , it renders as 'the arrival 
of your sons', meaning that sons of King Dasharatha arrive from Heavens, but not through an 
ordinary parturition. Even earlier in time to that of Dasharatha, Sage Sanatkumara predicted 
the 'arrival' of Vishnu as Rama. The birth-event associated with Rishyasringa's name is that 
he is born with a horn on the crown of his head. Thus he is named as Rishyasringa, i.e., em> 
R^iSi the Sage; shR^i~Nga horn; a Sage with a horn on his forehead at his birth time. 
This being the mythological import, he is an acme among sages, as shR^i~Nga also 
means a peak.

Shlok 5: 



"Not knowing others, that Brahman the best, namely Rishyasringa, will always be abiding his 
father and he will follow celibacy of two kinds Brahmanical vows namely
vratitva , praajaapatya ...



Not knowing others that Brahman the best, will always be abiding his father, lest his renowned 
celibacy always praised by the Brahmans, will be hindered. [1-9-5]

[Commentary] The word dvaividhyam also means two kinds of celibacy, vratitva and 
prajaapatyam. One, as a bachelor and the other after marriage, voluntarily distancing 
away from his wife on certain forbidden days like full moon and new moon days, during daytime, 
eclipses, and other astronomical occurrences and some more. This kind of self-imposed celibacy 
is one way of observing sustained family planning methods, instead of resorting to medicaments. 
Here, this word is more nearer to mean 'hindrance', than to mean the 'two way celibacy' as 
deciphered by some commentators.

Shlok 6: "In the world he becomes famous for his celibacy, oh king, and he will always be praised by 
Brahmans, and thus time will pass on with that kind of his conduct. [1-9-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: Sage Rishyasringa looses no time with his servitor-ship to the Sacrificial Fire and also to 
his celebrated father, and during this period alone there will be a famed and very strong 
king Romapaada, a valiant in Anga country... [1-9-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: "But by a violation of righteousness of that king there will be a shocking and devastating 
famine in that country...[1-9-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "While the famine is besetting that king Roamapada will be afflicted with grim, and on summoning 
Brahmans and learned scholars he will address them... [1-9-9b. 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "All of you are well versed in rituals and knowers of the world history... order me how to 
how the purification from sin will be... [1-9-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: "Thus said by king those scholarly Brahmans and Vedic scholars will say to the king, 'oh, 
king, son of Sage Vibhaandaka, namely Rishyasringa, is to be fetched by all methods... [1-9-11b, 
12]

Shlok 13: "Oh! King, having brought Sage Rishyasringa and honouring him well with good care, procedurally 
give him your daughter Shanta in marriage to that Vedic Brahman and the son of Sage Vibhaandaka... 
[1-9-13]

Shlok 14: "On listening them the king becomes thoughtful about the idea by which it is possible to bring 
that self-controlled sage to his place... [1-9-14]

Shlok 15: "Then that intellectual king decides along with ministers, to dispatch clergymen and ministers, 
honouring them well, and then sends them... [1-9-15]

Shlok 16: "They on hearing king's words are awestruck and lowering their faces they will say, 'we can 
not go there as we are afraid of sage Vibhandaka, father of Rishyasringa...' [1-9-16]

Shlok 17: "After thinking over they will say as a second thought, and having found a solution with a 
plan to bring that sage, 'we will fetch that Brahman and also by that no stigma will occur...' 
[1-9-18]

Shlok 18: "Thus by the king of Anga kingdom and by his courtesans the son of sage Rishyasringa will 
be brought and the presiding deity for rains will shower rains, and Shanta will also be given 
in marriage to that sage...' [1-9-18]

Shlok 19: "Sage Rishyasringa, son-in-law of Romapaada, King of Anga ad as well as to you, if invited 
to our kingdom he will bless you to beget sons, oh! King... so said Sage Sanatkumaara to other 
sages and all this is retold by me." [Thus the charioteer and the Minister Sumantra completed 
his narration in confidence to King Dasharatha.] [1-9-19]

[Commentary] Sage Rishyasringa is also a son-in-law to King Dasharatha. Princess Shanta, in a distant relationship 
is a daughter to King Dasharatha in relation and the adopted daughter of Romapaada, the King 
of Anga. Thus Sumantra's saying son-in-law also means Dasharatha's son-in-law, besides Romapada's.

Shlok 20: Then King Dasharatha is delighted and in turn spoke to Sumantra "By what idea Rishyasringa 
is brought to Anga kingdom, that shall be said elaborately..." [1-9-20]



SARGA 10
------------------------------

[Text] Sumantra, the minister continues his narration to his king Dasharatha, about Rishyashringa's 
arrival at Anga kingdom of King Romapaada and his marriage with Princess Shantha, the daughter 
of Romapada.

Shlok 1: Sumantra thus motivated by King Dasharatha, said these words to king "Oh! King, how and with 
which idea Sage Rishyasringa is brought by the ministers of Romapada, all that will be spoken... 
that may please be listened from me along with ministers... [1-10-1]

Shlok 2: "The ministers along with clergyman have spoken this way to King Romapaada, "this is a non-harmful 
plan, well thought over by us..." [1-10-2]

Shlok 3: "Rishyasringa is a forest-dweller absorbed in ascesis and self-study of Vedic scriptures, 
and he is not aware of women, or of worldly-matters or of even worldly-pleasures...[1-10-3]

Shlok 4: "With much desired sense-pleasing objects that will be disquieting the minds of men, we wish 
bring him to the city... Let it be decided quickly... [1-10-4]

Shlok 5: "Beautiful and well decorated courtesans will go there to bring him hither by tempting with 
many a feint, and let the courtesans be given ample gifts... [1-10-5]

Shlok 6: "Hearing that the King replied the priest, "Let it be so..." and then the priests and ministers 
have carried out the plan that way... [1-10-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "On hearing that order of the king those best courtesans have entered that great forest, and 
they camped not very far from that hermitage, making all the trials for showing themselves 
off to a glance of that sage. [1-10-7]

[Commentary] Any dictionary would give the meaning of courtesan as 'whore' or as 'court mistress'. But 
in Indian context, the courtesan is not to be taken in such a lowly way as just a prostitute 
or a whore. They belong to a caste/class of artists. Juxtaposed to the Four-Caste system there 
was a devadasi Temple Dancers system, which is the artist's class. On their receiving 
enough education and skills in the performing arts and as per their capabilities, they will 
be nominated as Court Dancers or Temple Dancers and the like. Ancients recognized sixty-four 
arts chatuSSaSThi-kalaa , which include right from music, dance, and drama, sculpture, 
painting etc., up to the art of thievery. Kings in their political or sovereign pursuits variedly 
used these Deva Daasis, the courtesans.

Shlok 8b- 9: "Always satisfied is sage Rishyasringa to be in hermitage, thus he never stirred out of that 
hermitage, and thus he has not seen any female, or a male, or even any other objects of pleasure, 
either of city or of countryside from the time of birth onwards... [1-10-8b, 9]

[Commentary] Rishyasringa is thus not aware of gender differentiation or exposed to any other object of 
pleasure, and thus his father conditioned him to achieve some supreme ritual ideal.

Shlok 10: "Then at one time Rishyasringa casually arrived at that place, and has seen those comely females. 
[1-10-10]

Shlok 11: "They the lustful women are amazingly attired and singing melodious tunes, all of them neared 
the sage's son and spoke these words... [1-10-11]

Shlok 12: "Who you are? Why you move lonely in these deep and desolate forests, why you conduct yourself 
like this? Oh! Brahman, we are interested to know... please tell us..." [1-10-12]

Shlok 13: "Those women are in most desirable form and hitherto he has not seen such forms in that forest, 
hence a kind of friendship spouted, with which he is inclined to detail about his father... 
[1-10-13]

Shlok 14: "My father is Sage Vibhandaka and I am his true descent son. I am known as Rishyasringa, by 
my name and by an event on my birth, and thus renowned on earth..."

[Commentary] The birth-event associated with his name is that he is born with a horn on the crown of his 
head. Thus he is named as Rishyasringa, i.e., R^iSi= the Sage; sR^i~Nga= horn; a Sage with 
a horn, and this here he recalls his birth time event.

Shlok 15: "Our hermitage is here only, oh, august ones, I wish to perform scripturally worship to you 
all verily there..." thus said the sage to the courtesans. [1-10-15]

Shlok 16: "On hearing the words of sage's son, all those courtesans are verily inclined to see the threshold 
of that hermitage, then all the women went to hermitage. [1-10-16]

Shlok 17: "On going there, then the Sage's son performed worship saying "Here is our hand-wash, here 
is our feet-wash, here are our tuber fruits, here are the juicy fruits of ours... " [1-10-17]

[Commentary] This portrays the exclusion of the sage's son from the rest of the world by his father. He 
worshipped the courtesans, as he would worship some super-natural deities by saying the above 
words, which will usually be used in ritual worship of Hindu deities. He being a fruitarian 
has offered the courtesans the tuber fruits like sweet potatoes etc., which are ridiculous 
to urbanites, that too to the pleasure-taking courtesans.

Shlok 18: "All of them have received that kind of worship much enthusiastically, but dread at the arrival 
of the sage Vibhandaka, they quickly made-up their mind to make away from there. [1-10-18]

Shlok 19: " 'Take these important fruits of ours, oh, Brahman, you be safe, oh, holy one... eat them 
before long....' Said courtesans to Rishyasringa.] [1-10-19]

Shlok 20: "Then all of the courtesans have embraced him and all of them with a kind of mirthfulness 
in the offing, presented sweet-balls and other varieties of best sweetmeats to him. [1-10-20]

Shlok 21: "Having relished the sweets, that resplendent sage supposed them to be fruits only, for he 
did not taste sweets earlier, as he is always forest-bound. [1-10-21]

Shlok 22: "Taking leave of the Sage Rishyasringa on pretence that they also have to perform devotional 
duties, they the courtesans departed from there on the pretext of their daily worship, while 
they actually feared for the arrival of Rishyasringa's father who may hurl curses on his arrival... 
[1-10-22]

Shlok 23: "After the departure of all them the courtesans, that Brahman Rishyasringa, the grandson of 
Sage Kaashyapa, is disturbed at heart and even behaved sadly... [1-10-23]

Shlok 24- 25a: "Then on the next day Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka and the prosperous sage with ascetic 
power has arrived at that place where he saw well-decorated and delightful courtesans recollecting 
in mind repetitively about them alone. [1-10-24, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26: " Then on seeing the arrival of that Brahman, the courtesans felt happy at heart, and all 
of those courtesans on surrounding him said, "oh, gentle one, welcome to the threshold of 
our hermitage... [1-10-25b, 26]

Shlok 27: "There are excellent tuber fruits and fruits and there will be a very distinctive hospitality... 
definitely indeed..." So said the courtesans.[1-10-27]

Shlok 28: "On hearing the heart-pleasing words of all those courtesans, Rishyasringa made up his mind 
to go over there, and then those women took him away [to their place in Anga Kingdom.] [1-10-28]

Shlok 29: "While that great soul ad Brahman Rishyasringa while being brought into Anga Kingdom, then 
the Rain-god quickly showered rain in Anga kingdom to the delight of the world. [1-10-29]

Shlok 30- 31: "The king Romapada personally proceeded towards that Brahman Rishyasring who is now 
entering Anga kingdom along with rains, made prostratiion before him, offered water 
customarily with dedication, and then the king Romapada besought beneficence 
of the best sage Rishyasringa to save him and his kingdom from the fury of his father Sage Vibhandaka, 
if sage Vibhandaka were to know about this pursuit of bringing Rishyasringa to Anga 
country, at a later time ... [1-10-30, 31]

[Commentary] The salutation in prostration on the ground is usually performed before Gods or Deities, in 
reverence. It is called saaSTaanga-praNaamam = sa aSTa anga praNaamam , i.e., saluting 
with eight body parts touching the ground, indicating his absolute surrender to the worshipped.

Shlok 32: "On entering the palace princess Shanta is given to Rishyasringa in customary marriage, and 
then that King Romapada obtained rejoice with a peaceful mind. [1-10-32]

Shlok 33: " Thus that great fulgent Rishyasringa lived in Anga kingdom along with his wife Shanta, and 
with all his desires fulfilled and also well worshipped" [Thus Sumantra said the legend of 
Rishyasringa to King Dasharatha.] [1-10-33]



SARGA 11
------------------------------

[Text] On the advice of his minister Sumantra, Dasharatha proceeds to Anga kingdom to 
			fetch Sage Rishyasringa and his wife Shanta to his capital Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: Minister Sumantra continued, "oh, the great king, I will further narrate all that has been 
said by Sanat Kumara, the best one among all deities, kindly listen to these favourable words." 
[1-11-1.]

[Commentary] Sage Sanat Kumara belongs to the bygone era of Ikshvaku dynasty. Please refer to the account 
regarding the era-system of ancient India at endnote.

Shlok 2: "A king named Dasharatha will be born into Ikshwaku dynasty who will be very virtuous, 
resplendent and truthful one to his vow." [Said Sanat Kumara, the Sage.] [1-11-2]

Shlok 3: "King Dasharatha will befriend the king of Anga and the king of Anga will beget a fortunate 
girl named Shanta. [1-11-3]

[Commentary] Shanta is said to be the daughter of Dasharatha and given to Romapada in adoption, and Rishyasringa 
marries her alone. This is what Sumantra says to Dasharatha at 1-9-19.

Shlok 4: The son of the king of Anga, the earlier king of Anga kingdom, will be known as Romapada, 
or also know as Chitraratha, and the highly renowned king Dasharatha approaches Romapada. 
[1-11-4]

Shlok 5: Then king Dasharatha says to king of Anga "oh, righteous one, I am childless and hence I intend 
to perform a Vedic ritual. Let the husband of your daughter Shanta, Sage Rishyasringa, preside 
over that Vedic ritual at you behest, for the sake of progeny in my dynasty. [1-11-5]

Shlok 6: "On hearing those words of king Dasharatha that benevolent soul Romapada, the king of Anga, 
considers heartily and agrees to send the one who endows progeny by rituals, namely Sage Rishyasringa 
his son-in-law. [1-11-6]

[Commentary] The words pradaasyate putravantam are read in some translations as 'Rishyasringa 
who already has a son...' while others read it as 'a sage who endows progeny by putrakameSTi
 ritual...' But in Maha Bharata father Vibhandaka says to Rishyasringa to comeback 
after begetting a son, which Rishyasringa did not concede. So taking this some say Rishyasringa 
has a son. But it is generally accepted that putravantam as aahitaagni, 
Vedic ritualist of eminence, according to: jaataputraH kR^ishNakesho 
agniin adhiita... according to shruti scripture.

Shlok 7: "On receiving that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, at the behest of his father-in-law, that king 
Dasharatha gets rid of his febrile condition and will accomplish that Vedic ritual, feeling 
very felicitous in the depths of his heart. [1-11-7]

Shlok 8-9: "That king, the desirer of performing vedic ritual, the knower of virtue and the lord of people, namely Dasharatha 
will be requesting that best Brahman Rishyasringa with his palms adjoined in supplication 
for the conduct of ritual, for progeny and even for his heavenly abodes, and that king of 
all the quarters of earth will accomplish those desires from that eminent Brahman Rishyasringa. 
[1-11-8,9]

[Commentary] Heavenly abodes are dependent on begetting sons: aputrasya gatirnaasti 
svargo naiva ca naiva ca There is no way out [in other worlds] for those without sons...
shruti scripture. Hence the request of Dasharatha is that way.

Shlok 10: "There will be four sons to king Dasharatha that abound with valour, enrich dynasty's reputation 
and they will be renowned among all beings." Thus said Sage Sanat Kumara to other sages. [1-11-10]

[Commentary] 'Sons and Paradise are intimately connected in Indian belief. A man desires above every thing 
to have a son to perpetuate his race, and to assist with sacrifices and funeral rites to make 
him worthy to obtain a lofty seat in heaven or to preserve that which he has already obtained.' 
Gorresio via Ralph T. H. Griffith [1870-1874].

Shlok 11: "This way he that ancient and godly Sage Sanatkumaara, who is also Brahma's brain-child like 
Narada, said this legend in earlier Divine Era, called krita yuga..." thus Sumantra continued 
his narration to Dasharatha. [1-11-11]

[Commentary] Please refer endnote for yuga / era classification.

Shlok 12: " Oh, great king the tigerly-man, he that Sage Rishyasringa be led here on your proceeding 
in person with staff and transport and on adoring him well personally." Thus Sumantra concluded 
his narration. [1-11-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: On hearing the word of advise from charioteer, Dasharatha became gladsome and made Sumantra 
to reiterate to that sage also, for his approval, then Dasharatha travelled to the place where 
that Brahman Rishyasringa is, along with the inmates of palace-chambers and ministers too. 
[1-11-13, 14a]

[Commentary] While the chief priest Vashishta is officiator of all rituals no king can invite another priest 
to perform something without the consent of the officiating priest. Hence the consent of Vasishta 
is obtained, after asking Sumantra to reiterate what all was said, to sage Vashishta also.

Shlok 14b- 15a: On crossing over the rivers and forests slowly and steadily Dasharatha entered that kingdom 
where that eminent Brahman is there. [1-11-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Then Dasharatha saw that best Brahman who he is nearby king Romapada, and who is resplendent 
like ritual fire. [1-11-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then king Romapada gladdened at heart of hearts paid excellent respects to king Dasharatha 
procedurally and in view of their friendship.[1-11-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Then Romapada informed the wise sage Rishyasringa about the friendship and relation with Dasharatha, 
and then that sage worshipped king Dasharatha in his return. [1-11-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Thus well received by king Romapada, king Dasharatha spent seven to eight days with him, and 
then spoke this to king Romapada. [1-11-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Oh, lord of subjects, your daughter Princess Shanta may go over my city Ayodhya along with 
her husband Rishyasringa, as oh, king, I am contemplating to perform a great Vedic ritual, 
indeed." So said Dasharatha to Romapada. [1-11-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "So it shall be" said king Romapada agreeing to their travel with king Dasharatha, and addressed 
these words to that Brahman sage and his son-in-law, Sage Rishyasringa "You may proceed along 
with your wife." [1-11-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] Here Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation [1870-1874] has that Shanta is the daughter of Dasharatha: 
'This king,' he said, 'from days of old / A well beloved friend I hold. / To me this pearl 
of dames he gave / From childless woe mine age to save, / The daughter whom he loved so much, 
/ Moved by compassion's gentle touch. / In him thy S'anta's father see: / As I am even so 
is he...

Shlok 21b- 22a: Then Rishyasringa agreed and replied to the king Romapada "So it will be done" and then having 
been permitted by the king he set forth along with his wife. [1-11-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Those valiant kings greeted each other with thanksgiving palm-fold, and in friendship they 
embraced each other and gladdened. [1-11-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: Then king Dasharatha who set forth to Ayodhya bade farewell to his friend king Romapada, and 
he firstly sent quick-footed messengers to Ayodhya to inform his citizens about his arrival 
along with Sage Rishyasringa. [1-11-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "Let the entire city of Ayodhya be well decorated very quickly, let her streets be sprinkled 
with water and then swept, let the flags of welcome be hoisted.." Thus, king Dasharatha ordered 
messengers that are sent beforehand. [1-11-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: Then on hearing the arrival of their king all the citizens felt very happy and readily performed 
all those works exactly as ordered by their king. [1-11-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Then king Dasharatha keeping Rishyasringa before him entered the well-decorated city Ayodhya 
amidst the full sounding of conch shells and drumbeats. [1-11-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28: Then all the citizens are very happy on seeing that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, who is well 
honoured and being entered into the city by their king Dasharatha, as has been done once by 
Indra when he entered sage Kashyapa's son Vamana, the dwarfish boy and the incarnation of 
Vishnu, into heavens, and thus those citizens felt that their human lord Dasharatha vies with 
divine lord Indra. [1-11-27b, 28]

[Commentary] The simile of Indra to king Dasharatha is in two ways. Dasharatha ruled kingdom like Indra 
who rules Heavens. The word Indra karmaNa also refers to the deeds of Dasharatha, 
in helping the gods' forces combating the demonic forces. Thus the deeds performed by Dasharatha 
are like those of Indra's. Here Dasharatha is bringing Sage Rishyasringa to Ayodhya. Earlier 
Indra led Vamana, the dwarf-boy to heavens. Vamana is the incarnation of Vishnu in early ages 
and after Vamana suppressed Bali, the Emperor to netherworlds, Indra took Vamana to heavens. 
Thus Dasharatha is like Indra on earth, both by his virtue and deed. Incidentally, Vamana 
i.e., Vishnu, is the son-incarnate to Sage Kaashyapa, while sage Rishyasringa is the grandson 
of the same Kaashyapa. Thus Sage Kaashyapa is instrumental to these two incarnations. Through 
the divine grace of Sage Rishyasringa, the same Vishnu is going to take birth as Rama, while 
Sage Kashyapa is a grandparent of Rama in this era, and while he alone was Vishnu's father 
when Vishnu incarnated as Dwarf boy Vamana.

Shlok 29: Dasharatha entered the sage into the palace chambers and worshipped him there as ordained 
in the scriptures, and in bringing the Sage here into his country, king Dasharatha believed 
that his desired is fulfilled. [1-11-28]

Shlok 30: On seeing her, the broad-eyed Shanta, who came there along with her husband all the ladies 
of palace derived happiness for the homecoming of their own daughter, as it were. [1-11-29]

Shlok 31: Shanta thus being admired by all of them, and in an exceptional manner by Dasharatha, comfortably 
resided there along with her husband, the Vedic scholar Rishyasringa. [1-11-31]

[Commentary] The Riwik is not just a reciter of Veda-s but more a director or conductor of whole orchestration 
of the Vedic ritual, which involves lots of rules, in reciting hymns, in performing deeds 
and all in their exactness. The whole lots of works that need be performed have the order 
of precedence like prime, auxiliary or adjunctive in their ordinance. A Ritwik is the elated 
scholar who keeps track of these activities while other scholars recite hymns as directed 
by these Ritwik-s. Hence, Ritwik-hood is the highest.

[Commentary] One cycle of the above four eras is called one 
mahaa yuga and seventy-one [71] of such of the Fourfold Eras mahaa yugaa-s will become 
one manvantara, Manu-Epoch, the time scale attributed to one Manu, the Supreme Ruler of 
Mankind. There are total fourteen such Manu-epochs and six of them over in the present 
manvantara , the time-scale.

[Commentary] The completed Manu cycles are 1.] 
svayambhu manu , 2.] svaarochiSa manu , 3.] auttami manu , 4.] taamasa 
manu , 5.] raivata manu , 6.] chaaksha manu . Presently we are in the Seventh 
cycle called vaivasvata mnavantara , and there are seven more manvantara -s to 
come, starting with 8.] surya saavarni Manu, 9.] dharma saavarni, 10.] daksha 
savarni, 11.] rudra saavarni, 12.] brahma saavrani, 13.] rouchya manu 
, 14.] bhoutya manu.

[Commentary] Such fourteen Manu time cycles will be said to 
be a Day of Brahma, the Absolute. Ramayana is said to have happened in kR^ita yuga, the 
second Manu time cycle. The earlier one is satya yuga , in which the ancestors of Rama, 
descendants of Raghu dynasty, like Saagara, Harishchandra et al, were the rulers, which is called 
Ikshvaku dynasty.

King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the sages indent paraphernalia, 
which the ministers are ordered to supply forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 
8, excepting the inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha desired to perform the Vedic 
ritual. [1-12-1]

[Commentary] Please refer to endnote for Indian seasons and months for vasanta / spring season.

Shlok 2: Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is like that of a deity, King 
Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny 
to maintaining his family line. [1-12-2]

Shlok 3: Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to the king, "So it shall be, let the 
paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative and 
let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." [1-12-3]

Shlok 4- 5- 6a: Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, "Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors 
like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well 
as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly..." [1-12-4, 5, 6a]

Shlok 6- 7- 8a: Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic scholars and clergymen. 
Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due worships to all the sages and saints brought in 
by Sumantra, uttered these words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner. [1-12-6, 
7, 8a]

Shlok 8- 9- 10a: "My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am thinking of performing the 
Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by 
strict observances... I wish to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage's 
son, Rishyasringa... [1-12-8, 9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: Then "Splendid, splendid is this idea," said the Brahmana scholars blessing the king. Then Sage Vashishta 
along with all other important personalities have applauded the idea that has come out of the king's 
voice, and all those Vedic scholars and clerj~nmen keeping Rishyasringa at helm of affairs said this 
to the king, in appreciation of that idea. [1-12-10b, 11]

Shlok 12- 13: "Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come to you, you will by all 
means get four sons with boundless valour... let ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse 
be released and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
The Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. [1-12-12, 13]

Shlok 14: Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, and he spoke to the other 
ministers of his court, with happiness derived from those good words. [1-12-14]

Shlok 15-16-17-18- 19: The king said to his executives, "As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the paraphernalia for my ritual 
be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let 
religious teachers follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the northern 
banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and prospering throughout as ordained 
in the scriptures and tradition... all the kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, 
if only they can perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult ritual... the 
Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the rituals whereat they can inteject themselves 
in to the proceedings of the ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also 
gets ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be conducted faultlessly 
till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the scriptures... since all of you assembled here 
are efficient ones in conducting such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... 
[1-12-15,16,17,18, 19]

Shlok 20: In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying "it will be done accordingly..." 
and indeed they have faultlessly carried out works as ordered. [1-12-20]

Shlok 21: Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is like a Sacred Bull among the kings for 
his virtuous endeavour of undertaking the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned 
from there as they have come. [1-12-21]

Shlok 22: On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those ministers who are still available 
there for further orders from the king, and then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. 
[1-12-22]



The Indian yearly time-cycle is two-kind, one on northern solstice and the other southern solstice. 
And seasons are twelve and every two months is a season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing 
on the stars position every year. They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below:



SARGA 13
------------------------------



King Dasharatha requests Sage Vashishta, the Royal Priest to commence works for the Vedic 
ritual. Sage Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline to be observed in 
executing the works. Sage Vashishta also instructs the minister Sumantra to invite various 
kings of other countries, and those kings will be received with great hospitality. King Dasharatha 
along with his wives takes ritual vow and enters ritual hall.

Shlok 1: On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined 
one to beget progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall. [1-13-1]

[Commentary] The performer of such Vedic rituals has to perform preliminary rituals for a period of one 
year in order to attain eligibility to perform the final one. Here Dasharatha is said to have 
completed such preludes as he entering into the Vedic ritual hall in the springtime of the 
succeeding year to the one referred in last chapter.

Shlok 2: Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble 
words to him. [1-13-2]

Shlok 3: "Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such 
a way that no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions. [1-13-3]

Shlok 4: "You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly and kind-hearted to me, and you alone 
shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good faith and credence. [1-13-4]

Shlok 5: Then that reverent Brahman Vashishta said to king, "Whatever that is requested or decided 
by you, I will see that all of them are materialised accordingly. [1-13-5]

Shlok 6-7-8-9: Then Sage Vashishta then summoned and spoke to elderly Brahman scholars, and elderly architects 
who are all proficient and elderly experts in conducting the construction of the ritual hall 
etc. Then summoned are the construction supervisors, brick-makers, carpenters, earth-diggers, 
accountants, and sculptors. So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars 
in scriptures and those men who are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them 
saying, "Performance of the ritual be organised by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands 
be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, 
with very many facilities included in them. [1-13-6,7,8,9]

[Commentary] A detailed description of the components of Vedic ritual hall is given at the endnote of next 
chapter, wherein King Dasharatha enters. Vedic ritual cannot be performed in ordinary households 
or in small temples. A very large place is selected, as per architectural science, and at 
its centre a homa-kunda, an altar of fire will be constructed. This area will not 
have any roofing so as to let the vapours of oblations of ghee, sandalwood paste and others 
offered into the fire of altar, get into the atmosphere and thereby to Heavens. Around this 
altar of fire, huge sheds will be constructed to accommodate thousands of participants and 
onlookers. Apart from this, mammoth kitchens and dining halls are to be constructed as all 
of the thousands of participants, who are to be fed as long as ritual is conducted. Some of 
the many tradesmen are listed in a bird's eye view as above.

Shlok 10: "Like that, for accommodating Brahmans hundreds of sanctified houses be built, well endowed 
and well established with very many eatables, foods, and potables. [1-13-10]

Shlok 11: "So also, accommodation is to be given for city dwellers too, in very spacious housing, and 
severally for the kings arriving from distant places.[1-13-11]

Shlok 12: "For horses stables, reposing stalls for elephants, like that great billets for soldiers may 
be built for those foreign-country dwellers arriving in here on their horses and elephants 
along with their soldiers. [1-13-12]

Shlok 13: "These lodgings are to be arranged with many foods and utilities for the people of this city 
and for others coming from distant countries, and a very grand food be given in all of them. 
[1-13-13]

Shlok 14- 15a: "Food is to be given dutifully treating all of them well but not just illusively, and the 
people of all the castes shall be well honoured as they would get their due respect, and no 
disrespect be shown, even when overcome by passion or anger at anyone. [1-13-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16: "Exceptionally respectable are those men and architects that are preoccupied in the works 
of the ritual as they deserve, and those men involved in these works shall be well-treated 
with funds and food. [1-13-15b, 16]

Shlok 17: "Thus, as to how all this be well organised without least negligence, thus you all shall administer 
in all your cooperation and good spirit." Thus Sage Vashishta spoke to the organisers. [1-13-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: Then all of them collectively replied to Sage Vashishta "As desired, all the well ordered 
works will not be neglected in the least, and they will be done as ordered, and not the least 
of them will be slighted." So said the artisans to Sage Vashishta. [1-13-18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20- 21a: "Then on calling for Sumantra, Sage Vashishta said these words to him, "Let all those kings 
of the earth that are righteous be invited, and let all the people from all the kingdoms, 
say Brahmans, Kshatriya-s, Vaisya-s, Shudra-s be invited in scores duly honouring them." So 
said Vashishta to Sumantra. [1-13-19b, 20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: "You personally invite Janaka the king of Mithila, a valiant one and an advocate of truth, 
honouring his well and duly bearing in mind that he is a long-time associate of our King Dasharatha, 
hence I am telling you in the first instance. [1-13-21b,22]

Shlok 23: "Thus that King of Kaashi who is always a friendly, affectionate and a cordial one, indeed 
he shall be invited by you personally. [1-13-23]

Shlok 24: "Likewise, King of Kekaya, an elderly, very virtuous, and also the father-in-law of our Lion-King 
Dasharatha, you personally invite him along with his sons. [1-13-24]

Shlok 25: "Romapada, the lord of Anga kingdom and the user of great bow, let that illustrious one be 
invited well honoured, for he is the friend of our lion-king Dasharatha. [1-13-25]

Shlok 26: "Like that King of Kosala namely Bhanumanta, and the King of Magadha, a brave one and a profound 
one in all scriptural knowledge, let them be honoured well and be invited. [1-13-26]

Shlok 27: "And Praaptijna, the king of Magadha, the kind-hearted and best one among kings, be well honoured 
and invited. Further, taking the orders of King Dasharatha and motivated by those orders, 
the kings of Sindhu, Sauviira and Sauraastra kingdoms may also be invited. [1-13-27]

Shlok 28- 29: "All of the kings of southern kingdoms be invited, and should there be any other friends and 
other friendly kings on the surface of the earth, they too shall be invited as early as possible 
with all their followers, relatives through highly illustrious envoys, of course with the 
orders of our king." Thus Sage Vashishta said to minister Sumantra. [1-13-28, 29]

Shlok 30: On hearing that word of Vashishta, Sumantra expeditiously ordered devout envoys to invite 
all those kings to their kingdom. [1-13-30]

Shlok 31: That virtuous Sumantra became brisk upon sage's words and personally journeyed to fetch all 
the rulers on the earth. [1-13-31]

Shlok 32: All those artisans engaged in ritual works have reported Vashishta, the details of all those 
ritual works that are accomplished. [1-13-32]

Shlok 33- 34a: Then, that satisfied saint and eminent Brahman Vashishta, spoke this way to all of them, "nothing 
is to be endowed to anyone either with disrespect or deceptively, the deeds done with disrespect 
will kill the donor and there is no doubt about it." [1-13-33, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: Then in some days and nights many kings have arrived taking precious gems with them as gifts 
for Dasharatha. [1-13-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b- 36: Then the well pleased Sage Vashishta said this to King Dasharatha "the kings from distant 
kingdoms have arrived at your behest, oh, tigerly-man, and these best kings are well honoured 
by me also as per their status. [1-13-35b, 36]

Shlok 37: "All the ritual works are also completed by the well coalescent men, thus you may start towards 
the ritual place that is nearby, to perform your ritual." Said Sage Vashishta to King Dasharatha. 
[1-13-37]

Shlok 38: "All the desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt 
of you see ritual hall that is as though built by your mere wish. [1-13-38]

Shlok 39: Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth 
towards the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa. 
[1-13-39]

[Commentary] In undertaking of auspicious works, Hindus watch out for date, day, and the star of the day, 
called tithi, vaara, nakshatra in accordance with astrological import. In addition 
to these three are two more yoga and karaNa , which when added together 
this becomes panchaanga, five-aspects of time, which are essential to verify before 
conducting any auspicious work.

Shlok 40: Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them 
entered the ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus. [1-13-40]

Shlok 41: When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha 
along with his wives undertook vow of ritual. [1-13-41]



SARGA 14
------------------------------



The Horse Ritual of Emperor Dasharatha is started on the banks of Sarayu River. The details 
of the arrangements for the participants, and visitors along with some aspects of the Vedic 
Ritual are narrated.

Shlok 1: Then after completion of one year and on regaining the ritual horse, the Emperor Dasharatha 
commenced his Vedic Ritual on the northern banks of River Sarayu. [1-14-1]

[Commentary] In ashwamedha-yaga , a well-decorated horse will be let out with an insignia on its 
forehead challenging any king to capture it and face the wrath of releasing king. If any one 
captures the horse, he shall be strong enough to incite a war. Otherwise, the valour and invincibility 
of releasing king are well established and he may proceed with the ritual proper. Now that 
the ritual horse released during last year by King Dasharatha has come back without being 
captured by anyone, thus establishing the invincibility of King Dasharatha, as such he can 
commence the ritual proper.

Shlok 2: Keeping Rishyasringa at the helm of affairs those eminent Brahmans commenced, ashva-medha 
, the Horse-ritual of that noble-souled Dasharatha. [1-14-2]

Shlok 3: Those well-versed conductors of Vedic rituals called ritviks , have started to perform 
works relating to ritual as per canon and rules, and conducted them scripturally and customarily. 
[1-14-3]

Shlok 4: On performing pravargya ritual as per scriptures, like that upasada ritual 
too, those Brahmans have customarily performed all of those other rituals incidental to the 
main one scripturally. [1-14-4]

Shlok 5: Then all of those distinguished sages are contended with what they have performed by worshipping 
gods already summoned, they also conducted early morning savana ritual and its ancillaries 
as enjoined. [1-14-5]

Shlok 6: The oblations addressed to Indra are well given as ordained, and the flawless king Dasharatha 
also crushed the Soma creeper to squeeze Soma juice, and thus the mid-day savana 
ritual has come to pass according to sequence. [1-14-6]

[Commentary] Soma creeper is from Sacrostemma Brevistigma of Asclepiadacea family and some other scholars 
hold the view that it is from Sarcostema Viminalis family.

Shlok 7: Like that those proficient Brahmans have also performed the third savana , ritual 
of that great-exalted soul Dasharatha according to the viewpoint of scriptures. [1-14-7]

Shlok 8: Rishyasringa and other best scholars with their well lettered and intonated Vedic hymns have 
invoked Indra and other gods to that place. [1-14-8]

Shlok 9: The hotaa -s, invocators, have welcomed the celestials for partaking oblations by 
singing saama Veda hymns sweetly and harmoniously, and on inviting them with Vedic 
hymns they have offered oblations to them. [1-14-9]

Shlok 10: There is no unburnt oblation resulted in that fire-ritual nor even a small mishap slipped 
in the performance of ritual. Everything appeared canonically correct and hymn oriented. Indeed 
the ritual is performed in a secure way. [1-14-10]

Shlok 11: In these days of ritual none found there to be weary or hungry, and there is no single unscholarly 
person, nor any Brahman without at least a hundred apprentices. [1-14-11]

Shlok 12: Given anytime the Brahmans, servants, sages, and pilgrims are fed with food for their arrival 
at the place of boarding is unpredictable, and that arrival is dependent on their duties for 
Brahmans, and by their masters for servants, and for pilgrims that do not have a particular 
time of arrival or departure. [1-14-12]

[Commentary] Some scholars tend to conclude that Ramayana might have been written in post Buddhist period 
by finding the words like shramaNa etc., the famous wandering Buddhist monk sect. 
The word shramaNa in Sanskrit means only a pilgrim, and pilgrimage is an ordained 
aspect of salvation as per Indra is the friend of traveller. Therefore wander - aitareya 
brahmaNa [VII.33.3] The Buddhist shramaNa -s are the wandering monks in search 
of converts whereas Hindu shramana-s are pure sanyasi-s wandering for their 
own salvation.

Shlok 13: Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, no satisfaction 
to complete the meal is attained for themselves, as the food served is that pleasant.



Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, there is no satisfaction 
to Emperor Dasharatha, for it appeared to be too meagre a serving and a lot more is to be 
served. [1-14-13]

Shlok 14: "Food be given abundantly, clothing be given variously" are the directives, accordingly the 
king's men have distributed numerously there at the ritual place. [1-14-14]

Shlok 15: Heaps of foodstuffs are also appearing there, many of them and mountain similar, which is 
made available customarily, day after day. [1-14-15]

Shlok 16: To that ritual of that great-souled Dasharatha masses of men and women have arrived from different 
countries, and they are all well-pleased with the sumptuous food and drink supplied. [1-14-16]

Shlok 17: "The eminent Brahmans have appreciated the food that is prepared by perfect cooking to be 
relishable, and it is heard as they said, "oh, Raghava, blessed are you for we are satisfied..." 
[1-14-17]

Shlok 18: Well-decorated men have served food to Brahmans, while others who wore gem-studded and lustrous 
earrings have helped them. [1-14-18]

Shlok 19: Those eminent Brahmans that are good debaters have debated many intellectual debates to defeat 
each other, during the gap-periods of ritual works. [1-14-19]

Shlok 20: Day by day those expert Brahmans have performed all ritual works as encouraged by Vashishta, 
and others and as contained in scriptures. [1-14-20]

Shlok 21: There is no scholar without the knowledge of the six branches of Vedas, none who is an unavowed 
scholar, none who heard learnt less scriptures, and none among the members of the ritual of 
that king Dasharatha is an inexpert in debating, thus all are scholarly Brahmans. [1-14-21]

[Commentary] The six branches of Veda-s are: 1] shikSaa - phonetics, 2] vyaakaraNa - grammar, 
3] chandas - prosody, 4] nirukta - etymology, 5] jyoutiSha - astronomy, 
6] kalpa - ritual acts.

Shlok 22-23: When the time came to stake wooden ritual posts, six posts of bilwa wood, six posts of khadira 
wood, and further the same number of posts of parnina wood are staked. One post of sleshmaataka 
wood and two of devadaaru wood as stipulated are staked. Then the distance between each post 
is maintained at the length of extended arms. [1-14-22,23]

Shlok 24: All of those the posts are made by the authorities on scriptures and ritual scholars, and 
they are gold-pleated and decorated for the purpose of elegance to that ritual. [1-14-24]

Shlok 25: They are altogether twenty-one posts, each post is twenty-one cubits in height, and each is 
decoratively clothed with each cloth. [1-14-25]

Shlok 26: Carpenters have carved all the posts well, and built them strongly with octahedral surfaces 
that are smoothened, and thereby they are implanted procedurally. [1-14-26]

Shlok 27: Those posts draped in cloths and worshipped with flowers and perfumery are irradiant, and 
they shone forth like the constellation of Seven Sages in the sky. [1-14-27]

[Commentary] The Seven Sages is the constellation of stars in the Ursa Major - The Great Bear, and is called
sapta R^ishimaNDala . The Indian names of the Seven Sages are 1] atri , 
2] angiirasa , 3] pulastya , 4] pulaha , 5] kratu , 6]
mariichi , 7] vashiSTha .

Shlok 28: The bricks for Altar of Fire are well designed and made according to rules and standard measurements. 
The Brahmans who are experts in the architecture of laying Fire Altar, by calculating the 
ritual field with a one-ply rope and decide where and how the that shall be, the Altar of 
Fire is layered well with bricks in that ritual. [1-14-28]

[Commentary] The construction of Fire Altar itself is a ritual, called iSTikaa-chayana , where 
each brick is to be consecrated with hymns. On completion of the layering of bricks to the 
required shape, i.e., that of an eagle-like platform for a garuDayaj~na-vedi etc., 
then Holy head bath abhiSeka is performed to the brick-work of the Altar by pouring 
milk and other sacred liquids to the chanting of Vedic hymns.

Shlok 29: That Altar of Fire of that King, the Lion, is layered by expert Brahmans in the shape of an 
eagle with golden wings, with its size being three folds bigger than the altars of other rituals, 
thus it has eighteen separators, and fire is laid on it. [1-14-29]

[Commentary] The garuDa , the Divine Eagle is the vehicle of Vishnu with an all-pervading vision 
and fastest wings. He is the only one who once brought amrita, the Divine Elixir, for the 
release of his mother from slavery. Hence, the Altar of Fire is given the shape of this Divine 
Eagle, with its wings and tail outstretched, head turned downward, and the eyes looking eastward.
yaj~na is also termed as suparNa i.e., su good, parNa 
winged; carrier of the oblations with his golden wings to heavens. Or its wings are glittering 
with gold sahasram hiraNyashakalaiH pratidinam agnim prokShati - shruti 
meaning every day with thousands of gold chips oblate the fire... scriptures say 
so. So the Altar of fire is glittering with thousands of gold chips sprinkled every day. This 
altar is laid threefold bigger than the usual one.

Shlok 30: In that ritual animals, serpents and birds designated to such and such deities are readied 
according to the scriptural directives. [1-14-30]

Shlok 31: The sages have arranged those animals that are to be there in animal sacrifices, like horse 
and other aquatic animals, in that ritual according to scriptures. [1-14-31]

[Commentary] Many animals are sacrificed in Horse ritual. But they will be segregated as forest animals 
and village animals. In them many of the forest animals will be let off by taking them round 
the fire on to their right in salutation to fire, agnipradakShiNa-namaskaara. The 
animals pertaining to village will be sacrificed in ritual. Hence it is up to the priests 
to decide which is to be retained or let off.

Shlok 32: Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse 
of that King Dasharatha. [1-14-32]

Shlok 33: With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, 
and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. [1-14-33]

[Commentary] Here Kausalya did not butcher the horse as queens do not butcher animals in rituals, but the 
horse is already sacrificed. It is a symbolical act of queens to pierce with three golden 
knives like needles. The scripture says that all the eligible wives of the performer of ritual 
have to pierce that way. sauvarNiibhi suuciibhiH patnayaH ashvasya asipathaan 
kalayanti - shruti / scripture. So all the three queens have performed that symbolic 
act by piercing that horse, which is already dead, with golden needle-like knives. Govindaraja.

Shlok 34: Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse 
that flew away like a bird. [1-14-34]

Shlok 35: Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely hotaa adhwaryu and udgaataa 
have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the 
king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king. [1-14-35]

[Commentary] There will be four officiating priests for these Vedic rituals. 1. brahmaa , 2.
hotaa , 3. adhvaryu , 4. udgaataa , to whom the king has to donate 
his inner core properties like wives, lands etc. By practice a king has to marry four wives. 
The four women of the king are 1. mahiSi = Queen, 2. parivR^itti = neglected 
women, 3. vaavaata = concubine, 4. paalaakali = goblet-maid. The order of 
donation is that the Queen to brahmaa , concubine to hotaa , neglected woman 
to udgaataa , and the goblet-maid to the adhwaryu . Here, though the 
brahma ritvik is not cited along with paalaakali, goblet-maid, they are implied. 
The donation is symbolic and later bartering with some valuable items that is redeemed. Govindaraja. 
There is another way of translating this. For the wording, hastena samayojayan the 
priests took these wives by hand to bring them in contact with the dead horse.

Shlok 36: Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum 
[fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to 
bake as a food to the celestials. [1-14-36]

[Commentary] Some more scholars give a non-violent touch to this act and they say that a medicinal plant 
,is offered in altar and its smell is smelt. That plant is substituted for omentum of the 
horse, and the wording is read differently. When the sequence is running on horse and horse's 
body parts how a medical plant is brought in, is unclear. And some say that a horse will not 
have omentum according to Vedic texts.

Shlok 37: The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own 
sin. [1-14-37]

Shlok 38: Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally 
oblated all of them into fire. [1-14-38]

Shlok 39: In other rituals the oblations will be offered into sacrificial fire with spoon-like sticks 
of plaksha tree, but in Horse-sacrifice ritual they are offered through the vetasa creeper, 
a rattan plant, cane. [1-14-39]

Shlok 40: The Horse Ritual is to be performed for three days as laid down in kalpasutra-s, 
the rules governing such rituals, and by braahmaNa-s, the penultimate parts of Veda-s, 
and the one performed on the first day is called chatuSToma ritual. [1-14-40]

Shlok 41: The ritual on the second day is called ukthyam , and the next one performed on third 
day is called atiraatra. These apart many of the preordained rituals are performed 
there in that ritual as envisaged in scriptures. [1-14-41]

[Commentary] The horse-ritual is conducted only for three days. But Dasharatha got it performed with more 
variously connected rituals, in all his eagerness to appease gods for progeny.

Shlok 42: The rituals called jyothiSToma, aayuSi, and atiraatra rituals are performed. 
And also rituals of great kind like abhijit, vishwajit, aptoryaama are performed. 
[1-14-42]

Shlok 43-44: As the promoter of his own dynasty that king Dasharatha donated eastern side to hotaa, 
western to adhvaryu, and southern to brahmaa. And to udgaataa northern 
side is given in donation. These were the donations stipulated in that great ritual, ashwamedha, 
by the Self-Created Brahma from earlier times. [1-14-44,43]

Shlok 45: On completing the ritual thus that best man Dasharatha justifiably donated those lands to 
the officiating priests, called ritwiks, to promote his dynasty. [1-14-45]

Shlok 46: Thus on giving away the vast expanses of his kingdom he that glorious one born in Ikshvaku 
dynasty is gladdened, but all the officiating priests said to the king who by now is rid of 
his sins. [1-14-46]

Shlok 47: "You alone are capable to protect the earth in its entirety, and there is no use for us with 
these lands, and we are not capable to rule it, either." Thus the priests are addressing the 
king. [1-14-47]

Shlok 48: "We are always preoccupied with self-study and teaching of scriptures, oh, king, thus you 
may give us something else in barter, any modest thing. " [1-14-48]

Shlok 49: "Let best gems, gold, or cows or anything else that is available you may give us, what is 
the use of these vast expanses to us." So said the scholars. [1-14-49]

Shlok 50- 51a: The king Dasharatha, the lord of people, thus requested by the scholarly Vedic Brahmans gave 
them millions of cows, ten of ten million gold coins, and the silver four times thereof. [1-14-50, 
51a]

[Commentary] Silver is prohibited for donation in such rituals, but here it is being given as barter for 
the lands earlier donated, hence it is an acceptable item.

Shlok 51b- 52a: Then all those officiating priests collectively gave that wealth to sage Rishyasringa and 
to the enlightened sage Vashishta. [1-14-51b, 52a]

Shlok 52b- 53a: Then all of those Brahmans are well satisfied at heart and distributed among themselves the 
wealth passed on by Rishyasringa and Vashishta, and then they said, "We are highly gladdened." 
[1-14-52a, 53a]

Shlok 53b- 54a: Then to the other Brahmans who arrived there to see the ritual, King Dasharatha sincerly donated 
ten million gold coins. [1-14-53b, 54a]

Shlok 54b- 55a: That descendent of Raghava dynasty gave an excellent hand ornament to someone who is an impoverished 
Brahman and who is beseeching. [1-14-54a, 55a]

Shlok 55b- 56a: While those Brahmans are becoming happy then that king and the patron of Brahmans venerated 
them dutifully with his senses fluttering with happiness. [1-14-55b, 56a]

Shlok 56b- 57a: Then that benevolent and valiant King Dasharatha prostrated on ground venerating the Brahmans, 
and the Brahmans too chanted various blessing hymns on that prostrating king. [1-14-56b, 57a]

[Commentary] The blessings are also Vedic hymns and particular parts of Vedic hymns are chanted for particular 
occasion called aashiirwachana hymns. To date this practice is continued where a 
Brahmin priest is commissioned to perform even a domestic ritual. In effect, it shall be construed 
that these are not the blessings of the Brahmin priests who are chanting, but it is the blessing 
of Veda itself.

Shlok 57b- 58a: Then that king is gladdened at heart for the successful achievement of the completion of that 
excellent ritual that removes sin and that leads to heaven as well, and that which cannot 
be undertaken by many of the best kings. [1-14-57b, 58a]

Shlok 58b- 59a: Thereafter king Dasharatha said to sage Rishyasringa thus, "oh, sage with best vows, you alone 
are eligible to perform the ritual for the expansion of my dynasty." [1-14-58b, 59a]

Shlok 59b: That best Brahman Rishyasringa saying yes to the proposal, said this to king Dasharatha, "oh, 
king, there will be four sons to you that ennoble your dynasty. [1-14-59b, c]

Shlok 60: On hearing the sweet words of Sage Rishyasringa, he that king of kings Dasharatha went into 
a state of ecstasy and venerating that great soul, Rishyasringa, again said this to him. [1-14-60]



SARGA 15
------------------------------



King Dasharatha commences the putrakaameSTi ritual aiming to beget progeny, under 
the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings gather to receive the oblations offered 
in the Horse Ritual conducted by King Dasharatha. They are perturbed at the atrocities of 
Ravana, and request Brahma to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu arrives there and 
pacifies Brahma and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate as human to 
eliminate Ravana.

Shlok 1: That intellectual sage and one proficient in Veda-s Rishyasringa contemplated for a while, 
and gaining indications as to which ritual is to be performed, then said the king. [1-15-1]

Shlok 2: "I will procedurally conduct the ritual contained in the preamble of atharva-veda 
with procedural hymns, called <<em>>putra kaameSTi i.e., the ritual that bestows sons, for 
your benefit." [1-15-2]

Shlok 3: Then that resplendent Sage Rishyasringa commenced that putrakaameSTi ritual, offering 
oblations into sacred fire with ritual acts meticulously contained in hymns. [1-15-3]

Shlok 4: Then the deities along with celestial beings, siddha-s, i.e., the souls that obtained salvation, 
and also other esteemed sages who by now are the residents of Heavens have duteously assembled 
in the firmament to receive their part of the oblations. [1-15-4]

[Commentary] These celestial beings having attained salvation and living in their heavenly abodes do not 
re-enter these mortal worlds. They assemble in their cosmic zone, up above the Fire Altar 
of the Vedic ritual whenever a yajna is conducted on earth, to receive oblations.

Shlok 5: Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, 
the creator of worlds. [1-15-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh! God, the demon named Ravana is torturing all of us with his intrepidity, as you have 
blessed him, and we are unable to control him. [1-15-6]

Shlok 7: "You have given boon to him appreciating his ascesis and oh, god, with high regard to that 
boon of yours we are tolerating all the cruel acts of Ravana from then onwards [1-15-7]

[Commentary] Hindu mythology has no devils, but has only raakshasa -s, who can hardly be called 
demons, either. Not all the raakshasa-s are evil-doers. Some of the raakshasa-s are the fallen 
angels who take birth as mortals. They have their Vedic education, and they perform Vedic 
rituals and penance etc., thereby they get the patronage of any one of the gods among the 
Hindu Trinity, viz., Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. On attaining the cherished boons, they suddenly 
revolt against their own patron deities and commence the atrocities only to conquer the Heavens, 
knowing well that they cannot be attained with a mortal body. In order to snub the upsurge 
of such violence or the unnatural ascension to Heaven, the deity who gave the boons seeks 
the help of any of the other two of the Trinity. Then one from the Trinity will take birth 
as mortal, as an incarnation of god on earth. Usually Vishnu incarnates himself to eradicate 
the evils created by the intrepid raakshasa-s.

[Commentary] Here the celestials bring in a preamble for Vishnu's incarnation as Rama and thus the topic 
of Ravana occurs in this chapter of Ramayana. Ravana need not be taken as an evil spirit, 
devil, hobgoblin or a monstrous being. He is said to be a Brahman well versed in all Vedas, 
musicologist, and a great king of Lanka, with unlimited riches, and very many of his clansmen 
with their vast dominions, and what not. Though Brahma and Shiva bless Ravana with boons, 
Ravana flouts all the norms in conquering Heavens in which course he did not hesitate to torture 
anyone who becomes his personal hurdle or hindrance. Hence it is inevitable for the Trinity 
to curb Ravana's atrocities, and Vishnu will now be requested by all the deities to incarnate 
himself on earth. As such, the expression of the word "DEMON" may not always be taken as an 
ugly and monstrous looking devil or Satan, as per the usual religious conceptualisation of 
evil.

[Commentary] In Hinduism evil is not a separate entity from humans, but available in the same personification 
and resides along with virtue, like the two sides of a coin. These raakshasa-s are also mortals, 
extraordinary beings with extraordinary powers like god incarnates. But, with wickedness in 
their will, monstrosity in mind and a conqueror's ambition in their heart, they are rendered 
themselves as demons.

Shlok 8: "That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities 
of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of 
universe. [1-15-8]

[Commentary] There are eight functionary gods for cosmos in Hindu mythology that keep the cycle of natural 
law going. Each one is assigned with each of the eight sides of the universe along with a 
natural function. They are: 1] Indra, Heaven : East, 2] agni Fire-god : 
southeast, 3] yama Death-god : South, 4] naiR^iti Demon-god : southwest, 
5] varuNa Rain-god : west, 6] vaayu Air-god : Northwest, 7] kubera 
god of wealth management : North, 8] iishaana god of bliss : Northeast. The governance 
of all these deities is Indra's function, since he is the presiding deity of Heaven.

Shlok 9: "That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly 
torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even 
the Brahmans. [1-15-9]

[Commentary] The sura and a-sura nomenclature is the one that is commonly found in Vedic 
literature. sura is a celestial being and asura is its antonym, usually 
referred as a demon. Here it is not so because there are many asura-s who made their 
abode in heaven, like Rahu, Ketu, and others who attain salvation in this mortal life. Even 
Ravana came from Heaven, and returns there only at the end of the war with Rama. Thus 
a-sura-s are not earthly demons but celestial beings of a kind like other demi-gods, 
namely yaksha, gandharva, kinnara, kimpurusha etc.

Shlok 10: "The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on 
seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namely the ocean will not pulsate either. 
[1-15-10]

[Commentary] And ocean hides those undulating waves from Ravana for the waves are his wives whom Ravana 
may abduct as in the case of Seetha.

Shlok 11: "Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence 
oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination. [1-15-11]

Shlok 12: When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said "Aha! The 
idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned. [1-15-12]

Shlok 13: "Ravana said while seeking boon that, 'I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or 
by gods, or by other demons...' and I also said 'so be it..." [1-15-13]

Shlok 14: "That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his 
death does not occur otherwise." So said Brahma to gods. [1-15-14]

Shlok 15: On hearing Brahma explaining himself, then all those gods and great sages became adequately 
happy. [1-15-15]

Shlok 16- 17: In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted 
on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, 
clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and 
his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous 
gift called the rain. [1-15-16, 17]

[Commentary] Vishnu is a four handed deity. He handles a Divine Lotus suggesting that he is the creator
sR^iSTikartaa. An ever-cycling disc called sudarshana-chakra is handled 
symbolising his ever-lasting dynamism. He is the maintainer of that continuous dynamism of 
already created Universe sthiti-kartaa. A mace called kaumodakii for bludgeoning 
enemies as he is the eradicator of evil samhaarakartaa, and a conch-shell called
paanchajanya which produces the sound of Om, listening to which salvation, mukti, 
is achieved by the true devotee. The sound of the same conch shell gives out an unbearable 
sound in respect of enemies. He is entered here without a lotus in hand. That means there 
is no need for a creation afresh. The other items he is handling are enough to deal with Ravana. 
If the Lotus is not handled that hand is taken as a blessing hand, abhayahasta. 
And now he is giving that a+bhaya no fear, an assurance, to all gods.

[Commentary] The expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference to the previous 
chapter's garuDa-yajnavedi , Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire that is laid by priests 
of Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that Garuda, also called suparNa, 
the Divine Eagle will fly in to transport oblations. The Vedic ritual is also called suparNa, 
the golden winged, or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle 
of Vishnu is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here 
this Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the chanting of 
Vedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming mounted on the same meritorious 
carrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of Sun's coming mounted on a black cloud has some 
thing to do with yajna. A silver cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable 
combination with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall 
is due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals of Dasharatha, 
in the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun 
both are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will shower grace by eradicating the evil called 
Ravana, and the sun by showering the gratuitous and cooling rains.

Shlok 18: Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down 
and offering prayers addressed Vishnu. [1-15-18]

Shlok 19- 20- 21a: "Oh! Vishnu, desiring prosperity in all the worlds we nominate you to become the son of the 
ruler and lord of Ayodhya, namely Dasharatha, who is a virtuous one, renowned one and one 
whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king 
Dasharatha, who are in similitude with the hrii, the virtue, shrii, the 
affluence, and kiirti, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth 
as their son. [1-15-19, 20, 21a]

[Commentary] These three hrii, shrii, kiirti are the daughters of Daksha Prajapati in their earlier 
births. The hrii is hR^illekha , virtuous disposition - which Queen Kausalya 
has, and who begot Rama. The shrii is shriikaara , the affluence of everything, 
which Queen Sumitra has, by which alone she magnificently and unhesitatingly advises her son 
Lakshmana to go along with Rama to woods. And the third, kiirti, the glory, and the 
glory of Kaika is well known. The position of this epic minus Kaika can be imagined, thereby 
her glory, may it be negative, that may be imagined.

Shlok 21b- 22a: "Oh! Vishnu, on your taking birth as human through the wives of Dasharatha you eliminate Ravana 
in war, who has become exacerbating and thorny to all worlds, and who is otherwise not eliminable 
for gods. [1-15-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "He that preposterous demon Ravana with his invigorated doggedness is torturing gods along 
with eminent saints, gandharva-s, and siddha-s. [1-15-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "He that furious one with his insolence is knocking down sages from their celestial abodes, 
and like that he is knocking down the gandharva-s and apsara celestials too from the heavenly 
gardens Nandana, where they will be taking delight. [1-15-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "We the celestial beings like siddha-s, gandharva-s, yaksha-s along with sages have actually 
come for his elimination, and thereby we seek shelter in you. [1-15-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: "Oh, enemy tormentor, oh, Vishnu, you are the ultimate recourse for all us in eliminating 
enemies of divinity, hence you make up your mind to take birth in human world." The gods appealed 
to Vishnu that way. [1-15-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27: When the god of gods Vishnu, the supreme one among deities, one who is revered by all worlds 
is eulogised this way, then he spoke to all of those celestials that abide in the righteousness 
and that are in the assemblage, keeping the Forefather Brahma at their helm. [1-15-26a, 27]

Shlok 28- 29- 30a: "Get rid off the fear, let safety be upon you, on eliminating that cruel and evil-minded Ravana 
who became dreadful to deities and sages, along with his sons, grandsons, friends, cousins 
and relatives, ministers and forces too in war for your welfare, I will then reside in human 
world ruling this earth for eleven thousand years." Thus Vishnu assured the gods. [1-15-28, 
29, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: On giving boon to all gods in that way the kind-hearted god Vishnu started to think about 
the instituting base for his birth in human world. [1-15-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: And then that lotus-petal-eyed one agreeing to manifest himself in fourfold way is predisposed 
towards Dasharatha to be his father. [1-15-31b, 32a]

[Commentary] There is a great lot of discussion whether Vishnu made himself fourfold as Rama, Lakshmana, 
Bharata an Shatrughna, or he himself incarnated along with his main ingredients like conch 
shell, disc, mace as those three brothers. This verse says that he 'made himself, or agreed 
to make himself as fourfold.' Even then, there are discussions that Rama is a 'full incarnation'
puurNa avataara as the Supreme is indivisible - on one account. And his brothers 
cannot be reckoned as his incarnation  as they become parts of the whole but not the 
'whole' itself he did not divide himself on the other account. And the tradition believes 
that Vishnu did not divide himself but incarnated in one piece, where his brothers are his 
paraphernalia. There is no unanimity on this, as yet.

Shlok 32b: Then all the groups of gods, sages, gandharva-s, with rudraa-s, and apsarasa-s, extolled Vishnu 
with prayers of divine exposition. [1-15-32b, c]

[Commentary] Vishnu in early times killed a ghastly demon called Madhu and his brother Kaitabha, hence 
He is also called Madhusuudana. This is one the thousand names of Vishnu.

Shlok 33: "Oh! Vishnu, he that fiery one who is renowned for evil acts and who is the hater of Indra, 
that Ravana is uprising furiously with his heightened arrogance, and he has become a thorn in the 
side of hermits hence he is a fright to sages, afor he tortures insubordinates to the the extent of 
loud wailing; hence we pray you to eliminate that Ravana." [1-15-33]

Shlok 34: "On eliminating that furiously vainglorious Ravana with all his forces and with all his kinsmen 
neutralise the pandemonium created by him in all the worlds, and for a long time to come you 
get rid of your febrility, and you please return to your heavenly abode, namely your blameless 
and faultless Vaikuntha. [1-15-34]



SARGA 16
------------------------------

[Text] Vishnu agrees to incarnate as human and selects Dasharatha as his father. And when Dasharatha 
is performing the Vedic ritual called putrakaameSTi a deity called
praajaapatya-puruSha arises from the sacrificial fire to give 
a golden vessel of divine dessert to Dasharatha for distribution among his queens to beget 
progeny. The three queens on consuming that dessert conceive their children.

Shlok 1: Later when the Omnipresent Narayana is thus nominated by best gods, and though he knows the 
outcome, he gently spoke these words to gods in this way. [1-16-1]

[Commentary] The name Vishnu indicates his all pervading Omnipresence in all beings, sessile or mobile:
vyaapitvaat sarvabhuuteSu vishnuH iti abhidhiiyate. This is one of his thousand 
names, called Vishnu sahasranaama , each name elucidating his attributes.

Shlok 2: "What is the idea to eliminate that demon's chief Ravana, oh, gods, adopting which strategy 
I will have to eliminate that thorn in the side of sages?" Thus Vishnu asked the gods. [1-16-2]

Shlok 3: Asked thus all the gods said to that sempiternal Vishnu, "on assuming a human form, eliminate 
Ravana in a war." [1-16-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, destroyer of enemies, he that Ravana undertook a vehement ascesis for a long period, 
thereby the creator of worlds and the first born one Brahma, felt gladsome of his ascesis. 
[1-16-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "Satisfied with his ascesis Brahma gave boon to that demon that he shall have no fear for 
his life from many kinds of beings, excepting humans, because that demon indeed slighted humans 
earlier at the time of bestowing boon. [1-16-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7: "Thus, on getting boon from the Forefather Brahma he has become arrogant and torturing the 
three worlds, and he is even abducting women. As such, oh, enemy destroyer Vishnu, his elimination 
is envisaged through humans alone." So said gods to Vishnu. [1-16-6b, 7]

Shlok 8: On hearing that speech of gods said that way, he that kind-hearted Vishnu then chose Dasharatha 
as his father in human world. [1-16-8]

Shlok 9: During that time the great resplendent king and an enemy subduer Dasharatha is performing
putrakaameSTi ritual, desiring progeny as he is sonless. [1-16-9]

Shlok 10: On taking a decision Vishnu took leave of Forefather Brahma, and vanished while he is still 
being extolled by gods and sages. [1-16-10]

Shlok 11: Then, from Fire of Altar Dasharatha's ritual there emerged a greatly vigorous and energetic 
Divine Being with an unparalleled resplendence, called yajna-puruSa. 
[1-16-11]

Shlok 12: He is clad in black and red garments and his face is red and his voice resembled the drumbeat. 
His moustache and hairdo are soft like that of a lion's mane. [1-16-12]

Shlok 13: And he is endowed with auspicious features and decorated with divine ornaments, in height 
he is like a mountain peak, and in valiance he is like an imperious tiger. [1-16-13]

Shlok 14: That great ritual being personally brought a big golden vessel carrying it with both of his 
hands as if he would personally handle his own wife, which vessel is made from the molten 
gold and covered with a silver lid, and which appeared to be crafted out of a divine illusion, 
since it is dazzling like sun and glowing like the tongues of flame, and that vessel is full 
with the divine dessert. [1-16-14, 15]

Shlok 16: That divine person on observing king Dasharatha said these words "oh, king, you may know me 
as the being sent by Prajapati." [1-16-16]

Shlok 17: There after, king Dasharatha greeted that divine being with palms adjoining and said in reply, 
"oh, god, welcome to you, and what shall I do for you?" [1-16-17]

Shlok 18: Then again, that divine being sent by Prajapati said these words, "oh, king, now you have 
obtained this dessert in golden vessel as you have propitiated gods. [1-16-18]

Shlok 19: "Oh, tigerly king, take this dessert prepared by divinities, this is a blessed dessert that 
enriches progeny and health. [1-16-19]

Shlok 20: "Oh, king, let this be consumed" saying so he further said, "for which purpose you have performed 
this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give 
this among your eligible wives." So said the divine being to Dasharatha. [1-16-20]

Shlok 21: Agreeing to that the king wholeheartedly took that god-given golden vessel full with divine 
food. [1-16-21]

Shlok 22: With high ecstasy Dasharatha revered that Ritual Being, the Prajaapati- 
PuruSha or yaj~na-puruSha , an astonishing and delightful 
being in his appearance, and performed circumambulations around him. [1-16-22]

Shlok 23: On obtaining that dessert prepared by gods then Dasharatha is highly gladdened like a pauper 
obtaining unforeseen wealth. [1-16-23]

Shlok 24: On completing his work of giving the golden vessel with dessert then that divine being who 
is astonishing by his form and highly glowing by his physique, disappeared then and there 
itself. [1-16-24]

Shlok 25: Lit up with beams of happiness Dasharatha's palace chambers shone forth like the autumnal 
sky brightened with moonbeams. [1-16-25]

Shlok 26: Then Dasharatha on entering palace chambers spoke this to queen Kausalya, "Receive this dessert 
to beget your son." [1-16-26]

[Commentary] This divine dessert is meant for the 'eligible' queens, as informed the Ritual Being and also 
in order to maintain the divinity of Ram's birth. In the context of seed and field, the field 
has no equal importance to the seed biija-kShetra nyaaya . Hence the seed is divine 
in the form of dessert and fields are therefore shall 'be eligible' for the seedling. As such 
the First Queen and Empress Kausalya is being addressed firstly, and given firstly.

Shlok 27- 28: The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the half, i.e., 
one fourth to queen Sumitra. And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one 
eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, 
i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to 
his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]

[Commentary] This is a much-discussed distribution by the traditionalists. Adhyaatma Ramayana, a treatise 
that postulates god-hood to Rama, gives a well-constructed argument about these shares of 
dessert and the resultant births of the four brothers, viz., Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and 
Shatrughna, in accordance with these shares. In its simplest terms and as contained in these 
verses, queen Kausalya got half of the dessert as an Empress, paTTa-mahiSi. Sumitra 
gets one-fourth in the first round and after a rethink by Dasharatha, she gets another one-eighth 
portion. Kaikeyi gets only a one-eighth quantity. Thus, Kausalya gives birth to Rama, Sumitra 
to Lakshmana and Shatrughna, and Kaikeyi to Bharata. The quantum of apportionment of the dessert 
does not make Rama all-powerful or Bharata the least. Since the Absolute is indivisible into 
parts, the dessert that is divided is not to be taken as the divided Absolute, but a kind 
of medium through which the incarnation is made possible.

[Commentary] There is another declination enquiring whether the incarnation of Rama is full or partial,
puurNa-avatara or ardha-avatara... Rama is Vishnu Himself while Bharata 
and Shatrughna are his disc and conch-shell, while Lakshmana is the thousand headed snake
aadisheSha on whose coils Vishnu reclines. The whole dessert is divine and parts 
of it do not signify and inter-divided god-hoods. Hence, the apportionment of the desert is 
done in order to keep up the hierarchy of the queen-hoods and their status. Throughout this 
magnum opus Rama never said that he is god or an incarnate of god, but called himself, 
nimitta-maatra a casual relation to the course of events. Should Rama be the incarnation 
of the Almighty Himself, he has little or no necessity to incarnate the weaponry along with 
him. They are at his beck and call at any time. Thus, Rama is neither a half nor one-fourth 
incarnation of the Absolute nor a dividend of the whole, but an incarnate of the virtuously 
ideal personality of Vishnu, maryaadaa purushottama Rama.

[Commentary] Incidental to this apportionment of the dessert, the aspect of eldest son is also studied. 
Rama is the first-born and thus the eldest. This is because the dessert is given to queen 
Kausalya in the first instance, and half of the whole vessel. She immediately consumed to 
lionise her share and as an Empress. Sumitra waited a while till apportionment is complete. 
Kaikeyi got her portion but waited till her elder sister Sumitra completes her drink. In the 
meanwhile Dasharatha thought a while, as said in the verse, and gave Sumitra another one-eighth 
part. Sumitra then consumed her two parts. Later Kaikeyi drinks her dividend.

Shlok 30: On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with 
happiness, deemed it as a reward. [1-16-30]

Shlok 31: Then on consuming dessert those best ladies of the king whose resplendence then vied with 
that Fire and Sun became pregnant after some time. [1-16-31]

[Commentary] A synecdochic expression to indicate that Sun and Fire, the enliveners of living beings,
pratyakSha-naraayaNa are there in those wombs and their resplendence is shining out 
of mothers bodies.

Shlok 32: Then on seeing his queens with confirmed pregnancies Dasharatha regained his lost heart for 
sons, and he is gladdened like Vishnu, who will always be gladsome when worshipped by gods, 
namely Indra and others, as well as by the assemblages of great souls, sages. [1-16-32]

[Text] The gods become progenitors Vanara heroes at the dictate of Brahma to come to 
			the aid of Rama in annihilating Ravana. The monkey-like Vanara race is procreated 
			by numerous celestials endowing it with peculiar mighty physique and particular 
			power to come to the help of Rama.

Shlok 1: When Vishnu attained the sonship of the great-souled king Dasharatha, then Brahma 
			the self-created addressed all of the gods this way. [1-17-1]

Shlok 2: "Let mighty and guise changing helpmates be procreated to that truth abiding and 
			valorous Vishnu who is the well-wisher of all of us. [1-17-2]

Shlok 3: "Let monkey-shaped progeny equalling Vishnu's valour be procreated from the physiques 
			of prominent apsara-s and gandharva-s, from the girls of yaksha-s and pannaga-s, 
			and also thus from the bodies of kinnaraa-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, she-riksha-s 
			and she-monkeys, and they shall be wizards of miracles and audacious ones, in 
			travel they shall have air's speed, bestowed with intellect they shall be the 
			knowers of ideation, and with their divine physique they shall be ineliminable, 
			they shall be endowed with all the assaultive aspects of all missiles, and they 
			shall be untiring in their efforts, like you who thrive on amrita, the ambrosia, 
			unmindful of thirst and hunger. [1-17-3, 4, 5, 6]

[Commentary] Gandharva-s (Southey's Glendoveers) are celestial musicians inhabiting Indra's 
			heaven and forming the orchestra at all the banquets of the principal deities. 
			Yaksha-s, demigods attendant especially on Kubera, and employed by him in the 
			care of his garden and treasures. Kimpurusha-s, demigods attached also to the 
			service of Kubera, celestial musicians, represented like centaurs reversed with 
			human figures and horses' heads. Siddha-s, are demigods or spirits of undefined 
			attributes, occupying with the Vidyaadharaa-s the middle air or region between 
			the earth and the sun. Griffith.

Shlok 7: "I have already created the eminent bear Jambavanta in earlier times, as he suddenly 
			came forth from my yawning face. [1-17-7]

[Commentary] This is to say that Brahma has already created such a typical being, namely Jambavanta, 
			prior to all the gods, as a role model in creation.

Shlok 8: When Brahma addressed them thus, those gods have agreed to his order and accordingly 
			started to parent sons in the resemblance of monkeys. [1-17-8]

[Commentary] This pedigree is not yet given the label of monkeys. They are look alike of monkeys 
			but not monkeys, vaanararuupiNam resembling monkeys, as said in the verse. 
			The word vanara is vane carati iti vanaraH because they range far and 
			wide over forests they are called vanara-s, but not exactly a monkey race.

Shlok 9: The great-souled celestial groups, namely the sages, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, 
			caarana-s have created valiant sons that are forest rangers. [1-17-9]

Shlok 10: Indra procreated the lord of vanara-s, namely Vali, who by his physique is like 
			Mt. Mahendra, and the highest humidifier among all the humidifiers, namely the 
			Sun, procreated Sugreeva. [1-17-10]

Shlok 11: Brihaspati, the Jupiter, gave rise to a great monkey named Tara, who is the most 
			important one among all vanara-s, and who excels all by his intelligence. [1-17-11]

[Commentary] Tara here is a vanara hero but not Lady Tara, the wife of Vali. Here we have the 
			wording of kapiH the monkey ï¿½ for these forest rangers for first time.

Shlok 12: The brilliant Gandhamaadana is the son of Kubera, while the divine architect Vishvakarma 
			procreated the great monkey called Nala. [1-17-12]

Shlok 13: The bright son of Fire is Neela whose blaze is like that of fire and who excels 
			other monkeys by his resplendence, renown and courage. [1-17-13]

Shlok 14: The Ashwin twin gods whose wealth is their beautiful appearance have personally 
			procreated two vanara-s namely Mainda and Dvivida, blessing them with beautiful 
			appearance.[1-17-14]

Shlok 15: The Rain-god procreated the vanara named Sushena, and Thunder-god gave rise 
			to the great mighty Sharabha. [1-17-15]

Shlok 16- 17a: The direct son of Air-god is the marvellous and adventurous Hanuma with an indestructible 
			body, and one identical in the speed of lady Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the 
			divine eagle vehicle of Vishnu, and among all monkey chiefs he is the intelligent 
			and the indefatigable one too. [1-17-16, 17a]

[Commentary] Garuda: The bird and vehicle of Vishnu. He is generally represented as a being 
			something between a man and a bird and considered as the sovereign of the feathered 
			race. He may be compared with the Simurgh of the Persians, the Ank of the Arabs, 
			the Griffin of chivalry [without lion's body,] the Phoenix of Egypt, and the bird 
			that sits upon the ash Yggdrasil of the Edda. - Griffith.

Shlok 17b- 18a: Thus the gods have procreated many thousands of such valorous and guise changing 
			monkeys who with their immeasurable strength and bravery are manifest for the 
			elimination of the decahedral demon Ravana. [1-17-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: And they with their elephantine, mountainous and prodigious bodies quickly took 
			birth in bears, monkeys, sacred langoors. [1-17-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Those that are procreated have attained the shape, getup and valour of the god 
			that has fathered them, and thus the monkey race is procreated separately and 
			individually. [1-17-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: Some of the vanara-s endowed with superior valour are born to female langoors, 
			and like that some more to female bears and kinnaraa-s. [1-17-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22- 23- 24a: Several of the gods, great-sages, gandharva-s, eagles, yaksha-s, and the celebrated 
			reptiles, kimpurusha-s, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, uraga-s and caarana-s and even 
			the prominent maidens of apsara-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, naaga, gandharva-s then 
			gladly procreated all of the thousands of forest-ranging and valiant vanara sons 
			from their bodies that are forest rangers. [21b, 22, 23, 24a, b]

Shlok 24b- 25a: They are endowed with guise changing faculties, with bodily might and by their 
			pride and might are identical to lions and tigers, and they are born-free in their 
			movement in forests. [1-17-24c, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: All of them are the assaulters with stones, and all are the attackers with trees, 
			and all have their nails and claws as their weapons, yet all are experts in missiles. 
			[1-17-25b, 26a]

[Commentary] Rama and Lakshmana will use arrows and missiles as their weaponry in the ensuing 
			final war with Ravana. The vanara soldiers use stones, trees, and their own claws 
			and nails. The golden maces or clubs handled by Hanuma, Sugreeva, and Vali usually 
			depicted in pictures are for more mythical ornamentation to glorify the characters. 
			However, these Vaanaras are well versed in the knowledge of such tactical weaponry, 
			only to save themselves from their usage against them, but do not use them necessarily. 
			In Sundara Kanda Hanuma will be tied by a magical weapon called Brahmaastra when 
			he is in Lanka. Though knowing the release from that Brahmaastra, Hanuma does 
			not utilise that knowledge there.

Shlok 26b- 27a: They can rock greatest mountains, rip firm rooted trees, and with their speed 
			they can agitate the of lord of rivers, namely the ocean. [1-17-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: They can shatter the ground with their two feet, leap and cross over great oceans, 
			and they can seize the clouds entering arch of heaven. [1-17-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: They can catch ruttish elephants that tumultuously move in forests, and just with 
			the sound of their blare they make sky flying birds to fall. [1-17-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Thus the gods and others have procreated millions of such noble souled Vaanaras 
			as the chiefs of warriors who can change their guise at their wish. [1-17-29b, 
			30a]

Shlok 30a- 31b: Those vanara generals who took birth thus became the prominent generals among 
			the principle battalions of monkeys, and they have also procreated brave monkeys 
			on their own. [1-17-30a, 31b]

Shlok 31b- 32a: Some thousands of them stayed on the ridges of Mt. Rikshavat while others reached 
			many kinds of other mountains and forests. [1-17-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33: All of the monkeys stood by the brothers, namely the son of Indra Vali, and the 
			son of sun Sugreeva, and even with the monkey generals like Nala, Neela and Hanuma 
			et al. [1-17-32b, 33]

Shlok 34: All of those who are well-versed in warfare and endowed with the might of divine 
			eagle Garuda, used to thwart the pride of lions, tigers and great snakes just 
			by their own prideful subjugation while they move about the forests. [1-17-34]

Shlok 35: He who is adroit, extremely mighty, and highly indomitable, that Vali protected 
			bears, langoors, and monkeys just by the strength of his arms. [1-17-35]

Shlok 36: The earth with its mountains, forests and oceanward places is overspread with 
			those brave ones that possess diverse physiques and peculiar indication marks 
			of their stock. [1-17-36]

Shlok 37: The earth is thus suffused with those mighty army generals of Vanara race whose 
			physiques resembled the clusters of clouds and peaks of mountains, and who have 
			emerged for the reason of helping Rama. [1-17-37]



SARGA 18
------------------------------

[Text] After the completion of Vedic ritual all the kings and Sage Rishyasringa took leave of Dasharatha 
and went away to their countries. After some time Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna 
are born. Their virtues in childhood and rituals connected thereto are depicted here. Dasharatha 
then contemplates the marriages of the princes, since marrying sons after completion of education 
is customary. At that juncture Sage Vishvamitra arrives at the court of Dasharatha seeking 
help from the king. Dasharatha receives him adoring in high esteem.

Shlok 1: On the competition of the horse ritual of high-souled Dasharatha, the golds having received 
their portion of sacrificial oblation returned to their abodes as they have come. [1-18-1]

Shlok 2: The king completing his consecratory vows held for horse ritual, entered Ayodhya city along 
with the company of his queens, servants, guards and vehicles. [1-18-2]

Shlok 3: The other kings who arrived for the ritual are delighted when befittingly honoured by the 
king Dasharatha, and they too returned to their countries, after suitably adoring the eminent 
sage Vashishta. [1-18-3]

Shlok 4: The entourages of those kings who set forth homeward from that city are highly gladdened and 
shone forth in fine fettle. [1-18-4]

[Commentary] Some commentaries said that the soldiers are given white and clean uniforms by Dasharatha 
by the word shubhraaNi and hence they are happy. But they may be said to be sprucely 
without those gifts from Dasharatha.

Shlok 5: On the departure of visiting kings, then that fortunate king Dasharatha entered the city Ayodhya, 
keeping eminent Brahman priests ahead of him in the procession. [1-18-5]

Shlok 6: Well adored by king Dasharatha sage Rishyasringa also travelled along with his wife Shanta, 
followed by his father-in-law King Romapada, and along with other co-travellers, namely the 
entourage of Romapada. [1-18-6]

Shlok 7: On dispersing all of them king Dasharatha gratifyingly dwelled there in Ayodhya, with a satiated 
heart dwelling upon the birth of his sons. [1-18-7]

Shlok 8- 9- 10- 11: On completion of the ritual, six seasons have passed by; then in the twelfth month, i.e., 
in chaitra-mAsa, and on the ninth day of that chaitra month [April-May], 
when it is punarvasunakShatrayukta-navamI tithi, i.e., when the ruling star of that 
ninth day is punarvasu, 
for which Aditi is the presiding deity; and when five of the nine planets - sUrya, kuja, guru, 
shukra, shani are in ucChasthAna-s, namely, when those planets are in 
ascension in their respective houses - meSha, makara, karkaTa, mIna, tula - rAshI-s; and when chandrayukta- 
guru, karkaTalagne - Jupiter in conjuction with Moon is ascendant in Cancer, and when day is advancing, 
Queen Kausalya gave birth to a son with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, 
lengthy arms, roseate lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku 
dynasty and adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, 
namely Rama. [1-18-8, 9, 10, 11]



Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month 
of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to 
take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be 
known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory of the grand line of Ikshwku, and 
the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was 
chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension 
in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and 
the Moon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled 
effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the 
Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, 1910.

[Commentary] By this configuration of stars the supreme merits of Rama are indicated.
atra sa~mvatsaramukhottaraayaNa-vasantacaitramaasa-shuklapakShaadeva nakShatra-divaabhijitlagna- 
nakShatra-divaabhijitlagna-puNyanakShatraad utkR^iShTakaale karkaaTakalagne uccasya grahapa~ncake guru-

sakalashiShTaadaraNiiyasampattim mahaaparaakramam ca suucitam |dharmaakuutam.

[Commentary] The phrase viSNoH adtham half of Vishnu - is to be taken as
half of the fruit of ritual where Vedic ritual itself is pervaded 
by Vishnu. The fruit of ritual is obtained in the shape of dessert, and Kausalya consumed 
half of it, but it is not half of Vishnu as he is illimitable. Even Sreenivasa Aiyangar took 
it as half, in saying half of Vishnu's essence is Rama. This has become a perennial topic debating whether 
the incarnation of Rama is a pUrNaavatAra, ardhaavatAra or aMshaavatAra.

Shlok 12: Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who 
once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods. [1-18-12]

Shlok 13: Queen Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, one embodied with all merits, and whose truthfulness 
itself is his valour and who is fourth component of manifest Vishnu, namely Rama. [1-18-13]

[Commentary] The fraction indicated here like 'one fourth of Vishnu' etc may be reckoned as the share of 
the dessert consumed by the queens, but not as a cleaved portion of Vishnu as he is an indivisible 
entity. Here it is half of one-fourth i.e., one-eighth of dessert given to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 14: Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely 
Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry. [1-18-14]

Shlok 15: With the dawn of sun on the next day, fair-minded Bharata is born under Pisces where puSyami 
			is the star of day, later the sons of Sumitra, namely Lakshmana and Shatrughna are 
			born under Cancer, where aashleSa is the star of the 
			day, i.e., the tenth of chaitra month, [1-18-15]

[Commentary] Rama is born on the ninth day of Chaitra month, and Bharata is born in the earlier 
			part of next day the tenth of Chaitra, earlier to his younger brothers, and then 
			Lakshmana and Shatrughna are born on the later part of that tenth day.

[Commentary] 'Pushya is the name of a month; but here it means the eighth mansion. The ninth is called 
AshleSh, or the snake. It is evident from this that Bharata, though his birth is mentioned 
before that of the twins, was the youngest of the four brothers and Rama's junior by eleven 
months' -- Schlegel.

[Commentary] The eleven-month gap between Rama and Bharata is unapparent in the words 
of verse. This may be from some other version of Ramayana.

Shlok 16: Thus there are four great-souled sons of Dasharatha, born on separate instances, who are virtuous, 
charming, and by brilliance they are in similitude with two stars of each of the asterisms 
called puurvaabhaadra and uttaraabhaadra. 
[1-18-16]

[Commentary] The word proSTa is cow; pada feet; the feet of a cow. It is also the name 
for the asterisms puurvaabhaadra, uttaraabaadra, containing stars in the wing of 
Pegasus, each of which will have two stars, and all the four stars make a perfect square. 
Like the pairs of stars the brother also move in pairs - Rama, Lakshmana; Bharata, Shatrughna.

[Commentary] The epithet mahaatmaanaH high-souled ones is though negligible for peripheral reading, 
it is explained as: Rama is one such, as he undertakes svadharmaanuSThaana ; Lakshmana 
by his sheSatvaj~naana ; Bharata by his bhagavatpaaratantrya ; and Shatrughna 
by his bhaagavata-paaratantrya.

[Commentary] Like this, each of the epithets used in Ramayana has something or the other meaning which 
is not generally recorded in English translations. All the English translations are story-oriented, 
as though there is some unknown story in Ramayana for retelling afresh. In the spate of telling 
story again and again these niceties are lost. The same is the position with the numerous 
epithets given to Seetha in Aranya Kanda. Readers may please note that each epithet conveys 
some meaning and if we could not incorporate them, it is our misfortune in getting a book 
containing their meanings. We request the readers to kindly inform us if they have come across 
the meanings of these seemingly useless and metre-filling-like epithets in any book, so that, 
that book will be brought to the notice of readers who are mistaking them as 'redundant stanza 
fillers'.

Shlok 17- 18a: The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums 
drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with 
thronging people. [1-18-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: Hilarity filled the streets with people stampeding them and with the flurry of actors, dancers, 
singers and instrumentalists, as well by other onlookers, and there on the streets widely 
strewn are all kinds of gems appreciating the artists. [1-18-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: The king gave worthy gifts to eulogisers, bard singers, and panegyrists, and to Brahmans he 
gave funds and wealth in the form of thousands of cows. [1-18-20]

Shlok 21- 22: Elapsed are eleven days and the naming ceremony is performed, then Vashishta, the chief priest, 
named the high-souled elder one as Rama, Kaikeyi's son as Bharata, and one son of Sumitra 
as Lakshmana and the other as Shatrughna [1-18-21, 22]

[Commentary] The word 'Rama' is defined as 
ramante sarve janaaH guNaiH asmin iti raamaH 'in whom all the people 
take delight for his virtuousness, thus he is Rama.' The name Rama is very old, so says
padma puraaNa : shriyaH kamalavaasinyaH raameNaaham mahaaprabhuH |
 tasmaat shriiraama iti asya naamasiddhi puraatanam || padma puraaNa

[Commentary] Bharata is defined as: bharataH raajyabharaNaat - bibharti iti bharata
 Bharata is because he bears the burden of the kingdom of Rama during Rama's exile.

[Commentary] Lakshmana is lakShmaNo laksmisampannaH or
lakShmiiH asya astiiti lakShmaNa Lakshmana is the favoured flourisher. 
The wealth of selfless dedication is in him, hence Lakshmana. One who is endowed with favoured 
dedication, kainkaryalakShaNalakshitaH Lakshmana is a hearty dedication to Rama 
and he always wishes to reside by the side of his brother.

[Commentary] Shatrughna is shatruun hanti iti shatrughnaH. Or 
shatrughno nityashatru-ghnaHShatrughna is always an enemy destroyer.

[Commentary] The naming ceremony acquires a particular significance, because Vashishta, the purohita 
= puraa future; hitaH well-wisher of; well wishing advisor about the future 
of the kingdom, named these princes with a vision into the future.

Shlok 23- 24a: The king feasted Brahmans, urbanites and villagers and he gifted many valuable gems to Brahmans 
in an unlimited way, and all the rituals of birth and ceremonies sequel to it like naming 
ceremony, first-food-feeding ceremony, first-hair-removal ceremony, and sacred thread ceremony 
are performed in respect of the princes. [1-18-23, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: Among those princes the eldest one Rama is like a flagstaff and a delight of his father Dasharatha, 
and he became acceptable to all beings like the self-created Brahma. [1-18-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: All the princes are scholars in Veda-s, valiant ones, all are interested in the welfare of 
the world, all are intellectuals and all of them possess an air of probity. [1-18-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Among them the great resplendent Rama, whose valour itself is his truthfulness, is the dear 
one to all the world like the tranquil moon. [1-18-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: Rama is admittedly a champion of riding elephants and horses, also in tactical charioting, 
and he rejoices in the art of archery, and absorbed in the obedient service of his father. 
[1-18-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: Right from childhood Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, is always amiable towards his 
world-charming elder brother Rama. [1-18-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Lakshmana who is endowed with the wealth of dedication dedicated himself to Rama with bodily 
service, and while performing all agreeable deeds in respect of Rama, he behaved like Rama's 
alter ego. [1-18-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: That best one among the men Rama does not get his sleep without Lakshmana and he would 
not eat food brought for him, however delicious it may be, without Lakshmana. [1-18-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: Whenever Raghava mounts a horse and goes on a hunting game Lakshmana rushes after him wielding 
his bow as a squire. [1-18-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: Lakshmana's younger brother Shatrughna is a dear one to Bharata, like that Bharata too held 
Shatrughna dearer than his own lives. [1-18-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33: King Dasharatha is highly gladdened with four of his highly fortunate sons like the Forefather 
Brahma with gods in heaven. [1-18-33]

Shlok 34b- 35- 36a: When all of the four sons are thus prospering with prudence, gifted with all the merits, self-conscious 
to do wrong deeds, well-known for their gentility, knowers of pros and cons and even the conscientious 
princes, then their father Dasharatha is contented in respect of all of them who are such 
radiantly brilliant and potential princes, like Brahma. [1-18-34b, 35, 36a]

Shlok 36: Even those tigerly-men, namely the princes, are engrossed in the studies of Veda-s, delighted 
to render service to their father and they are also the experts in art of archery. [1-18-36b, 
37a]

Shlok 37b- 38a: Then the noble souled Dasharatha contemplated along with his priestly teachers and relatives 
about the matrimonial alliances of his sons. [1-18-37b, 38a]

Shlok 38b- 39a: While the great souled Dasharatha is discussing the marriages of princes among his ministers, 
the highly powerful sage Vishvamitra arrived. [1-18-38b, 39a]

Shlok 39b- 40a: Desirous to have an audience with king Vishvamitra said to the doorkeeper, "Let the king be 
informed quickly that I, the son of Gadhi from the dynasty of Kushi, have come" [1-18-39b, 
40a]

Shlok 40b- 41a: On listening those words all the doorkeepers are dumbfounded, and ushered by those words they 
quickly rushed to the place of Dasharatha. [1-18-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b- 42a: Then on their arriving at the king's palace the doorkeepers have announced to the king of 
Ikshvaku-s, namely Dasharatha, about the arrival of sage Vishvamitra. [1-18-41b, 42a]

Shlok 42b- 43a: On hearing that message from doorkeepers Dasharatha is highly pleased and he has gone towards 
Vishvamitra in a self-possessed manner along with royal priests, as Indra would ceremoniously 
go towards Brahma. [1-18-42b, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: Then on seeing the resplendent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is by his own ascesis and 
who has severe self-discipline, the king offered water with a gladsome aspect, as first customary 
hospitality in receiving unexpected guest. [1-18-43b, 44a]

Shlok 44b- 45a: On receiving water from the king scripturally and customarily Vishvamitra enquired after the 
well-being and welfare of king Dasharatha. [1-18-44b, 45a]

Shlok 45b- 46a: That highly righteous sage Vishvamitra asked the king after the well-being of city, exchequer, 
rural areas, friends and relatives. [1-18-45b, 46a]

Shlok 46b- 47a: Sage Vishvamitra asked Dasharatha, "Are all of the provincial kings acquiescent to you, and 
all your enemies conquered? Are you properly performing the devotional and social works?" 
[1-18-46b, 47a]

Shlok 47b- 48a: And on meeting the eminent sage Vashishta and with them the other exalted sages according 
to custom Vishvamitra asked after their well-being. [1-18-47b, 48a]

Shlok 48b- 49a: Then adoringly invited by the king Dasharatha all of them gladly entered the palace and they 
took their seats according to protocol. [1-18-48b, 49a]

Shlok 49b- 50a: Then the very generous king Dasharatha is gladdened at heart at the arrival of Vishvamitra, 
and he spoke this way feeling happy to adore that sage. [1-18-49b, 50a]

Shlok 50b- 51- 52b: "I deem your arrival is in the vein of mortals attaining ambrosia, rainfall in a droughty 
land, a barren father begetting a son through his deserving wife, a regain of long lost treasures, 
and the gladness at a great happening, oh, great saint, welcome to you." [1-18-50b, 51, 52a]

Shlok 52b- 53- 54a: "Oh, Brahman, as I am the one who is delighted for your arrival, and as you are the most eligible 
recipient from me, what is that choicest object of yours to be fulfilled by me, and in which 
way. Oh, endower of respect, for me your arrival is fortunate whereby my birth is fructified 
and my life flourished today, and wherefore I could see a great Brahman like you visiting 
my home, therefore the sun appears to have dawned in my night. [1-18-52b, 53, 54a]

Shlok 54b- 55a: "Originally your glory was explicit by your title kingly-sage, and subsequently you 
attained the Absolute-sainthood by your ascesis, and you are venerable to me, in many 
ways." [1-18-54b, 55a]

Shlok 55b- 56a: "Oh, Brahman, thereby your arrival at my place is surprising and ideally sacred to me, and 
by your very appearance I have become one who has gone on a quiet pilgrimage. [1-18-55b, 56a]

[Commentary] Dasharatha deems that city itself is sanctified with the arrival of Vishvamitra and thinks 
that he is like the one who secured the merit of pilgrimage without actually going over a 
sacred place.

Shlok 56b- 57a: "You may tell me, entreating which work your arrival chanced here and I feel that I am indeed 
blessed and wish to make it happen to achieve results. [1-18-56b, 57a]

Shlok 57b- 58a: "It is unapt of you to deliberate about the feasibility of the work, oh, sage with blest vows, 
while I am the fulfiller of it without any reminder, since you are god to me, indeed. [1-18-57b, 
58a]

Shlok 58b: "Oh, Brahman, this is the great prosperity that bechanced on me, and this is propriety in 
its entirety that bechanced on me, as a result of your arrival. [1-18-58b, c]

Shlok 59: On hearing the words of high-minded Dasharatha, said that way in all his humbleness, and those 
that are pleasant to ears as well to heart, he who is a renowned for his personal attributes 
and a reputed one by his exceptional qualities, that sublime sage Vishvamitra obtained high 
rejoice. [1-18-59]



SARGA 19
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra asks King Dasharatha to send Rama to protect the Vedic ritual 
			that is being conducted by him, from the demons that are constantly disrupting 
			it. The sage asserts King Dasharatha that he and the other sages in Dasharatha's 
			court know the capabilities of Rama and though Rama is in his adolescence, he 
			can easily kill the demons. But Dasharatha is upset at this request.

Shlok 1: On listening the grand and detailed sentences of that King the lion Dasharatha, 
			the great resplendent Sage Vishvamitra is thrilled with happiness and spoke this 
			way. [1-19-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, tigerly king, to you befitting are these words and to none else, as you are 
			born in a great dynasty and tutored by Vashishta. [1-19-2]

Shlok 3: "What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, 
			oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises. [1-19-3]

Shlok 4: "These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, 
			oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that 
			ritual. [1-19-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained 
			demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams 
			of meat and blood. [1-19-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the 
			ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. [1-19-6n, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall 
			be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, 
			isn't it. [1-19-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "As such, oh, tigerly king, it will be apt of you spare the services of that brave 
			one whose valour itself is his truthfulness, that youngling whose hair locks are 
			all the more jet black like crow wings on either side of his head, spare that 
			eldest son of yours, namely Rama. [1-19-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual 
			by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. [1-19-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown 
			in all the three worlds, no doubt about it. [1-19-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Those two demons will be rendered incapable to stand fast on affronting Rama 
			in anywise, and none other than Raghava has the fortitude to eliminate those two. 
			[1-19-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Those two sinners that are berserk by their vigour have gone into the subjection 
			of death's noose, oh tigerly king, cannot counterbalance the great-souled Rama. 
			[1-19-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "It will be unapt of you to show your paternal fondness, oh, king, upon my oath, 
			be assured that those two demons are eradicated. [1-19-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "I am sensible of that sublime-soul Rama, whose valour is his truthfulness, and 
			even this great resplendent Vashishta and these saints that are here are aware. 
			[1-19-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] These verses are commented extensively by early commentators. In 14th verse, the 
			pronoun aham, 'I' used by Sage Vishvamitra is to announce definiteness 
			about his own stature to know the Absolute vis-a-vis the Absolute Himself. Vishvamitra 
			was an emperor who left off everything. He was primarily a raajarShi, 
			kingly sage, later became brahmarShi and performed mokShakaameSTi. 
			That is a highest ascesis for achieving salvation. Whereas Dasharatha performed 
			Vedic ritual called putrakaameSTi, ritual for begetting sons, as he 
			is still involved in earthly passions. Thus he is still in karmic cycle and recently 
			went under the veil of moha, worldly delusion, advent to the birth of 
			sons. So Dasharatha cannot know who Rama is. All these aspects are said to qualify 
			that expression aham, i.e., 'I am', as said by Vishvamitra.

[Commentary] He also says aham vedmi , it is not just 'I know' but 'I am in full knowledge 
			of Rama' and it is immediately followed by mahaatmaanam, about the 
			sublime soul Rama. Rama is at present a twelve-year lad, and Dasharatha should 
			have enquired how a boy is said to be a sublime-soul. Dasharatha did not bother 
			to enquire about the high souled property of his son, because of his newfound 
			fondness for sons. But, Vishvamitra is in full knowledge as to who Rama is, and 
			says Rama is a sublime-soul, as contained in scripture puruSasuukta 
			which says vedaahametam puruSam mahaantam, and as in yo maam pashyati sarvatra....sa ca Me 
			na praNasyati Bhagavad Gita, 6-30, as well.

[Commentary] In next foot at 15th verse, Vishvamitra argues that he is not just extolling Rama 
			to achieve his personal purpose, i.e., the completion of ritual. He says, 
			vashiSTho api even Sage Vashishta, knows Rama. Here the word api 
			, even, is said to have been used to qualify Vashishta as an antagonist of Vishvamitra 
			in policy differences. 'Even my opponent, this Sage Vashishta, the descendent 
			of Goddess Saraswati and Brahma, and a brahmarSi, Absolute-knower, and 
			at whose instance I became a brahmarSi from raajarSi , is aware 
			of Rama...' is the argument of Vishvamitra, stressing his neutrality in seeking 
			Rama's help.

[Commentary] Still Vishvamitra tells that ye cheme tapasi sthitaaH , 'those sages 
			that are here who are rooted in ascesis' as in the vein of puruSasuukta 
			which says tasya dhiiraaH pratijaananti yonim. Vishvamitra's argument 
			is 'Sage Vashishta may take sides with you, because he is rajaguru , 
			the royal priest, while the others like Kaashyapa, Vaamadeva will tell you clearly, 
			as they have no leaning on your court.'

[Commentary] All said and done, King Dasharatha is still lingering for a reply. Seeing that 
			Vishvamitra further says, 'if you want to achieve renown, send Rama.' No father 
			rejoices that much when a son is birthed than on his achieving reputation. Dasharatha 
			is advised in the same way when saying yadi dharmalaabham, yasho laabham 
			'if you want renown through a worthy son, who will be renowned in all three worlds 
			by his coming with me, then you send Rama...'

[Commentary] Now Rama's reputation is going to be enhanced by Sage Vishvamitra in eliminating 
			demoness Tataka, in releasing Ahalya from her curse, breaking Shiva's bow, marriage 
			with Seetha, rebuffing Parashuraama etc. And also Vishvamitra leaves the decision 
			to Dasharatha, 'if only your ministers, clergy as well political, permit then 
			alone you send Rama with me...'

Shlok 15b- 16a: "If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown 
			on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. [1-19-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite 
			headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. [1-19-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for 
			ten days of the ritual without temporising. [1-19-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "I wish you to take decision as to how my ritual's time is not lapsed, and 
			let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve." Thus Vishvamitra 
			said to Dasharatha. [1-19-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: On saying those words that comprise fairness and meaningfulness that virtue-souled 
			great saint with great resplendence paused. [1-19-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21: On hearing the propitious words of sage Vishvamitra that best king Dasharatha 
			shuddered and swooned as he is muffled up with profound adversity, and after that 
			on regaining consciousness he sunk down in fear. [1-19-20b, 21]

Shlok 22: This way on hearing that word of the saint Vishvamitra which is explicitly slitting 
			his mind and heart that illustrious and noble-souled king Dasharatha then became 
			highly annoyed at heart, and flustered extremely in his throne. [1-19-22]



SARGA 20
------------------------------

[Text] On enquiring details about those dangerous demons that are ravaging sage's ritual, King Dasharatha 
refuses to send young Rama along with Sage Vishvamitra on many an account, and thus confronts 
the Sage's wrath.

Shlok 1: On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for 
a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. [1-20-1]

Shlok 2: ""Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him 
with the demons. [1-20-2]

[Commentary] This particular statement uunaSoDashavarSaH less than sixteen years, has evoked 
a spate of commentaries in deciding the age of Rama at this juncture of going along with Sage 
Viswamitra, i.e., at the time of his marrying Seeta and at the time of his exile to forests 
etc. His age is said to be twelve years as of now. And this is confirmed by Mareecha while 
advising Ravana, that 'as a boy of twelve Rama, killed my mother and brother, and hit me out' 
as at 3-38-6, uunadvaadashavarSaH Or, baalo dvaadashavarSo ayam as per 
other versions of the same verse.

[Commentary] Ramayana has some bearing on the number twelve. The Books or Kaanda-s are 6, half of twelve. 
The total verses are 24 thousand, two folds of twelve thousand. Rama is born in twelfth month. 
Vishvamitra's arrival, or better said as Seethaa-kalyaaNa , Seetha's marriage with 
Rama, is in the twelfth year. His stay in Ayodhya before crown prince ceremony and exile is 
for twelve years. The years of Rama's exile are twelve, plus two years stay in Panchavati, 
of the total fourteen years of exile. In Uttara Ramayana Seetha's exile in the hermitage of 
Valmiki is for twelve years. So on...

[Commentary] Some others said that because Rama has not yet attained all the sixteen phases like full moon, 
he is not a full-fledged person, chaaru SoDashakalaasahitaH Again in saying:
raajiivalochana lotus-eyed one - petals of lotuses close down by night, so Rama's 
eyelids too close by night for a boyish sleep. Then how can such a boy war with night-active 
demons? In answer to this Sage Vishvamitra uses the same wording in previous chapter at 1-19-18,
dasharaatram; raamam raajiivalocanam where the wording raajiivalocana 
is used by Vishvamitra in the sense that the petals of a lotus spread out on the first rays 
of sun. So also the very opening of the lotus-petal eyelids of Rama will eradicate the nightly 
menace of demons with his Omniscient Sun-Moon-Fire eyes, suuryachandraagnilochanaH 
, that can see even in night.

[Commentary] A Kshatriya of sixteen years age is unfit to war with any one, as he is still a childhood
baalaH aaSoDashaavarSaH . But Rama is under sixteen, and he is being requisitioned 
for war. Can he combat even if he is under aged? Yes, he can, says Govindaraja as per the
nyaya /syndrome, tejasaam hi na vayaH samiikShyate 'dextrous person's age 
is not to be reckoned' As such, though Rama appears to be under aged he can do wonders in 
eliminating the vice. This is again rounded off with Vishvamitra's wording in last chapter:
aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam raajiivalocanam.

Shlok 3: "Here is the full-fledged battalion, called akShouhiNii senaa , 
for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter 
those demons. [1-20-3]

[Commentary] One pankti row, is the first unit of ancient military, which consists of 1 chariot, 
1 elephant, 3 cavalry, and 7-foot soldiers. Multiples of this first unit become an akShouhiNii 
troop, which consists of 21,870 chariots and the same number of elephants, 65,610 cavalry, 
and 1,09,350 of foot soldiers.

Shlok 4: "Brave and daring are these soldiers of mine, and as experts in weaponry they are the appropriate 
ones to combat the hordes of demons, but, it will be ungentle of you to take Rama with you. 
[1-20-4]

Shlok 5: "I alone with bow in my hand can protect your ritual, and as long as I bear my lives so long 
I war with those nightwalkers staying in the van of war. [1-20-5]

Shlok 6: " I myself wish to come over there thereby the works of ritual will be well-guarded and unimpeded, 
but, taking Rama with you will be ungracious of you. [1-20-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "Why because, Rama is boy! And he is unschooled in his princely education; does he know the 
strengths and weaknesses of opponents - no; has he got the equipage of arsenal - no; has he 
any expertise in warfare - no; is he an equal to the demons - no; be that as it may, those 
demons definitely conduct a deceitful warfare, isn't it. [1-19-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Alienated from Rama I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, tigerly sage, hence taking 
Rama with you will be unjust. [1-20-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Otherwise, oh, Brahman with best vows, if you so wish to take Rama along with you, you lead 
him off along with me, and along with my four kinds of troops. [1-20-9b, 10a]

[Commentary] The four kinds of troops are: chariots, elephants, cavalry, and foot soldiers.

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Sixty thousand years have passed from my birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered 
at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate 
of you. [1-20-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "I will have exceptional affection for all of my four sons, isn't it, and among them Rama 
has a significance in the matter of his descent as an eldest son, hence taking Rama with you 
will be unjust of you. [1-20-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Oh, eminent sage, of what fortitude are those demons? Whose sons are they? Who are they? 
How is their size and shape? Also who protects all of them? [1-20-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, Brahman, how Rama, or my forces, or I myself have to retaliate those demons that are 
deceitful militants. [1-20-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: "Tell me all that, oh, god, how I have to carry on when warring with those evil minded demons, 
for the demons will be delirious by their audacity, isn't it..." Thus Dasharatha asked Vishvamitra 
insistently. On hearing those words Sage Vishvamitra replied this way. [1-20-14b, 15]

Shlok 16- 17a: "One born in Paulastya dynasty, an extremely mighty and exceedingly brave demon named Ravana 
is there, and he with the boon given by Brahma, and accompanied with many other demons is 
torturing the triad of worlds, contemptuously. [1-20-16, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Unequivocally that chief of demons is the brother of Kubera and the son of sage Vishravasa, 
thus we hear. [1-20-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: "That formidable Ravana is not a devastator of rituals by himself, even so, two very mighty 
demons called Mareecha and Subaahu will cause devastating hindrances to rituals, instigated 
by him." Thus Sage Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-20-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: Thus when he is said so by that sage Vishvamitra, then the king Dasharatha spoke to the sage, 
"I myself am not capable of standing against that evil minded Ravana, in truth, where is the 
question of deputing my young Rama to confront him? [1-20-20]

Shlok 21: "You are the knower of probity, such as you are, you may please bestow benevolence upon my 
boyish son, as well on a less fortunate one like me too, and as our mentor you are indeed 
a god of ours. [1-20-21]

Shlok 22: "Gods, demons, celestial beings like gandharva-s, yaksha-s, winged and reptile beings 
are incapable to bear the brunt of that Ravana in fight, why tell again about humans. [1-20-22]

Shlok 23- 24a: "But that Ravana depletes the valour of valorous opponents in a battle, oh, eminent sage, 
either with my entire forces, or with all my sons I am inadequate to grapple with all his 
forces, or with him, individually. [1-20-23, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "My boyish son is godlike and unfledged in warfare, oh, Brahman, and he is the one who alleviates 
me from punnama naraka the hell of sonless fathers... no, I cannot 
spare my son in anyway. [1-20-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: "Further, those saboteurs of your ritual namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are similar to Death-god 
and the descendents of the earliest demons and subverters of rituals, namely Sunda and Upasunda, 
no, I cannot spare my son, in any case. [1-20-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27: "Mareecha and Subaahu are well-trained and valorous ones, hence I will proceed with all my 
friendly forces to war with either of those two demons, otherwise, I along with all my relatives 
implore upon you for your exoneration in my failure to comply my own promises. [1-20-26b, 
27]

Shlok 28: Thus, by the incongruous talk of Dasharatha, the outstanding Brahman and son of Sage Kushi, 
namely sage Vishvamitra is overwhelmed with outrageous anger by his mentation, and that fire-like 
glorious sage looked like the ritual fire into which many inflammable oblations are offered, 
and which is drenched with a lot of clarified butter, whereby it is flaring up its tongues. 
[1-20-28]



SARGA 21
------------------------------

[Text] The ire of sage Vishvamitra is shown at king Dasharatha. To pacify sage Vishvamitra, 
			sage Vashishta intervenes and convinces king Dasharatha to send Rama with sage 
			Vishvamitra. While doing so, sage Vashishta enumerates the capabilities of sage 
			Vishvamitra, his knowledge of weaponry. Vashishta also suggests that all those 
			weapons will be given to Rama, if Rama is dispatched with Vishvamitra. At last, 
			Dasharatha agrees to send Rama.

Shlok 1: On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, 
			Vishvamitra wrathfully replied this sentence to the king. [1-21-1]

Shlok 2: "On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate 
			it now, undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty. 
			[1-21-2]

Shlok 3: "If this is worth while to you, oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and 
			you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy with your kinsmen." So said 
			Vishvamitra to the king. [1-21-3]

Shlok 4: When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth 
			trembled and the gods are scared. [1-21-4]

Shlok 5: On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, 
			Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these 
			words to the king. [1-21-5]

Shlok 6: "Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, 
			a staunch one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it 
			will be unapt of you to forsake ethics." [1-21-6]

Shlok 7: "In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence 
			adhere to your own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt 
			of you. [1-21-7]

Shlok 8: "Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word 
			results in the perdition to the merits of iSTaapuurta 
			Vedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, leave hold of Rama. [1-21-8]

[Commentary] In some Vedic rituals activates for social service are undertaken, and they are 
			known as iSTaapuurta rituals, in which digging wells, lakes and other 
			social facilities will be undertaken.

Shlok 9: "Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long 
			as Kushi's son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects 
			divine nectar. [1-21-9]

[Commentary] In heaven an unapproachable firewall encircles the vessel of ambrosia protecting 
			it from thieving by the demons.

Shlok 10: "He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect 
			among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis. [1-21-10]

Shlok 11: "He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other person is there in the 
			triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable 
			about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself. 
			[1-21-11]

Shlok 12: "While Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, can anybody from sages - no; immortals- no; demons 
			- no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together with the kinnaraa-s and great 
			reptile beings - no, they cannot know him. [1-21-12]

Shlok 13: "All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaashva 
			Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva 
			gave them to Vishvamitra when was ruling kingdom. [1-21-13]

Shlok 14: "Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati's daughters and her husband 
			Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, 
			and victory-oriented missiles. [1-21-14]

Shlok 15: "Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists 
			gave birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme. [1-21-15]

Shlok 16: "On getting a boon Jaya named wife of Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty 
			best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for the destruction of ungodly 
			beings. [1-21-16]

Shlok 17: "Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another fifty unassailable, 
			unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators. [1-21-17]

Shlok 18: "And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this 
			principled one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles. [1-21-18]

Shlok 19: "Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, 
			who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either that has happened 
			or that is happening. [1-21-19]

Shlok 20: "Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has this sort 
			of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama's accompanying 
			the sage will be unapt of you. [1-21-20]

Shlok 21: "This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, 
			but intending to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring 
			upon you. [1-21-21]

Shlok 21: Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded 
			by sage Vashishta's words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has 
			pronounced renown, that Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to 
			the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra. [1-21-22]



SARGA 22
------------------------------

[Text] King Dasharatha sends Rama and Lakshmana along with Sage Vishvamitra as requested 
			by the sage. In their course of travel, Sage Vishvamitra imparts a secret knowledge 
			to the young princes Rama and Lakshmana, called bala-atibala- 
			vidya-s, by practicing which nothing can wither their vigour and vitality.

Shlok 1: When Vashishta said that way king Dasharatha with an air of satisfaction personally 
			fetched Rama along with Lakshmana. [1-22-1]

Shlok 2: Rama is blessed for a propitious travel firstly by his mother Kausalya and then 
			by his father king Dasharatha, thereupon the royal priest Vashishta rendered Vedic 
			hymns blessing the journey, then Dasharatha well pleased in his heart of hearts 
			kissed his son Rama on forehead and entrusted him to Vishvamitra. [1-22-2, 3]

[Commentary] The mother is the first one to bless sons.

			maatR^ikR^itama~Ngalasya aavashyakataa vyatirekeNa anvayena ca suucitam

[Commentary] Duryodhana of Maha Bharata knows about this rule position and when he wanted to 
			gain victory over Pandava-s he approaches his mother Gandhari, seeking her blessings, 
			at first. vyatirekaH taavat paaNDavaan jetukaamo duryodhanaH -

			- dharmaakuutam When Duryodhana sought for his mother Gandhari's 
			blessings even for eighteen days, where eighteen is the particular number of Maha 
			Bharata, she said 'where there is virtue there will be victory'. Hence, mothers 
			are the first ones to bless sons in every enterprise, and here Rama's enterprise 
			as incarnate of Vishnu is commencing.

Shlok 5: Then on seeing the lotus-eyed Rama following Vishvamitra, dustless 
			and pleasant for touch breeze blew. [1-22-4]

Shlok 5: When the great-souled Rama forged ahead there occurred an abounding downpour of 
			flowers with the booming of divine drums, together with the boom and blare of 
			drums and conch-shells of Ayodhya. [1-22-5]

Shlok 6: Rama with jet-black hair-locks handling his bow followed Vishvamitra who walked 
			ahead, while Lakshmana handling his own bow followed Rama. [1-22-6]

Shlok 7: Rama and Lakshmana, with two quivers each and two bows in their hands, and making 
			all the ten directions of compass lambent followed Vishvamitra, as if three headed 
			serpents followed Vishvamitra, and with their highly dynamic physiques and spiritedness 
			they look as if like the Ashwin twin gods of unequal charm following Brahma, the 
			Forefather. [1-22-7]

[Commentary] Each one is having two quivers tied on each shoulder. Thus the upper portions 
			of the quivers with feathered shafts, with the tips of arrows inside, are giving 
			a picture of two more heads, on either side of the princes' heads. Thus Rama and 
			Lakshmana are appearing like three headed serpents. That is to say they are too 
			young with the size of their heads equalling the mouth of the quiver.

[Commentary] The meaning of As'vins from as'va a horse, Persian asp, Greek
			Î¹ÏÏÎ¿Ï Latin equus, Welsh *eck, is 
			Horsemen. They were twin deities of whom frequent mention is made in the Vedas 
			and the Indian myths. The As'vins have much in common with the Dioscuri of Greece, 
			and their mythical genealogy seems to indicate that their origin was astronomical. 
			They were, perhaps, at first the morning star and evening star. They are said 
			to be the children of the sun and the nymph As'vin, who is one of the lunar asterisms 
			personified. In the popular mythology they are regarded as the physicians of the 
			Gods. Gorresio/Griffith.

Shlok 8- 9- 10a: Those two youngsters with charming and bejewelled physiques are handling bows 
			and swords and their fingers have leathern covers. Both the unreprovable brothers 
			Rama and Lakshmana are highly resplendent and effulgent by their worth. While 
			they are following Vishvamitra they looked like the sons of Fire-god, namely Skanda 
			and Vishakha, following the great god with inscrutable potential, namely Shiva, 
			and thus the brothers have made Vishvamitra to shine forth in even pose with god 
			Shiva. [1-22-8, 9, 10a]

[Commentary] The Supreme Being that is resident like an atom. sthaa Being, aNum 
atom like. In every mobile or sessile being he is there. Here it is Shiva. Shiva's sons are 
two, one Ganesha and the other Kumara, of which Kumara is the Army General of Gods. According 
to Maha Bharata, Kumara is said to have become four in a split-second, known as 1- Skanda, 
2- Vishaakha, 3- Shaaka, 4- Naigamesha. Here the first two aspects of Kumara, namely Skanda 
and Vishaakha, are incorporated in simile to Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 10b- 11a: And on going one and half yojana distance Vishvamitra addressed Rama in a harmonious 
			voice calling, 'oh, Rama', on the southern riverbank of Sarayu. [1-22-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: " "Take water, my boy, and like that you receive a group of hymns,
			bala and atibala from 
			me, and let no time lapse. [1-22-11b, 12a]

[Commentary] Since the Vedic hymns cannot be taught after sunset, now it shall be evening time 
			before sunset, when oblations will be offered at sunset, and hence no time lapse 
			is envisaged. Govindaraja.

Shlok 12b- 13a: "On receiving these hymns neither tiredness nor fever, nor disfiguring of personality 
			can effect you, nor the demons can charge you either you are sleeping or unvigilant. 
			[1-11-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "As it is none whosoever on earth can equal you in dexterity, Rama, and by reciting 
			these hymns none can equal you in the three worlds. [1-22-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: "My dear Raghava, if bala atibala hymns are practised, oh, impeccable one, none 
			can equal you in the world by your handsomeness, calibre, erudition, by your discernment, 
			and even in replying or rebutting you. [1-22-14b, 15]

Shlok 16: "On receiving these two teachings there will be none similar to you, for bala 
			and atibala are the mothers of all knowledge. [1-22-16]

Shlok 17: "Oh, best one among men, Raghava, if you go on reciting bala and atiblala hymns, 
			my dear Rama, there will be no hunger or thirst to you. [1-22-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: "And if these twin teachings are practised an inestimable renown will also accrue, 
			oh, Raghu's legatee, these two hymns that possess brilliance are the daughters 
			of Forefather Brahma, and oh, Rama of Kakutstha, I intend to impart these hymns 
			to you, oh virtuous one, as you are the most eligible one, hence take the teachings 
			that are kept safe from the world. [1-22-18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Though all of these numerous qualities are undoubtedly available with you, that 
			too in abundance, yet these hymns if ascetically nurtured will yield various results." 
			Thus spoke Sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-22-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: Then Rama on touching water to purify himself received those teachings from the 
			contemplative soul Vishvamitra with gladness beaming on his face. [1-22-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: Rama, the one with marvellous valiance, on obtaining those teachings performed 
			all his duties of a student in respect of a teacher and then shone forth like 
			the thousand rayed sun on a cloudless sky of autumn. Then those three very happily 
			stayed on the riverbank of Sarayu for that night. [1-22-21b, 22]

[Commentary] Here gurukaaryaaNi , are the duties demanded of a true disciple towards 
			a guru, who is his mantra-aachaarya, teacher according hymns. Without 
			performing these duties the studentship remains unfulfilled. These works are fetching 
			food for teacher, arranging his bed, pressing his sore-legs called paadasamvaahana 
			, etc. Rama does these services to any elderly person, more so to his father as 
			at this canto 1-18-28.

[Commentary] Throughout this chapter Vishvamitra addresses Rama alone to learn the hymns. It 
			may not be construed that Lakshmana is eliminated or avoided but he said to be 
			one with Rama when it comes to education. Thus these hymn are imparted to Lakshmana 
			also, not to Rama alone.

Shlok 24: Though both Rama and Lakshmana slept on an undeserving grass bed, nestled by the 
			comfortable words of Vishvamitra that night is as though pleasant to the noteworthy 
			children of Dasharatha. [1-22-24]



Sage Vishvamitra is the Seer for Gayatri hymn. He is the same Sage to impart balaatibala 
hymns to Rama and Lakshmana. For those readers that are interested to know or to practice,

SARGA 23
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana proceeding with Vishvamitra sojourn in a hermitage at a place where River 
Ganga and River Sarayu are confluent. Once god Shiva with his third eye burnt down the physical 
entity of Manmatha, the Love-god, at this place.

Shlok 1: At dawn after that night the great saint Vishvamitra spoke to the legatees of Kakutstha, Rama 
and Lakshmana, those that are sleeping on a grass bed. [1-23-1]

Shlok 2: "Fortunate is Kausalya to beget you as her son Rama... get up oh, tigerly-man, eastern aurora 
is emerging, daytime tasks towards gods are to be performed." [1-23-2]

[Commentary] This is another celebrated verse chanted even today. So far Rama is a dear prince to his parents. 
But here, no less than Sage Vishvamitra said to have deified Rama in asking him to 'get up' 
from divine trance to undertake the human duties to eliminate evil, like the dawn of the sun 
eliminating the evil darkness. In other ancient manuscripts the same verse obtains as:

[Commentary] This early morning 'awakening' of Vishnu or his incarnates from divine trance is a common 
practice in Vaishnavaite tradition, and is followed even today, called suprabhaata sevaa 
, morning service to wake up.

[Commentary] At the rising of the sun as well as at noon certain observances, invocations, and prayers 
were prescribed which might under no circumstances be omitted. One of these observances was 
the recitation of the sAvitri, [Gayatri, so to say,] a Vedic hymn to the Sun of wonderful 
beauty - Gorresio.

[Commentary] For kausalyaa suprajaa raama Griffith says: 'High fate is hers who calls thee son: 
/ Arise, 'tis break of day /. And Gita Press has it as: Kausalya is blessed with a worthy 
son [in you.]

Shlok 3: On hearing the benign words of the sage those valorous and best ones among men got up, bathed, 
and on offering water oblation they meditated upon the supreme hymn, namely Gayatri. [1-23-3]

[Commentary] Rama and Lakshmana meditated upon Gayatri hymn as there is no hymn superior to it;
na gaayatryaaH param japyam and this is also the usual hymn for water oblation at 
dawn or dusk: sandhyaa vandana . sandhyaa is the time between the day and 
night when the stars or the sun are not visible.
aho raatrasya yaH sandhiH suuryanakShatravarjitaH Then this hymn is 
to be meditated placing her in ones own heart or amid the solar system.
gaayatriim samsmaret dhiimaan hR^idi vaa suuryamaNDale.

Shlok 4: On performing their dawn time duties those two stalwarts, Rama and Lakshmana, enthusiastically 
presented themselves before the ascetically rich sage Vishvamitra for further journey, duly 
venerating him. [1-23-4]

Shlok 5: Then on travelling some more distance those two great valiant ones, there they have seen the 
divine river that courses in three ways, namely Ganga, at the auspicious confluence of River 
Sarayu. [1-23-5]

[Commentary] River Ganga follows three courses, firstly in heavens, second on earth, and third into nether 
worlds. These episodes on the descent of Ganga to earth are narrated in the later part of 
this book, Bala Kanda.

Shlok 6: There they have seen the merited hermitage of sages with contemplative souls, and who are 
practising supreme ascesis for many thousand years. [1-23-6]

Shlok 7: On seeing that merited hermitage Rama and Lakshmana are highly pleased and said this word 
to that great-soul Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-7]

Shlok 8: "Whose hermitage is this merited one? Indeed who is the celebrity that lives therein? Oh, 
godly sage, we are interested to listen, and we are truly inquisitive about it." Thus they 
asked. [1-23-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing their words the eminent sage Viswamitra said smilingly, " whose hermitage is this 
in earlier times that may be listened." Thus Vishvamitra started to narrate. [1-23-9]

Shlok 10- 11: "When Love-god was with his body wise men used to call him Kama, the passion. At this place, 
that Love-god with his naughty intent braved god of gods Shiva who had been practising ascesis 
and who concentrated observantly, and who was returning after his marriage along with his 
followers, namely the Wind-gods, and that great soul Shiva disapprovingly roared at Love-god. 
[1-23-10, 11]

[Commentary] The meaning of kandarpa is one who is carnally prideful, i.e., he who takes pride 
in arousing lecherousness. And kaama is 'desire' the natural basic instinct of any 
animal, and the one which the sages and saints want to overcome, so they named Love-god from 
their point of view. In these verses the two words kR^itodvaaham , and their meaning 
as on marrying Parvati and going this way with his coterie etc., is held incongruous to other 
mythological episodes of Shiva's marriage with Parvati, and Manmatha's effort to enkindle 
love in Shiva. After marriage with Parvati, some argue, where is the question of Love-god's 
interference to inculcate love in Shiva. It is clear in RamaCharitaMaanas how this Shiva-Parvati 
marriage occurs. And some give the meaning like this: kR^ita where kR^i= karaNe 
udvaaham tu devesham = to actualise, marriage, only, of Shiva; gacChantam on 
going there, Love-god, samarudgaNam with Wind-gods and other deities; dharSayaamaasa 
started to attack Shiva. The Love-god on going there to that hermitage that is being described 
by Vishvamitra along with Wind-gods et al, with an intention to get the marriage of Shiva 
performed, assailed Shiva.

Shlok 12: "And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his 
limbs to fall down from his body. [1-23-12]

[Commentary] The word avadhyataH is otherwise said in other texts as avadagdhasya raudreNa cakShuSaa, 
to derive a clear meaning of 'burnt down,' because avadhyataH is just killing, slaying, 
whereas Shiva's third-eye truly burns down anything where even ashes do not remain. The critical 
editions have this as dagdhasya tasya raudreNa chakShuShA

Shlok 13: "There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by 
the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity. [1-23-13]

[Commentary] Manmatha and his wife Rati will have supremely exquisite physiques. At the very sight of Manmatha 
everybody used to become a prey to lasciviousness. So Shiva had to completely burn down that 
physical form of love, whereby only kaama, the mental desire, is remaining.

Shlok 14: Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is 
given up that is renowned as Anga province. [1-23-14]

Shlok 15: "This merited hermitage thus belongs to Shiva and, oh, brave Rama, these sages abiding in 
virtue are Shiva's disciples at one time, thus sin is unverifiable with them. [1-23-15]

[Commentary] This hermitage belongs to Love God or Shiva, tasya kaamasya sthaaNorvaa. Because 
Shiva is a god who controls Love-god, kaameshvara, this is Shiva's hermitage. The 
last verse again says it is Kaama's hermitage. And the sages practising ascesis in this hermitage,
puraa shiSyaa , are the old time disciples of Shiva. puurvakaalam aarabhya...santaanaparamparayaa 
shiSyaa. These sages are the progeny of the sages who long time back were 
the direct disciples of Shiva. Because these are the direct grandchildren of the direct disciples 
of Shiva, sin cannot touch them. ata 
eva paapam teShaam na vidyate | puurvam rudrashiShyaa api samprati tat shiShyakR^itam paapam 
na vidyate ityarthaH|| Govindaraja.

Shlok 16: "Let us stay for this night in this hermitage situated in between two meritorious rivers Ganga 
and Sarayu, oh, Rama with auspicious mien, tomorrow we will cross over the River Ganga. [1-23-16]

Shlok 17- 18a: "Let us all purify ourselves by taking our bath, performing our meditations, offering our 
daily oblations, and then let us enter this meritorious hermitage, thus our stay in here will 
be comforting to us." So said Vishvamitra to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-23-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: When they are discussing there the sages of that hermitage are highly gladdened to perceive 
them with their sixth-sense, and on approaching them enchantedly they offered water for hands 
and feet wash and then offered hospitality firstly to Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-18, 19]

Shlok 20: Afterwards those sages of that hermitage have accorded reception to Rama and Lakshmana, and 
applauded by Vishvamitra for their hospitality those sages have entertained Rama and other 
guests with myths and legends. [1-23-20]

Shlok 21: Those sages with concentrated minds and according to one's own aptitude have meditated upon 
the deity of sunset when it is sundown, followed by Rama and others. Then led into hermitage 
by those sages who are with pious commitments and who are dwelling there, Rama and others 
have very comfortably stayed in the precincts of Shiva's hermitage. [1-23-21]

Shlok 22: Staying very comfortably in the precincts of Kaama hermitage, 
then that virtuous sage Vishvamitra, saint the eminent, delighted the delightful princes with delighting stories.....[1-23-22]



SARGA 24
------------------------------

[Text] While crossing over the River Ganga, sage Vishvamitra sails them through its confluence with 
River Sarayu, which flows at their capital Ayodhya. The sage leads them to a deadly forest 
on the other bank of River Ganga and narrates about the ambushing nature of demoness Tataka, 
preparing him to kill her.

Shlok 1: Then, in the fresh of the morning those enemy destroyers, Rama and Lakshmana, arrived at the 
riverbank of Ganga keeping sage Vishvamitra ahead of them, which sage has just completed his 
ritualistic chores of dawn. [1-24-1]

Shlok 2: All those sages of Kaama's hermitage that are the great souls and scrupulous ones in their 
vows, have positioned an auspicious ferryboat within the reach in the river, and then they 
said to sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-2]

Shlok 3: "You may board the boat keeping the princes ahead of you, and we wish you to proceed on a 
prosperous route without the shift of time." So said the sages. [1-24-3]

Shlok 4: Sage Vishvamitra on saying 'it must be so,' to those sages and revering them in his turn, 
cruised the river that itself is cruising towards ocean, along with both the princes. [1-24-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: On coming to the midstream of water there Rama heard an unusual and increasing noise of gushy 
waters along with his younger brother, and that brilliant one Rama desired to know its significance. 
[1-24-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Rama then asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra in the midst of the river, "what is this turbulent 
sound sire, as though slashing water?" [1-24-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On hearing the inquisitive words of Raghava that virtue-souled sage Vishvamitra started to 
tell the significance of that sound. [1-24-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "On Mt. Kailash Brahma created a great lake at his will, oh, tigerly-man Rama, hence that 
is called Maanasa Lake. [1-24-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10- 11a: "That river which spontaneously flows out of that Maanasa Lake surrounds Ayodhya city is this 
one, the River Sarayu. Because this has originated from a lake, saraH, 
this is known as Sarayu. And because it flows from Brahma's Lake it is a merited river. This 
is the remarkable noise of such a Sarayu River in its coursing towards River Ganga, generated 
by the collision of their waters, and Rama, offer regards to these rivers, respectfully." 
So said Vishvamitra to the princes. [1-24-9b, 10, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: Offering their salutations to River Sarayu and Ganga those two most virtuous and agile footed 
princes proceeded further on reaching the southern riverbank. [1-24-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: On seeing a horrendous and uninhibited forest, Rama, the son of the best king Dasharatha asked 
the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, impenetrable is this forest fraught with swarms of crickets, brutish predators, and vultures, 
which are all horribly strident. [1-24-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Various vultures are screeching with fierce sonority, and tigers, wild boars, and elephants 
render this forest atypical. [1-24-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Indeed, what is this wretched forest that is dense with Dhava, Ashvakarna, Arjuna, Bilva, 
Tinduka, Patala, and Badari trees." Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-24-15b, 16a]

[Commentary] The botanical names of the trees mentioned in the text are Grislea Tormentosa, Shorea Robusta, 
Echites Antidysenterica, Bignonia Suaveolens, Aegle Marmelos, and Diospyrus Glutinosa. I have 
omitted the Kutaja (Echites) and the Tinduka (Diospyrus). Griffith.

Shlok 16b- 17a: The resplendent and the great saint Vishvamitra then said to Rama, "I will tell you, oh, my 
boy Rama, whose is this wretched forest. [1-24-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Once these were vast provinces, oh, best one among men, designed by gods and known as Malada 
and Karuusha. [1-24-17b, 18a]

[Commentary] The word malada is malam dyati khaNDayati iti malada that which abolishes 
excreta, but not filth itself. karuuSha is remover of hunger. 
If mortal hunger is there excreta will be there and then mortality of Indra is at stake. Hence 
if hunger is eliminated there will be nothing filthy. Once these provinces were such hunger 
removers equalling to heaven, but deteriorated in their heaven-on-earth attributes, owing 
to demoness Tataka.

Shlok 18b- 19a: "Once upon a time, oh, Rama, mortal impurities of filth and hunger completely stained Indra 
when he eliminated demon Vritra, as he committed the sin of killing of a Brahman, where the 
demon Vritra was incidentally a Brahman. [1-24-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "The gods and ascetically rich sages then started to bathe feculent Indra with their handy 
vessels for the riddance of his defilement. [1-24-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "On giving filth and hunger emerged out of the body of Mahendra here on the earth then the 
gods were gladdened. [1-24-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: "As and when Indra was without desecration and hunger as well, and thus purified, then gladdened 
about this place he gave it an unexcelled boon. [1-24-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "These provinces that bear the impurity of my body shall become resourceful and they shall 
attain renown in world as Malada and Karusha." Thus Indra gave boon to this place. [1-24-22b, 
23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "On observing the honour accorded by wise Indra to these places gods praised the controller 
of demon Paaka, namely Indra saying, 'splendid, splendid it is.' [1-24-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "For a long time these habitations Malada and Karuusha were affluent, oh, enemy subjugator 
Rama, and people were happy with wealth and provisions. [1-24-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26- 27a: "Later at sometime, a yaksha female who is a guise changer at her wish, possessor of the strength 
of a thousand elephants, wife of clever Sunda, and she whose son is demon Mareecha, the 
one equal to Indra in his bravery, prevailed here, let you be safe Rama. [1-24-25b, 26, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: "That demon Mareecha is round shouldered, huge headed, cavernous mouthed, and gigantic bodied 
one, and he is always terrifying the people. [1-24-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: "And Raghava, that malevolent Tataka is always destroying the inhabitations at Malada and 
Karusha. [1-24-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: "She lives about one and half yojana distance from here, and by which reason this became the 
forest of Tataka, owing to her gruesome activities, for that reason only a headway is to be 
made, to eradicate her and her activities. [1-24-29b, 30a]

[Commentary] This verse also means 'where there is the forest of Tataka there we have to go.' The above 
is another shade of that verse.

Shlok 30b- 31a: "Depending upon the strength of your own self-confidence you have to eradicate this evildoer, 
and assigned by me you have to make this province free from thorniness. [1-24-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] Great persons accomplish their deeds by their self-confidence, kriyaasiddhiH sattve bhavati 
mahataam, nopakaraNe not by their hardware.

Shlok 31b- 32a: "Indeed, none is able to enter this sort of province, Rama, destroyed by the hazardous 
and invincible unearthly being who turned into a demoness, namely Tataka, hence you have to 
make the provinces habitable. [1-24-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32: "As to how that ghoulish Tataka destroyed this entire forest, rendering it as a devastated 
place, without refraining from it even today, all that is narrated." So said Vishvamitra to 
Rama. [1-24-32]

[Commentary] The epithets used in epic may be on the increase from now, and 
they may not be construed as redundant foot fillers. All have implicit meanings and they can be 
understood with the help of commentaries. As this work cannot include voluminous commentaries, many 
of the meanings of epithets as said by commentators are not incorporated. This bypassing will not 
effect the ordinary narration. For e.g., the meaning to the words munipungava, narashaarduula
will be 'the eminent saint' 'tigerly man'. And trying to obtain a squeezed meaning from them 
would be futile, without resorting to some commentary. So also, there are words like indra, 
candra, simha, shaarduula, naaga, vR^iSabha, pungava which when suffixed to vocatives will mean 
'best, choicest, excellent' etc., as per simha-shaarduula-naagaadyaaH pumsi shreSTaarthagocharaaH 
. But commentators have explained why that character is 'best or excellent, or a lion' 
at that juncture. For e.g., dharmaatmaathe apparently usual epithet in Ramayana has many 
meanings like â 1] one whose life is dharma; 2] one whose body is dharma incarnate; 3] one whose 
soul is filled with dharma; 4] one whose entity itself is dharma â so on, basing on the thesaurus of
aatmathat say as: aatmaa yatna-dhR^iti-svaanta-svabhaava-paramaatmaasu jiiva-buddhi- 
shariireSu..

[Commentary] So also, more than often Seetha will be referred as Vaidehi or 
Maithili in Aranya Kanda. Some details about it are incorporated in that book. Wherever possible 
those niceties will be included subject to availability of commentaries, which commentaries have 
already became 'the flowers in the sky.'

[Commentary] Hence, without trying to squeeze meaningless meanings, and leaving this aspect to pundits and 
researchers, and as this work cannot be stuffed with those intricacies, henceforth the meanings of 
epithets are said simply, and at times ignored also. This may please be kept in view while reading.



SARGA 25
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra narrates the birth, marriage and curse of demoness Tataka, and bids Rama 
to eliminate her menace without any hesitation of killing a female, for she is atrocious towards 
the society.

Shlok 1: On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the tigerly man Rama 
replied him with estimable words. [1-25-1]

Shlok 2: "It is said that yaksha's strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how 
then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants? [1-25-2]

Shlok 3- 4: On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence 
to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, 
"Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the 
bestowal of a boon. [1-25-3, 4]

Shlok 5: "Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout 
conduct performed a great ascesis. [1-25-5]

Shlok 6: "Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who 
is renowned by the name of Tataka. [1-25-6]

Shlok 7: "Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly 
remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous. 
[1-25-7]

Shlok 8: "When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to 
Jambha's son Sunda as wife. [1-25-8]

Shlok 9: "Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who 
by curse became a demon. [1-25-9]

Shlok 3: "But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya's curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate 
that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha. [1-25-10]

Shlok 11- 12a: "With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him 
away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya 
firstly cursed Mareecha saying, 'you will attain demon-hood.' [1-25-11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13: "Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, 'forthwith divested of this form 
of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, 
face contorted, and shape monstrous.' [1-25-12b, 13]

Shlok 14: "Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious 
province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered. [1-25-14]

Shlok 15: "She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall 
eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows. [1-25-15]

Shlok 16: "Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, 
Raghu's legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her. [1-25-16]

Shlok 17: "Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since 
a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society. [1-25-17]

Shlok 18: "For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either 
it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying. [1-25-18]

Shlok 19: "To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, 
the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn't it. 
[1-25-19]

Shlok 20: "Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the 
daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven't we. [1-25-20]

Shlok 21: "And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya's mother 
when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra. [1-25-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females 
who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, 
by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her." Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama 
regarding Tataka's elimination. [1-25-22]

[Commentary] This is a much
  discussed topic in Ramayana. Rama's adventures start with the killing of a female. While
  scriptures say that killing a female is sinful, is this killing of a female righteous or wrongful
   is the topic for discussion. It is said in answer that there is no harm to dharma since
  unrighteousness is eliminable though existing in the form of a female.
  duShTastriivadhe doSho naastiiti shaastreNa na anyena - dharmaakuutam ||
And ViShNu Purana
  says that eliminating one evildoer for the sake of many innocent is neither sin nor a crime  of
  course, to the kings and rulers: yasmin atra
  nidhanam praapte duShTakaariNi | bahuunaam bhavati kShemaH tasya puNyaprado vadhaH || - viShNu
  puraana 1-13-73-74
For the sake many, that too defenceless rural people, it is the duty
  of the king to eliminate whether it is a male or a female if involved in atrocities: 
  dharmaarthapuurvakam taaTakaavadhe doSho naasti -   --  puNyam 
	eva bhaviShyati iti taatparyeNa maharShivishvaamitreNa uktam | idaaniimtanairapi

SARGA 26
------------------------------

[Text] Rama encounters his first problem-female demoness Tataka, also called as Taadaka, 
and eliminates her at the orders of sage Vishvamitra. This is a crucial test put 
to Rama by Vishvamitra in ascertaining whether Rama is the follower of dharma through 
elder men's orders or not. Rama eradicates Tataka basing on his own self-confidence.

Shlok 1: On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best 
man's son who is firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage. 
[1-26-1]

Shlok 2: "Upon my father's order, upon my honour to my father's word, and looking upon this 
as the word of sage Kushi's son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented. 
[1-26-2]

[Commentary] The third consideration is 'teacher's words' itarairapi gurushaasane sati avishankayaadharmyam 
api tad uktam avashyam kartavyam iti suucitam - dharmaakuutam hence, 
Rama cannot be heedless of the words of both his father and teacher.



"What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, 
that word too cannot be disregarded. [1-26-3]

[Commentary] Dasharatha bade Rama to do whatever assigned by Vishvamitra. Here Vishvamitra is 
assigning something ambiguous. Hence the dilemma between two instructions of two 
elderly people, and thus scriptures and practise confuse the young.

Shlok 4: "Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according 
as the follower of father's words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma 
scholar, such as your are, without a doubt. [1-26-4]

[Commentary] Here Rama is in the same predicament as Arjuna in Maha Bharata. Arjuna's dilemma 
is to kill his own relatives, where Rama's is to kill a female at this juncture. 
What Krishna preaches in entire Bhagavad Gita is told in nutshell by sage Vishvamitra, 
i.e., 'do your duty as a Kshatriya, the ruling class, and protect virtue and eradicate 
vice, whether it is in the form of females or relatives.' atha vishvaamitro 
guruH - tasya vacanam avicaareNa kartavyam - evam sati dasharathena api - kaushiko

ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava. [1-26-29b, 30a]

[Commentary] These are the sons like missiles of Krishaashva Prajaapati. About them, the divine 
weaponry and their birth, c.f. 21st sarga/chapter, verse 10 to 20.

Shlok 30b- 31a: "Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver 
of those missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods. 
So said gods to Vishvamitra. [1-26-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned

we will go to that hermitage of mine. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-26-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: On listening sage Vishvamitra's words, Dasharatha's son Rama, comfortably stayed 
that night there in that forest of Tataka. [1-26-34]

Shlok 35b: On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and 
it shone forth like the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha. 
[1-26-35b, c]

Shlok 36: Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete 
elimination of yaksha's daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage 
only to be awakened by the next day's sunrise. [1-26-36]

[Commentary] The materialists view this episode as a function of Rama in eradicating natural 
calamities like dust storms, pellet storms in an uncultivable land, on the line 
of the episode of Ahalya. In this episode Rama's discipline is also tested. Whether 
he simply follows what is instructed or whether he uses his own discretion, is the 
topic here. Rama coupled both and eradicates Tataka, tough he doubts for a while 
whether to eliminate a female.

prathamataH kriyate â dharmaakuutam

[Commentary] This is required for the endowment of deadly missiles 
to Rama in coming chapters. Hence Vishvamitra asks Rama to depend upon his own self-confidence 
to undertake this deed as at 1-24-30b, 31a. On satisfying with the eligibility of 
Rama to receive missiles with this episode, Vishvamitra accords those deadly weapons 
later.

			The weaponry is categorised mainly into two types. One is
			shastra - a handheld weapon like sword, 
			lance or mace. The other is astra - a projectile 
			missile invoked by reciting hymns. This chapter lists out those missiles 
			that are given to Rama and in next chapter an account of some counter-attack 
			missiles, called upasamhaaraastra-s is 
			given which can be used to nullify the enemy's missiles. In the endnote 
			of this chapter some verses describing the nature of
			astra-s are incorporated.

Shlok 1: Then, on staying that night there in Tataka forest, on the next day 
			morning the greatly renowned sage Vishvamitra, smilingly and wording 
			sweetly spoke to Rama. [1-27-1]

Shlok 2: "I am highly pleased with you, oh, illustrious prince Rama, let safety 
			be with you, I will now give you all of the divine missiles in utmost 
			fondness of mine. [1-27-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: "I am going to accord all of those divine missiles by which scores of 
			gods, demons, or even from gandharva-s, uragaa-s and the like, or even 
			earthlings are dominated, humbled down and conquered in war. Let safety 
			be with you. [1-27-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5- 6- 7a: "Raghava, I am going to give the highly divine Danda disc [Punisher 
			disc]; next, oh, best one among men, Dharma disc [Virtue-disc,] and 
			like that kaala disc [Time-disc]; then oh, brave one, Vishnu disc; similarly 
			oh, dextrous Rama, Indra disc and Thunderbolt missile; the best trident 
			pertaining to Shiva; the missile called Brahma-shira [Brahma-crest]; 
			the missile called the Aishiika missile [Grass-Blade missile,] and that 
			way oh, Raghava, I am going to give the unexcelled and highly formidable 
			missile called Brahma missile. [1-27-4b, 5, 6, 7a]

[Commentary] aiSiika missile is dried blade of grass, which by invoking with hymns 
			will become a projectile weapon. Rama uses on Kakasura. In Mahaa Bharata 
			Ashvatthaama also uses this at the final stage of war, which Krishna 
			nullifies.

Shlok 7b- 8a: "Oh manly tiger prince Rama, I am going to accord two maces that are 
			brilliant by their radiance called, the Modaki, [the Beater,] and Shikhari, 
			[the Tower of Protection.] [1-27-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Oh, Rama, like that I will be giving three nooses called Dharma paasha 
			and kaala-paasha and Varuna paasha, [Virtue noose and Time noose, Rain 
			god's noose] as well as an unequalled missile called Varuna astra, Rain-god's 
			missile. [1-27-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Oh, Raghu's scion, I will also give two projectile bolts, one called 
			shushka [The Drier] and the other aardra [The Drencher] and even 
			the missiles of Pinaaka and that of Narayana, [the missiles of god Shiva 
			and Narayana] I will give. [1-27-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Oh, impeccable Rama, thus a well-known missile shikhari [The Tower] 
			and another the fond of Fire-god known as prathama [The Blower] and 
			a missile of Air-god too, I will be giving. [1-27-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Oh, Raghava of Kakutstha-s, I will give you two missiles named Haya-shira 
			[The Horse-head] and Krouncha [The Wrester] and two Impellers, one 
			presided over by the power of Vishnu, and the other by the power of 
			Rudra. [1-27-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "I will be giving all those weapons that are wielded by demons, namely 
			the deadly Pounder named Kankaalam, and Rods named as Kapaalam and Kankanam, 
			for the elimination of those very demons. [1-27-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, mighty armed son of the best king, I am giving a great missile 
			named Vaidyadhara by its name, and a gem of sword named Nandana. [1-27-13b, 
			14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Thus, the missile which is very much liked by Gandharva-s, namely Mohana, 
			[The Stupefier,] the missile called Prasvapana [The Inducer of Sleep,] 
			and the gentle Prashamana [The Pacifier of enemy's anger.] [1-27-14b, 
			15a]

Shlok 15b- 16- 17: "Oh, highly fortunate Rama, take these missiles namely, varshaNa, [the 
			Rainer,] shoshana [the Drainer,] santaapana [the Humidifier,] vilaapana 
			[the Weep-inducer,] and oh, prince, an unassailable intoxicator and 
			a dear missile of Manmatha, namely Mohana [The Intoxicator,] and another 
			the fond missile of gandharva-s namely maanava by its name, [The Humane 
			missile,] and oh, tigerly man, a missile dear one to pishaaca-s, monsters, 
			namely paishaca [The Monster missile.] [1-27-15, 16, 17]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19- 20: "Oh, manly-tiger Rama, greatly powered taamasa and saumana missiles, 
			the indomitable missiles like samvarta, mausala, satya, and then the 
			maaya-maya missile; like that oh, mighty armed Rama, a solar missile 
			the sequestrator of others' brilliance namely teja-prabha; next, the 
			missile of Moon-god named shishira [The Cooler]; and a very deadly missile 
			of tvaSTa namely sudaamana; and even the dangerous missile of bhaga 
			namely shita-iSu, these and the maanava missile of Manu, the earliest 
			ruler of mankind, I will be giving. [1-27-17b, 18, 19, 20]

Shlok 21: "These missiles are, oh, dextrous prince, disguise-wizards, greatly 
			powered, and highly providential ones, oh, Rama, you may take them forthwith." 
			So said sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-27-21]

Shlok 22: That pre-eminent sage Vishvamitra on performing his personal holy depuration 
			then gave the assortment of extraordinary hymns to Rama facing eastward. 
			[1-27-22]

Shlok 23: The comprehension of which invoking hymns of the missiles is impossible 
			even to gods with their sections and subsections of procedures, that 
			Brahman dedicated such hymns to Raghava. [1-27-24]

Shlok 24: While that intelligent saint Vishvamitra chanted the hymns, all of those 
			highly venerable missiles came nigh and stood accessible to Raghava 
			in their astral form. [1-27-24]

Shlok 25- 26a: All of those highly obliging missiles in astral bodies, gladdening to 
			come under the aegis of Rama, then spoke to him making palms-fold, "here 
			are your thralls, Sire, we are here to accomplish whatever you bid us 
			to do, let safety be with you." So said the deities presiding over the 
			missiles to Rama. [1-27-25]

Shlok 26b- 27: On receiving them with a pleased heart, then Rama patted them with his 
			palm, and that Rama of Kakutstha-s also spoke this way to those mightily 
			forceful missiles in ethereal bodies saying, "you may manifest yourselves 
			in my cognisance whenever I need you," and he motivated them to take 
			leave and to come back at his beck and call. [1-27-26b, 27]

Shlok 28: That highly resplendent Rama revered sage Vishvamitra with a thankful 
			heart and readied himself for further journey. [1-27-26]

[Commentary] There are some verses that depict the nature 
of these astra-s. A few of them are given under. Though we may not actually acquire 
a projectile power with these verses, they may at least detail what these missiles 
are. The source of these verses is untraceable, but they are said to be in puraaNaa-s, 
and Shiva informs Sage Narada, about the missiles as below:

[Commentary] "It contains air, fire and cosmic poison, 
two goat-like fangs, full of poison, weighty, emits air, contains mercury, fiery, 
sparkling, sky is filled with air, enemy-killing, greatly radiant and it is projected 
with three hymns, Gayatri at its centre, it is known as brahma-astra



SARGA 28
------------------------------

[Text] Rama requests sage Vishvamitra for endowing annulment missiles, besides 
			projectile ones that have been accorded in the previous chapter. Sage 
			Vishvamitra accords them, and while they are journeying further, they 
		
			chance to see a picturesque forest on their way and Rama enquires about 
			it.

Shlok 1: On becoming personally purified Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha-s, 
			received the missiles, and then on their way he is now speaking to Sage 
			Vishvamitra with a pleasant face. [1-28-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, godly sage, I have taken the missiles and became unassailable even 
			for gods, but oh, eminent sage, I wish to know the annulment of missiles 
			too." So said Rama to the sage. [1-28-2]

Shlok 3: When Rama of Kakutstha said thus, next that resolute, well-averred and 
			purified sage of eminence Vishvamitra imparted the knowledge of annulment 
			missiles. [1-28-3]

Shlok 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9- 10: "Oh, Raghava, take these radiant missile-children of Krishaasva from 
			me, namely Satyavanta, Satyakeerti, Dhristha, Rabhasa, Pratihaaratara, 
			Paraanmuka, Avaanmukha, Lakshya, Alakshya, Dhridhanaabha, Sunaabha, 
			Dashaaksha, Shatavaktra, Dashasheersha, Shatodara, Padmanaabha, Mahaanaabha, 
			Dundunaabha, Svanaabha, Jyotisha, Shakuna, Nairaashya, Vimala, Yaugandhara, 
			Vinidra, Daitya, Pramadhana, Suchibaahu, Mahaabaahu, Nishkali, Viruchi, 
			Saarchirmaali, Dhritirmaali, Vrittiman, Ruchira, Pitrya, Saumanasa, and 
			also thus Vidhoota, Makara, are two of them...Karaveerakara, Dhana, 
			Dhaanya, Kaamaroopa, Kaamaruchi, Moha, Aavarana, and thus Jrimbhaka, 
			Sarvanaabha, Varana... and these are the guise changing wizards and you 
			are the eligible one to handle these missiles, let safety be with you." 
			Thus Vishvamitra gave missiles to Rama. [1-28-4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Shlok 11- 12- 13: Gladdening in his heart of hearts Rama of Kakutstha received the annulment 
			missiles saying, "Agreed! Sire!" Those missiles are with radiantly divine 
			bodies, appealing and endowing bliss. Some are fire-like, some smoke-like, 
			and some moon-like and some sun-like, and such as they are, some of 
			them holding out their hollowed palms, and some with palms adjoined 
			melodiously spoke to Rama saying, "here we are, oh, tigerly man, what 
			can we do for you." [1-28-11, 12, 13]

Shlok 14: "While remaining in my memory you assist me as and when needed, and 
			till then you may go away as you wish," thus that legatee of Raghu-s said 
			to those deities of annulment missiles. [1-28-14]

Shlok 15: Saying "it will be done that way" to Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha-s, 
			also on performing circumambulation to him and then on taking his consent 
			those deities have gone away as they have come. [1-28-15]

Shlok 16: After learning the nullifying missiles and then while proceeding on 
			the walkway Raghava asked the great sage Vishvamitra with sweet and 
			soft words. [1-28-16]

Shlok 17- 18: "What is this cloudlike picturesque thicket shining forth not very far 
			away on this side of mountain, with animals spreading over it, and embellished 
			with numerous kinds of birds that have pleasant callings it is highly 
			soul-delighting, thus, my inquisitiveness is growing very much to know 
			it, what is this, really! [1-28-17, 18]

Shlok 19- 20a: "By the nature of happy environs at this place, oh, eminent sage, I 
			understand that we have come out of the extremely alarming forest of 
			Tataka, but oh, god, whose hermitage's threshold is this, kindly tell 
			me all. [1-28-19]

Shlok 20b- 21- 22: "Oh, great saint, where are those murderers of Brahmans? Oh, venerable 
			one, at which place those evil minded sinners and evildoers will be 
			coming to hinder your ritual? And where, oh, Brahman, I have to safeguard 
			your ritual ceremonies, and demons too are to be eliminated? Oh, eminent 
			sage, what is that place? I would like to hear all of it." Rama asked 
			Vishvamitra in that way. [1-28-20b, 21, 22]



SARGA 29
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana inquisitively enquired into the Siddhaashrama, 
			Accomplished Hermitage in the earlier chapter for which Sage Vishvamitra 
			informs about the heritage of that hermitage for it once belonged to 
			Vishnu in Vaamna incarnation. Vishvamitra narrates about it and how 
			Vaamna, a dwarfish ascetic boy eradicated evil on earth. It is a suggestion 
			to Rama from Sage Vishvamitra to do likewise in this incarnation of Rama also.

Shlok 1: When that matchlessly illustrious Rama has asked for details, that highly 
			resplendent sage Vishvamitra started to narrate about that forest to 
			Rama. [1-29-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "Here, oh, dextrous Rama, he who is worshipped by gods and who has got 
			outstanding ascesis that Vishnu resided here in the pursuit of practising 
			ascesis and yoga for good many years, likewise for a hundred eras. [1-29-2, 
			3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: "This is the erstwhile hermitage of great-souled Vaamana renowned as 
			Accomplished hermitage, why because the sage with supreme ascesis Kaashyapa 
			got accomplishment to such of his ascesis there only. [1-29-3b, 4a]

[Commentary] This is firstly the hermitage of Vishnu before taking up Vaamna incarnation. 
			Later the incarnate Vaamna also practised asceticism here. Thus, this 
			hermitage belongs to both Vishnu and Vaamna, and on such an analogy 
			this even belongs to Rama at the present time, so says Vishvamitra at 
			24th verse below.

Shlok 4b- 5: "In the meantime, when Vishnu was in his asceticism in this hermitage, 
			the son of King Virochana, namely Bali, has completely conquered all 
			the assemblages of gods together with Indra and his coterie called Wind-gods, 
			and ruling that kingdom where that hermitage is there, he has become 
			renowned in all the three worlds for his magnanimity. [1-29-4b, 5]

[Commentary] Bali is generally addressed Bali Chakravatri, Bali, The Emperor, for 
			his grand benevolence. He is the grand son of Prahlaada, who in turn 
			is the son of greatest demon king, HiraNyakashapa, who was eliminated 
			by Vishnu, in His Nara-simha, Man-Lion incarnation.

Shlok 6: "That great mighty chief of demons Bali then conducted a very grand 
			Vedic ritual. But when Bali is conducting that ritual remaining as its 
			officiator all the gods personally approached Vishnu, keeping Fire-god 
			ahead of them, just here in this hermitage and they spoke to him. [1-29-6]

Shlok 7: " 'Oh, all-pervading god Vishnu, Bali the son of Virochana is conducting 
			an unsurpassed Vedic ritual, before the completion of which our own 
			mission, say the task of gods, is to be achieved completely. [1-29-7]

Shlok 8: " 'Whoever the supplicant might be and from wherever he might be coming, 
			but if one approaches and supplicates to him he is donating that in 
			as is where is condition, whatever is supplicated and wherever it might 
			be. [1-29-8]

Shlok 9: " 'As such, oh, Vishnu, you may effectuate the most suitable merited 
			deed for the welfare of gods on resorting to your illusory power, Vishnu 
			Maya, and on assuming the form of a dwarf to deal with Emperor Bali.' 
			Thus gods appealed to Vishnu. [1-29-9]

Shlok 10: "In the meanwhile, oh Rama, he whose brilliance is similar to ritual 
			fire, who will be with his wife Lady Aditi, who is resplendent with 
			his own vitality, that godly sage Kaashyapa on completing his asceticism 
			along with Lady Aditi started to eulogise the boon giver and the eliminator 
			of demon Madhu, namely Vishnu." Thus Vishvamitra is narrating to Rama. 
			[1-29-10, 11]

[Commentary] The ascetic practises conducted along with wife are said to yield best 
			results, in the case of a desired object of that couple's interest. 
			Therefore, Dasharatha also conducted the ritual to beget progeny along 
			with his wives. Here Sage Kaashyapa conducted his austerities along 
			with wife Aditi.

Shlok 12: " 'Oh, Supreme Person, you are abounding with asceticism, aggregate 
			of asceticism, the aspect of asceticism, and the very soul of asceticism, 
			such as you are, I am able to see you with the well practised asceticism 
			of mine. [1-29-12]

[Commentary] The word 'tapaH' also means j~naana, gnosis, knowledge, intellect, spirit, 
			as such it is oriented that way and said as, "oh, Vishnu, you are abounding 
			with intellect, aggregate of intellect, the only aspect of intellect..." 
			etc.

Shlok 13: " 'In your physique I am seeing this entire universe, oh, god, and you 
			are without a beginning and indefinable, and in you I am taking shelter.' 
			Sage Kaashyapa praised Vishnu in this way. [1-29-13]

[Commentary] This is the concept of vishvaruupa, Physique of the Universes, 
			which Krishna shows to Arjuna in Maha Bharata at the time of telling 
			Bhavad Gita.

Shlok 14: Vishnu is gladdened for the devotion of sage Kaashyapa who is absolved 
			of any blemish in his ascesis, and then Vishnu said this to, "You may 
			seek a boon as you are boon-worthy, I opine that you are a preferred 
			one to me, let safety be with you." Thus Vishnu said to Kaashyapa. [1-29-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: On hearing the word of Vishnu sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mariicha 
			said, "oh, god the accorder of boons, as you are pleased with us it 
			will be apt of you to bestow the boon besought by Lady Aditi and the 
			gods, oh, lord with lofty vows, for which boon I am also supplicating 
			to you, following them. [1-29-15, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17: " 'Oh, god, oh, sinless one, you may please attain the sonship of Lady 
			Aditi and myself, oh, dispenser of demons, it will be apt of you to 
			render help to gods who are agonised in the anguish owing to the predominance 
			of Emperor Bali, by becoming the younger brother of Indra. [1-29-16b, 
			17]

Shlok 18: " 'Oh, god of gods, as the works of my austerities are accomplished 
            here, by your grace this hermitage will be renowned by the name Siddhaashram, 
            Hermitage of Accomplishment, hence oh god, arise from here to 
			become my son.' So said sage Kaashyapa to Vishnu. [1-29-18]

[Commentary] The wording siddhe karmaNi is interpreted in two ways. One 
			in respect of Vishnu who is practising asceticism there, as His austerities 
			are accomplished here in accepting request of gods as well as that of 
			Sage Kaashyapa. The other, in respect of Kaashyapa who is seeking the 
			boon, and if Vishnu accords the boon to incarnate Himself as Vaamna 
			in the womb of Aditi, the austerities of Kaashyapa are also accomplished. 
			Since the deeds of Supreme God are not accomplished with mere austerities, 
			but by eliminating the evil, the concept of siddhe karmaNi 
			is appropriate in respect of Sage Kaashyapa. In any way, this hermitage 
			is an Accomplished one for gods, for sages, and for Supreme Divinities, 
			in taking a foothold to eliminate the evil on earth.

Shlok 19: "That great resplendent Vishnu then adopting a semblance of a dwarf 
			emerged from Aditi, and that dwarfish ascetic boy approached Emperor 
			Bali, the son of Virochana." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-29-19]

Shlok 20- 21: "That dwarf ascetic boy Vaamana begged and received a space that can 
			be covered in three strides, but strode all the three worlds in those 
			three steps for the purpose of saving worlds, as he is interested in 
			the welfare of all the worlds. Vishnu gave the earth back to Indra restraining 
			Emperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great resplendent Vishnu made 
			the three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. [1-29-20, 
			21]

[Commentary] The myth is that Vaamna, the dwarfish ascetic boy, approaches Emperor 
			Bali and begs of him for a space enough to place his three dwarfish 
			foot-steps. While all around that ritual hall of Bali laugh at this 
			boy's request, Bali comes to know who this dwarfish boy is. Though known 
			to be Vishnu in this incarnation, without deviating from his vow of 
			according charities in 'as is where is condition', Bali accords that 
			much space to the boy. Then Vaamna places one dwarfish foot on this 
			globe and the entire globe is covered with it. Vaamna then asks Bali 
			where to put the second foot. Bali shows heavenward, which heavenly 
			worlds are conquered by Bali and are under his control at that time. 
			Vaamana places his second dwarfish foot on all the heavenly worlds covering 
			all of them. Then again, Vaamana asks Bali as to where the third foot-space 
			is. Bali shows his head to place the third foot. Vaamana places his foot 
			on this third foot-space, i.e., on Bali's head and starts to trample 
			him to paataala-loka, nether worlds. At the time of donating 
			the charity, while Bali is pouring water oblation into the hands of 
			Vaamana, Sage Shukraachaarya, the demon's high priest, knowing this dwarf 
			boy to be Vishnu, enters the nozzle of the water pot so that the donation 
			water may not fall into the hands of the boy, thus to fail the donation. 
			Knowing that the sage is in the nozzle of the water-pot, Vaamana pierces 
			the nozzle with a straw of darbha, sacred grass-blade, thus piercing 
			one eye of Sage Shukraachaarya. From then on, this sage has become one-eyed 
			sage, symbolically meaning that he eyes on one side only, namely on 
			the side of demon's welfare. Vaamana places his third step on the head 
			of Emperor Bali and subjugates him to netherworlds, freeing the other 
			worlds from his rule. However, Vishnu blesses Bali to be deathless, 
			though subdued into netherworlds, and to become Indra in the coming 
			manvantara-s, eras. Then on Vishnu is eulogised as Trivikrama, tri- 
			vi-krama three, verily, paced - surpassing, one who surpasses all 
			the three worlds in three strides.

Shlok 22: "This hermitage which at one time is presided by Vishnu, is an eradicator 
			of stress, either the stress and strain caused by the evil on earth, 
			or the stress of going through the cycle of birth and death, thus this 
			hermitage is an accorded of salvation, and I am also beneficed with 
			this hermitage owing to my devotion to Vaamana. [1-29-22]

Shlok 23: "Demons causing obstacles, oh, tigerly man Rama, will be arriving at 
			that hermitage and there alone those demons with evil pursuit are to 
			be eliminated. [1-29-23]

Shlok 24: "Rama, we now go to the unexcelled hermitage of Accomplishment, oh, 
			dear one, as to how this hermitage belongs to me, this also belongs 
			to you." Thus Vishvamitra said to Rama. [1-29-24]

[Commentary] This hermitage is my benefice now for I am practising my asceticism 
			here, but originally this belongs to you because you have practised 
			your asceticism here in this hermitage as Vishnu, even earlier to your 
			Vaamana incarnation.' Rama Tilaka.

Shlok 25: So saying that great sage Vishvamitra is highly gladdened to lead Rama 
			together with Lakshmana to the hermitage, and on his entering the hermitage 
			with those two, that sage shone forth like moon with a two starred constellation 
			called Punarvasu, the fifth or seventh lunar mansion, after dispersal 
			of mist. [1-29-25]

Shlok 26: On seeing the arrival of Vishvamitra all of the resident sages of Accomplished 
			Hermitage have quickly approached him with hustle and bustle adoring 
			him. [1-29-26]

Shlok 27: Those sages reverenced Vishvamitra according to their deservedness, 
			likewise they have offered hospitality to both of the princes, Rama 
			and Lakshmana. [1-29-27]

Shlok 28: Those two princes from Raghu's dynasty and the enemy-subjugators, namely 
			Rama and Lakshmana, briefly took rest and adjoining palms they spoke 
			to the sagely tiger Vishvamitra. [1-29-28]

Shlok 29: "Oh, the eminent sage, today itself you may undertake the ritual of 
			solemnity that is undertaken prior to the main ritual, be safe, and 
			let this Hermitage of Accomplishment become an accomplished one in eradiating 
			vice true to its name, and let the word of yours given to my father 
			in fetching me to this place come true." So said Rama to Vishvamitra, 
			supported by Lakshmana. [1-29-29]

Shlok 30: When he is said so, that great radiant and supreme sage Vishvamitra, 
			thereupon scrupulously undertook the vow of ritual controlling his senses. 
			[1-29-30]

[Commentary] Vishvamitra controlling senses etc., is to say that he will cut off 
			from external world occupying himself with the ritual, without getting 
			anger and the like during the progression of this ritual, as explained 
			at 1-19-7 to King Dasharatha.

Shlok 31: Both the youngsters Rama and Lakshmana on spending that night vigilantly 
			got up with the sunrise. On finishing morning time bathing they meditated 
			upon the easterly aurora, and then on completing the supreme meditation 
			on Gayatri in its regularity, they addressed themselves to sage Vishvamitra, 
			who by now has enkindled ritual fire and sitting before the Altar of 
			Fire. [1-29-31, 32]

[Commentary] Rama and Lakshmana spent that night vigilantly but not in a clam and collected way.

SARGA 30
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana while safeguarding the ritual of Sage Vishvamitra for six days 
and nights, on the last night demons named Maareecha and Subaahu come to hinder 
the ritual. Rama acts deftly and hits out Maareecha to a long distance, but kills 
the other, namely Subaahu. Rama thus makes the ritual of sage Vishvamitra a success.

Shlok 1: The two enemy subjugators, Rama and Lakshmana, who are sensible of their conduct 
according to time and place, and who will be sensibly talking according to time 
and place, those princes then spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-30-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, god, we are interested to listen at which time those night-walkers come to 
disturb the ritual, and at which time we have to safeguard the ritual from them, 
that you tell us, let not that moment pass away." [1-30-2]

[Commentary] It appears from the word order as above, 'at which time those two demons are to 
be safeguarded by us?' But positioning the word samrakShNiiyau is a grammarian's 
headache. On this many kinds of declinations are said. Rama Tilaka attributes this
rakShNiiyau 'to be safeguarded' to ritual, and he says that 'from whom the 
ritual is to be safeguarded'

Shlok 3: All the sages available there are delighted with the princes of Kakutstha dynasty 
who are speaking thus and making haste for a combat with demons and they praised 
them. [1-30-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, Raghava-s, you have to safeguard this ritual for six nights and days from today, 
and this Sage Vishvamitra who is under the vow of ritual goes into muteness as required 
by the vow." Thus said the other sages near at ritual place. [1-30-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing that sentence of the other sages those two glorious princes have wakefully 
safeguarded that woodland of the ritual for six nights and days. [1-30-5]

Shlok 6: On alertly patrolling nearby the Altar of Fire those two enemy-destroyers who are 
the wielders of great bows and valiant ones have protected the best sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-30-6]

Shlok 7: While that period of six days is elapsing and when the sixth day has come, then 
Rama said to Saumitri, "you be prepared and be on alert." [1-30-7]

Shlok 8: While Rama is saying thus himself quickening to combat then the fire in the Altar 
of Fire flared up suddenly and highly, brightening the chief officiator of the ritual, 
namely Vishvamitra, and other priests around it. [1-30-8]

[Commentary] The compound prajajwaala, with many stresses for the flare is given 
here to import that the ritual is achieving its climax and it will be fructified 
thereby. The demons enter just at this juncture to spoil the ritual.

Shlok 9: The Altar of Fire around which sacred grass, drink-vessels, oblation spoons, firewood-sticks, 
and heaps of flowers are kept, and around which Vishvamitra and the conductors of 
ritual are sitting, that altar flared high. [1-30-9]

[Commentary] The darbha is kusha grass used specifically in rituals even today.
chamasa is a wooden vessels used for consuming soma juice. srukk 
is an arm-length wooden spoon with a palm size receptacle at one end used to pour 
clarified butter and other liquids into Altar of Fire to the chanting of hymns.
samidha-s comprises items of wood pieces or sticks, mainly from sandalwood 
trees and a variety of other items that are offered into fire.

Shlok 10: While the Vedic ritual is proceeding well towards its conclusion according to hymnal 
rendering and rules of conducting the ritual, a strident and frightening blare is 
generated in the sky. [1-30-10]

Shlok 11: As to how massive clouds appear in torrential cloudburst, likewise two demons appeared 
enshrouding the sky, and performing wizardry they are about to swoop down towards 
the Altar of Fire. [1-30-11]

Shlok 12: Maareecha and Subaahu are the monstrous demons that have come along with their followers 
and they have started to pour down spates of blood. [1-30-12]

Shlok 13: On noticing the Altar of Fire swamped with streams of blood, then Rama swiftly ran 
towards that direction and saw the demons in the sky. [1-30-13]

Shlok 14: Perceiving that the two demons are about to swoop down on Altar of Fire in haste, 
that lotus-eyed Rama however gave a quick checking look at Lakshmana saying this 
sentence. [1-30-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: "Lakshmana, I am reluctant to eliminate this kind of these ill-behaved and raw flesh 
eating demons, but no doubt, they will be puffed out with Manava missile like a 
gust puffing thick clouds, you may see." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [1-30-15, 
16a]

Shlok 16b- 17: Saying so that agile Rama fitted the very benign and highly radiant arrow Maanava 
on his bow, and taking aim with it at Maareecha that highly furious Raghava darted 
it on the chest of Maareecha. [1-30-16b, 17]

Shlok 18: Cleanly hit with that great missile Maanava, demon Maareecha is pitched for a hundred 
yojana lengths in full, and flung down into an ocean rocking with tidewaters. [1-30-18]

Shlok 19: On seeing him highly whirling, rendered insensate and thrown out when rammed away 
with the strength of that Cold arrow Rama said this to Lakshmana. [1-30-19]

Shlok 20: "Lakshmana, see the Cold arrow belonging to Maanava missile expounded by Manu which 
is taking him away on baffling, but without taking away his life. [1-30-20]

[Commentary] Rama is reluctant to eliminate demon Maareecha at this juncture because the same 
demon discourages Ravana in confronting Rama, but becomes a golden deer at the behest 
of Ravana, at the time of Ravana's abducting Seetha. So, Rama shows forbearance 
at Maareecha till such time.

Shlok 21: "But I wish to kill these demons for they are ruthless, iniquitous, flagitious, 
ritual-hinderers and blood-drinkers." So said Rama to Lakshmana. [1-30-21]

Shlok 22: Thus saying to Lakshmana, as though to show his swift dexterity Rama, the descendent 
of Raghu dynasty, took up a very powerful missile called Aagneya astra, Fire-missile, 
and darted it on the chest of Subaahu, by which that demon Subaahu is struck and 
fell flat on ground. [1-30-22]

Shlok 23: In order to bring felicity to the sages that great glorious and supremely generous 
Raghava took up the missile of Air-god and hit down the remaining demons. [1-30-23]

Shlok 24: When Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, has eliminated all of the demons that 
are the hinderers of Vedic rituals, the sages available there in that hermitage 
idealised him as Indra was idealised once, when he became victories on demons. [1-30-24]

Shlok 25: On the completion of ritual beholding the precincts that are devoid of calamities 
the great sage Vishvamitra said this to Rama. [1-30-25]

Shlok 26: "My purpose in conducting the ritual is fully realised, oh, dextrous Rama, and you 
too, as a highly illustrious prince, have actualised the word of honour of your 
mentor, where one mentor is your father King Dasharatha and the other is myself, and 
likewise oh, valiant Rama the glory of this Accomplished hermitage is also actualised..." 
thus when Vishvamitra is applauding Rama, they have come close to vesper-time for 
vespertine prayers on Sandhya, the goddess of gloaming. [1-30-26]



SARGA 31
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishwamitra travels to Mithila kingdom to attend a ritual of King Janaka and 
also to see the auspicious bow of Shiva that is being worshipped in the palace of 
Janaka from ages. The other sages suggest to Rama, that he too may go over there 
along with them to see that marvellous bow. They all proceed from Siddha Ashram 
towards River SoNa, a tributary of Ganga, and camp on its bank for a night.

Shlok 1: Rejoicing for achieving the result of their journey with Vishvamitra, the brave 
Rama and Lakshmana then resided in that hermitage for that night, gladdening in 
their heart of hearts. [1-31-1]

Shlok 2: When that night turned into a new day, performing their morning chores both of the 
brother jointly approached Sage Vishvamitra, who is along with other sages by then. 
[1-31-2]

Shlok 3: And those gentle-speakers on reverencing that eminent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance 
is akin to the ritual-fire, they two spoke this highly courteous sentence to him. 
[1-31-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, tigerly-sage, here are your attendants sir, available in your attendance, what 
order is to be carried out further, oh, eminent saint, that you may order us. [1-31-4]

Shlok 5: When they have said that way all those great sages spoke to Rama, keeping Vishvamitra 
at the helm of affairs. [1-31-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh, best one among men, a highly righteous Vedic ritual belonging to King Janaka 
of Mithila is going to take place, and we the sages are going over there. [1-31-6]

Shlok 7: "Oh, tigerly-man Rama, if you can come along with us, it will be expedient for you 
to see a monumental gem of bow there. [1-31-7]

[Commentary] The sages are not insisting on Rama to come along, but advising him to have a glimpse 
of that marvellous bow of Shiva, which none can lift to string, so far. The topic 
of Seetha is also not brought out by them, either, because it is in the know of 
Vishvamitra alone, and not known to these sages. Kings and princes have their own 
protocol of proper invitation. Here a third party is inviting Rama to some other 
king's ritual, which Rama may reject for being a prince. But it is suggestive to 
say the maxim an aahuuto adhvaryam gacChet 'even uninvited can attend a 
Vedic-ritual...' Thus the sages are tempting, rather than inviting Rama to come 
to Mithila in the name of a divine bow, seeing which any valiant prince would easily 
get excited to string.

Shlok 8: "Oh, best one among men, in early times indeed gods gave that awesome bow which 
has an unimaginable power and which is superbly incandescent in wars to an erstwhile 
king of Mithila in a congregation of a Vedic-ritual. [1-31-8]

[Commentary] This is the bow of Shiva with which He destroyed the ritual of Daksha. Then gods 
pleased Shiva and obtained this bow from Him. Then gods gave it to Devaraata, an 
earlier king of Mithila as a boon of Vedic-ritual.

Shlok 19: "Gods cannot capably lift it to string; gandharva-s, no; asura-s, no; demons, no; 
and for human beings, not in any way. [1-31-9]

Shlok 10: "Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great 
mighty princes are rendered incapable to string its bowstring. [1-31-10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, tigerly-man Rama, there in Mithila you can see that particular bow of the great-souled 
king of Mithila and his highly admirable Vedic ritual too, if you come with us. 
[1-31-11]

Shlok 12: "Once Devaraata, the grandparent of the present king Janaka of Mithila, conducted 
a Vedic-ritual and he indeed prayed only for this supreme bow with a best grip-handle 
as the fruit of that ritual from all of the gods and oh, tigerly man Rama, he got 
the same from them. [1-31-12]

[Commentary] For this kuurma puraaNa, padma puraNna puts it as: 
priitaH ca bhagavaan iisaH trisuulii niila lohitaH | pradadau satru naasaartham 
janakaaya adbhutam dhanuH || kuurma puraaNa | | caapam shambhoH dayaat dattam - 
padma puraaNa 'Satisfying with the ritual of Devaraata of Janaka, the Trident 
holder and holder of venom in throat, namely god Shiva, gave the marvellous bow 
to eliminate enemies.'

Shlok 13: "That bow has got a regular worship and especially during the periods of
dhanur utsava-s, festivals of bows-and- arrows. Hence 
it is kept in the palace of King of Mithila, and oh, Raghava it is worshipped with 
a variety of sandalwood pastes, scents of aloe substance, and with incenses." [1-31-13]

Shlok 14: Saying so that best saint Vishvamitra started to travel on along with the assemblages 
of sages, and even along with Rama and Lakshmana, whose tacit consent to follow 
the sage is obtained by now, and on bidding farewell to the deities of woodlands 
of that Accomplished Hermitage, where his ritual is accomplished with the help of 
Rama and Lakshmana. [1-31-14]

Shlok 15: "Adieu, georgic deities, everything bodes well to you all, on accomplishment of 
the ritual I have undertaken here, I wish to go from this Accomplished Hermitage 
towards the ranges of Himalayan Mountains that are on the northern bank of River 
Ganga." [1-31-15]

Shlok 16: Thus saying farewell to woodland-deities that descendent of Kaushika, namely Vishvamitra, 
the saint whose wealth is his ascesis started to journey on aiming to reach the 
northern side of River Ganga. [1-31-16]

Shlok 17: While that best saint set forth, the team of his close followers who are the advocators 
of Vedic canons have moved behind him, approximately with a hundred carts loaded 
with their ritual paraphernalia. [1-31-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: Even the residents of that Hermitage of Accomplishment, namely animals and birds, 
closely followed that great-souled Vishvamitra, whose wealth is his ascesis, in 
herds and flocks. But that sage Vishvamitra made those flocks of birds and the herds 
of animals to return to their places, as they have shown enough courtesy. [1-31-18, 
19a]

[Commentary] This following of animals and birds is to suggest that while any guest proceeding 
from their place, it is the courtesy of the residents of that place or house, to 
see him off for a distance, unlike 'showing a person the door.' Here Vishvamitra 
is the guest at these woodlands.

Shlok 19b- 20a: Those assemblages of sages on going far on their path made a camp on the bank of 
River Sona when the sun is dangling towards west. [1-31-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: When the sun went into dusk those sages with illimitable resplendence took their 
bath and on kindling the consumer of kindled oblations they completed their evening 
fire ritual, and then squatted before sage Vishvamitra. [1-31-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: And even Rama along with Lakshmana on worshipping those sages squatted before that 
intellectual Vishvamitra. [1-31-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: With growing inquisitiveness that resplendent Rama has asked the tigerly sage Vishvamitra 
whose wealth is his ascesis. [1-31-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "Oh, godly sage, this place is glistening with well-developed woodlands, really 
what is this place? You be blest! It will be apt of you tell about it, in essence." 
Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra.[1-31-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b: Sage Vishvamitra whose vows are unselfish and whose ascesis is exalted is motivated 
with the words of Rama and staying amidst the sages he started to tell all about 
that place. [1-31-24b, c]



SARGA 32
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra starts to narrate Kusha's legend. Vishvamitra is the 
			offspring of Kusha's dynasty. Brahma gives boon to Kusha to beget four 
			sons and one among them is Kushanaabha. Kushanabha begets a hundred daughters 
			of excellent beauty. When Vayu, Air-god cherishes them all, those girls 
			refuse him, as they prefer an arranged marriage by their father. Then 
			Air-god in his indignation disfigures them all.

Shlok 1: "Once there was a highly righteous kingly sage who is the brainchild 
			of Brahma, whose ascesis is of higher order, who has never flouted the 
			rules of rituals or his vows, and who revered the knowers of virtue 
			by name Kusha." Thus Sage Vishvamitra commenced narration. [1-32-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "That great-souled Kusha begot four selfsame and mighty sons, namely 
			Kushamba, Kushanaabha, Adhuurtarajasa also called as Asuurtarajasa,  
			and Vasu through the princess of Vidarbha, which princess is of noble 
			birth and an eligible wife of Kusha. [1-32-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4: "With an aspiration that his sons shall uphold the principles of Kshatriya-s, 
			Kusha spoke to them who are brilliant, highly enthusiastic, virtue abiding, 
			and the advocators of truth saying, 'establish your rulership, sons, 
			and achieve righteousness abundantly.' [1-32-3b, 4]

Shlok 5: "On hearing the words of Kusha those four sons that are the formidable 
			ones in the world and the best men among people initiated to build four 
			cities. [1-32-5]

Shlok 6: "Great-resplendent Kushamba built the city named Kaushambii for his 
			part, and for his part the virtue-souled Kushanaabha built a city named 
			Mahodaya. [1-32-6]

Shlok 7: "Oh, Rama, noble-minded Adhuurtarajasa built a city named Dharmaaranya, 
			and king Vasu built a city in the name of Girivraja. [1-32-7]

[Commentary] It is believed that the city Kaushambii is the present day Kannauj and 
			Girivraja the present day Rajgir.

Shlok 8: "This land on which we are presently staying is known as the land of 
			virtue-souled Vasu, all around which these five best mountains are standing 
			high. [1-32-8]

Shlok 9: "This charming river that enters and exits Magadha province is well 
			known as the worthy River Maagadhi, and flowing amid the five of these 
			elevated mountains it shines forth like a garland enwreathing them. 
			[1-32-9]

[Commentary] This river is said to be the present day River Son



"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great mighty princes
							 are rendered incapable to string its bowstring.

Shlok 11: "This Maagadhi is that river which pertains to the developmental works 
			of the great-souled king Vasu and oh, Rama, flowing towards east to 
			its confluence in Ganga, this river garlands best farmlands and their 
			crops on its way. [1-32-10]

[Commentary] The confluence of this river with Ganga is said as the one now available 
			near at Patna, Bihar.

Shlok 11: "The virtue-souled kingly saint Kushanaabha gave birth to a hundred 
			daughters with unexcelled beauty through a celestial female called Ghritaachi. 
			[1-32-11]

[Commentary] Children begotten through celestial maidens are of superior nature for 
			further procreating a divine generation, like Shakuntala, who begot 
			Bharata, the earliest dynastic king.

Shlok 12: "Those girls when attained youthfulness they are lovely and on an occasion 
			they have gone to gardens and moved there about like one lightning with 
			a hundred streaks during rainy season, and while those girls that are 
			decorated with select ornaments are singing, dancing and playing musical 
			instruments, they got into a fantastic felicity. [1-32-12, 13]

Shlok 14: "On their coming to parklands those girls whose all limbs are pretty 
			and whose looks are unparalleled on earth, they looked like stars amid 
			clouds within the cloudy thickets of garden bushes. [1-32-14]

Shlok 15: "On seeing them who are flourishing with all their aspects together 
			with comeliness and ripeness, the all pervading Air-god, Vayu, spoke 
			this word to them. [1-32-15]

Shlok 16: " 'I have a desire for you all, hence leaving off the notions pertaining 
			to human beings you all become my wives, thereby you too will acquire 
			longevity like divinities. [1-32-16]

Shlok 17: " 'Teenage is always transitory, expressly in humans, but on marrying 
			me you will achieve undiminished youthfulness and forever you can be 
			youthful like immortal females.' Thus Air-god said to those girls. [1-32-17]

Shlok 18: "On hearing that proposal of Vayu, the Air-god whose strives are unimpeded, 
			then those hundred girls spoke this sentence laughing off his proposal. 
			[1-32-18]

Shlok 19: " 'we are aware that you inspirit all the living beings from inside, 
			oh, the ablest divinity, we are also aware of your uniqueness. But, 
			what for you are dishonouring all of us. [1-32-19]

Shlok 20: " 'We are the daughters of Kushanaabha, oh, best divinity, and we are 
			all capable of displacing you from your realm, but oh, god, we are restraining 
			ourselves in doing so only to conserve our ascetic values. [1-32-20]

Shlok 21: " 'That time shall never come, oh, god with sordid thinking, when we, 
			at our liberty, may look up for our grooms overlooking our veracious 
			father.' [1-32-21]

Shlok 22: " 'Our father is indeed our lord and for us he is the ultimate god too. 
			To whomever we are offered by our father in marriage he alone becomes 
			our husband.' So said hundred girls to Air-god. [1-32-22]

Shlok 23: On hearing their sentence of rejection, Vayu, the Air-god whose impact 
			is powerful, very angrily entered into all of the limbs of those girls 
			only to disfigure them. [1-32-23]

Shlok 24: "Those girls whom Air-god disfigured in that way have entered palace-chambers 
			of the king, but they have entered diffidently, embarrassedly, and tearfully. 
			[1-32-24]

Shlok 25: "That king on seeing his dear and attractive daughters as disfigured 
			and despondent girls he is highly perturbed and said this. [1-32-25]

Shlok 26: " 'Oh, daughters, what all is this? Who disregarded probity? Who disfigured 
			you all? Let it be said! Why you gesticulate saying nothing.' asking 
			thus that king sighed and quietened down waiting for a reply." Thus 
			Sage Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-32-26]



SARGA 33
------------------------------

[Text] Daughters of Kushanaabha report about the Air-god's mischief. Pleased 
			at their behaviour Kushanaabha thinks and arranges for their marriage 
			with Brahmadatta, a saintly king. After the marriage, by the touch of 
			hand of Brahmadatta the girls are rid of their misshapen bodies and 
			they again become great beauties.

Shlok 1: On hearing that sentence of scholarly Kushanaabha those hundred 
			girls touched his feet with their foreheads and spoke to him. [1-33-1]

Shlok 2: " 'The all-pervasive Air-god desired to dishonour us, oh, king, resorting 
			to improper approach and overlooking virtuous conduct. [1-33-2]

Shlok 3: " 'Our father is there and we are not independent, you be safe, hence 
			oh, Air-god, you may request our father to know whether he gives us 
			to you or not.' Thus we have told the Air-god, but... [1-33-3]

Shlok 4: " 'Though we all have spoken to him thus, that Air-god who is bound 
			by venality refused to take notice of our words and he has harmed us 
			a lot.' Thus those girls informed their father. [1-33-4]

[Commentary] Since then, because the Wind-God bent / The damsels' forms for punishment, 
			/ That royal town is known to fame / By Kanyakubja's borrowed name. 
			That is, the City of the Bent Virgins, the modern Kanauj or Canouge 
			- Griffith.

Shlok 5: On listening their words that highly virtuous and highly resplendent 
			king spoke to the hundred girls with unsurpassed virtue. [1-33-5]

Shlok 6: " 'Forgiving is the duty of imperturbable and you have done it. Excellent. 
			Oh, daughters, coursing through your unity my family's prestige is also 
			kept up. [1-33-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: " 'Forgiveness is an adornment to women, as a matter of fact, even for 
			men, and this matter called 'forgiving' that which is there, it is an 
			impracticable affair. That too, in respect of divinities. And the kind 
			of forgiveness you all possess uniformly, that is further laudable. 
			[1-33-7, 8a]

[Commentary] This also means: 'though you possess excellent aspects and persona alike 
			celestials, viz., apsara-s, for you are the children of celestial / 
			apsara Ghritachi... you have forgiven Air-god, without submitting yourselves 
			to bodily pleasures of humans.'

Shlok 8b- 9a: " 'Grace is altruism, grace is ritualism, oh, my daughters, grace is 
			glory, grace is virtue, and this universe is verily abiding in graciousness 
			alone for grace itself is the truth, isn't it!' Thus king Kushanaabha 
			said to his daughters and sent them away. [1-33-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: "On leaving those girls, oh, Rama, that king whose valour matches that 
			of gods and who is an expert in thinking strategies started to think 
			with his ministers on the topics like, as to how his daughters are to 
			be espoused to, to which country they are to be sent, at which time 
			marriage shall happen, and to which matching bridegroom the marriage 
			is to be proposed, and so on." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. 
			[1-33-9b, 10]

Shlok 11: During that time a great-resplendent sage named Cuulii is there, who 
			is propitious in his demeanour and who holds his semen upward, and who 
			has achieved high ascetic practise strictly according to Vedic canons. 
			[1-33-11]

[Commentary] The uurdhvaretas is that the yogi-s of a very high practice 
			of pure yoga called haThayoga, will hold their semen un-ejaculated 
			by use or misuse, and they make it course towards their heads through 
			the six-plexuses of human body. This type of practice is to enrich their 
			mental and physical glow and they will have a divine aura around them.

Shlok 12: "While that sage is in the practise of asceticism a celestial female served 
him at the place of his ascesis, safety be with you oh, Rama, she is Somada by her 
name, the daughter of Urmila. [1-33-12]

Shlok 13: "Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering 
			to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Cuulii 
			has become satisfied with her service. [1-33-13]

Shlok 14: "When her service is fructified, oh, Rama, that sage benevolently spoke 
			to her saying, 'I am perfectly pleased with your service, let good betide 
			you, what cherish of yours I have to fulfil.' [1-33-14]

Shlok 15: "Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada 
			who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke 
			with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. [1-33-15]

Shlok 16: " 'Vedic splendour is flourishing in you when you have become one with 
			Brahma, oh, supreme ascetic, I may please be endowed with a righteous 
			son whose ascetic spirituality may embody the spirituality enunciated 
			in Veda-s. [1-33-16]

Shlok 17: " 'I am unmarried and nobody's wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter 
			under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your 
			faculty of asceticism.' So said Somada to sage Cuulii. [1-33-17]

Shlok 18: "That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and 
			Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild. 
			[1-33-18]

[Commentary] The word 'cuuli' also read as Cuulina, another name for this sage 
			Cuuli.

Shlok 19: "King Brahmadatta endued with superb grandeur ruled from a city called 
			Kaampilya as with Indra ruling the heaven. [1-33-19]

Shlok 20: "The most righteous king Kushanaabha then made up his mind, oh, Rama 
			of Kakutstha, to espouse his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta. [1-33-20]

Shlok 21: "Inviting Brahmadatta that great-resplendent lord of the land, namely 
			the king Kushanaabha, married his hundred daughters to him, pleasing 
			highly in his heart of hearts. [1-33-21]

Shlok 22: "As with the tradition of marriage king Brahmadatta who vies with lord 
			of gods, namely Indra, in succession took the palm of each of the hundred 
			girls into his palm. [1-33-22]

Shlok 23: "By mere touch of hand of Brahmadatta alone, their misshape and desperation 
			are evanished, and all of those hundred maidens beamed bright as they 
			are retouched with utmost elegance. [1-33-23]

Shlok 23: "On seeing his daughters getting release from the effect of Air-god 
			Kushanaabha became highly joyful, and he took great delight time and 
			again as and when he looked at them. [1-33-24]

Shlok 25: "Later when the marriage is complete king Kushanaabha bade farewell 
			to king Brahmadatta along with his wives, his own hundred daughters, 
			and along with the groups of religious teachers. [1-33-25]

Shlok 26: "Somada, the celestial female and the mother of Brahmadatta, is gladdened 
			to see her son Brahmadatta, for the worthwhile deed done by him in removing 
			the blemish caused by the Air-god to the girls, or in bringing those 
			worthwhile girls as her daughter-in-laws. She is further gladdened while 
			her feet are traditionally and repeatedly touched by a hundred daughter-in-laws 
			in succession, coupled with her own raising of each of the daughter-in-law 
			to embrace for a hundred times. Thus Somada has gone on caressing each 
			of her hundred daughter-in-laws, and in doing so she is gladdened to 
			do so over and over again, she is gladdened. She thus praised Kushanaabha 
			for giving his gemlike daughters as her daughter-in-laws and blessed 
			the daughter-in-laws. [1-33-26]

[Text] Vishvamitra narrates about the birth of Gaadhi, his own father and the son of Kushanaabha. 
Incidentally he narrates about the emergence and prominence of River Kaushiki, who 
is Vishwamitra's elder sister turned out as a sacred River.

Shlok 1: When Brahmadatta has married and left, oh, Raghava, king Kushanaabha he embarked 
on Vedic-ritual called putrakaameSThi in order to 
beget a son because is sonless. [1-34-1]

Shlok 2: During the performance of the ritual, supremely generous Kusha, the brainchild of 
Brahma and the father of Kushanaabha, spoke to the king Kushanaabha. [1-34-2]

Shlok 3: " 'Oh, son, there will be a highly virtuous and selfsame son of yours, known as 
Gaadhi, and through him you also will get everlasting renown in the world.' " Thus 
Kusha said to Kushanaabha. [1-34-3]

Shlok 4: "Saying so, oh, Rama, Kushanaabha's father Kusha entered the sky and journeyed to 
the time-honoured abode of Brahma. [1-34-4]

Shlok 5: "Then after some time that highly intellectual Kushanaabha begot a supremely righteous 
son known by the name Gaadhi. [1-34-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, that eminently righteous Gaadhi is my father, and 
since I am born in Kusha dynasty, oh, Raghu's legatee, I got the name Kaushika." 
Sage Vishvamitra thus narrating to Rama. [1-34-6]

Shlok 7: "Even my elder sister who undertook benevolent vows and who is renowned by her name 
Satyavathi is there, oh, Raghava, and she is given in marriage to sage Ruchika. 
[1-34-7]

Shlok 8: "She journeyed to heaven with her body while she followed her departed husband and 
being a very generous lady she coursed as a great river renowned as River Kaushiki. 
[1-34-8]

[Commentary] Now called Kos'i (Cosy) corrupted from Kaus'ika, daughter of Kusha. 'This is one 
of those personifications of rivers so frequent in the Grecian mythology, but in 
the similar myths is seen the impress of the genius of each people, austere and 
profoundly religious in India, graceful and devoted to the worship of external beauty 
in Greece.' Gorresio.

Shlok 9: "Desiring to yield benefit for the welfare of world, my sister has emerged with 
her divinely pious and delightful waters, taking recourse to Himalayan Mountains. 
[1-34-9]

[Commentary] If the first compound is lokasya hitakaamaartham then 'to accord both 
mortal and immortal happiness; paaralaukika, aihikasaukhyam . My sister's 
holy waves are hurled / To purify and glad the world. - Griffith.

Shlok 10: "Thereby, oh, Rama, I am delightfully and abidingly residing on the mountainsides 
of Himalayas, in adjacency of my sister Kausiki in all my affection for her. [1-34-10]

Shlok 11: "She that Satyavathi for her part is a pious one, steadfast in truthfulness and 
righteousness, a husband devote, and such a highly fortunate one has emerged as 
a best river among rivers, namely River Kaushiki. [1-34-11]

Shlok 12: "Owing to my vow, oh, Rama, I left her for a while and came to the Accomplished 
Hermitage and owing to your magnificence I have become accomplished in that vow 
of mine. [1-34-12]

Shlok 13: "Oh, dextrous Rama, this is all about my dynasty, my province on which we are presently 
camping namely the riverbanks of Sona, and about my birth, and thus everything is 
narrated as you have asked me. [1-34-13]

Shlok 14: "By telling these legends it is past midnight, oh, Kakutstha, you get some sleep. 
Safe you be! Let no hindrance occur for us halfway on our pathway. [1-34-14]

Shlok 15: "Oh, Raghu's delight, trees are standstill... animals and birds have slouched... 
nightly sombre has pervaded all the confines. [1-34-15]

Shlok 16: "Eventide lapsed slowly and the vault of heaven filled with stars and starlets is 
splendorous as though orbs of heaven are overspread on its vault. [1-34-16]

Shlok 17: "Also, dissipating the darkness of the world with his brilliance, the moon with 
coolant moonbeams is rising up, gladdening the hearts of worldly beings. [1-34-17]

Shlok 18: "Now, the bands of yaksha-s, demons, even the ferocious ogres that feed on raw flesh, 
why them, all the beings that take pleasure in nights are astir, far and wide." 
So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-34-18]

Shlok 19: Saying so that greatly resplendent and eminent saint Vishvamitra paused, and then 
all the other sages have revered him saying, "well-said, well-said." [1-34-19]

Shlok 20: "Sublime is this lineage of Kusha dynasty which always dedicated itself to righteousness, 
and the dynasty of Kusha are the best ones among mankind, and they symbolise with 
god Brahma himself, thus they are highly reverential." Thus the other sages have 
applauded Vishvamitra and his dynasty. [1-34-20]

Shlok 21: "You alone are exemplarily selfsame to Brahma, oh, Vishvamitra of great-renown, 
and among rivers that prominent River Kaushiki is your sister, thus she is glorifying 
your ancestry." Thus the sages lauded Vishvamitra. [1-34-21]

Shlok 22: Sage Vishvamitra is pleased when those tigerly sages have laude him, and then that 
magnificent sage Vishvamitra lapsed into the lap of sleep, as the sun lapses into 
lap of dusk for that day. [1-34-22]

Shlok 23: Even Rama with a little astonishment coming upon him, applauding that tigerly-sage, 
and glided into the lap of sleep along with Soumitri. [1-34-23]



SARGA 35
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra along with others reach the banks of River Ganga and 
			they make their sojourn on that riverbank. There when Rama inquisitively 
			enquires about River Ganga Vishvamitra narrates the legend of Ganga, 
			as to how she is taken to heavens by gods from her father Himalayas.

Shlok 1: On sojourning the remaining night on the bank of river Sona along with 
			great-sages, Viswamitra spoke when that night is elapsing into a sunny 
			daybreak. [1-35-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, Rama, night fared into a sunny morning, eastern day-spring is set 
			in, hence awake and arise, you be safe, ready yourself for further travel." 
			[1-35-2]

Shlok 3: On hearing the words of Sage Vishvamitra, Rama woke up and on completion 
			of morning time religious activities he readied himself for further 
			journey and indeed spoke this sentence to the sage. [1-35-3]

Shlok 4: "This River Sona is with auspicious waters and even adorned with dunes, 
			where it is so deep. Oh, Brahman, in which of the two ways, namely 
			by fordless waters or by fordable water with dunes, we have to cross 
			this river?" [1-35-4]

Shlok 5: When Rama spoke to him thus sage Vishvamitra replied, "I propose the 
			same route by which these great sages are going. [1-35-5]

Shlok 6: Thus spoken by that astute Sage Vishvamitra, the other great sages travelled 
			on, indeed beholding diverse forests and their environs. [1-35-6]

Shlok 7: On going a distance on their way, and after a lapse of half a day, then 
			they perceived the prominent one among rivers and the one adored by 
			sages, namely River Ganga. [1-35-7]

Shlok 8: On seeing River Ganga with her pious waters and adored by swans and 
			saarasa waterfowls, all the sages felt delighted together with both 
			of the Raghava-s, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [1-35-8]

Shlok 9- 10- 11a: Then they sojourned on the riverbank of Ganga, and next on taking bath 
			in Ganga they have customarily offered that river's water as oblations 
			to their manes. After that, on enkindling the ritual-fire they have 
			also offered fire-oblations into it for gods. Later, dining on their 
			part of those ambrosian oblations with which they have oblated the fire, 
			those sages perched on the propitious banks of Ganga, surrounding the 
			great-souled Vishvamitra from all sides, to the contentment of their 
			heart in having performed religious chores on the riverbank of Ganga. 
			[1-35-9, 10, 11a]

Shlok 11b: When sages are sitting at ease then even Rama and Lakshmana sat down 
			according to their admissibility and custom of sitting before their 
			teachers, and then Rama highly gladdened at heart has spoken to Vishvamitra. 
			[1-35-11]

Shlok 12: "Oh, godly sage, I wish to listen about Ganga, the river that has a 
			trinal course, and as to how she is reaching the husband of rivulets 
			and rivers, namely the ocean, on pervading all the three worlds." Thus 
			Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-35-12]

Shlok 13: Motivated by Rama's words the eminent-sage Vishvamitra commenced to 
			narrate about the emergence and that way even about the progression 
			of River Ganga. [1-35-13]

Shlok 14: "The lordly mountain Himavan who is the greatest treasure trove of minerals, 
			Rama, also treasures up a pair of daughters who by their comeliness 
			are unequalled on earth. [1-35-14]

Shlok 15: "The slender-waisted and fascinating daughter of Mt. Meru, oh, Rama, 
			renowned by her name Mena, is the dear wife of Himavan and the mother 
			of those two daughters, indeed. [1-35-15]

Shlok 16: "This Ganga has emerged as an elder daughter to Himavan through Mena, 
			oh, Raghava, and that way a girl renowned by the name Uma has become 
			a second daughter to him. [1-35-16]

Shlok 17: "Later, all of the divinities intending to fulfil a divine purpose have 
			sought the lordly mountain Himavan to spare Ganga, who is scheduled 
			to become a tri-way-cruising river. [1-35-17]

Shlok 18: "With a righteous thinking and hopeful of the welfare in triadic world, 
			Himavan then spared his daughter Ganga whose flow is at her own volition. 
			[1-35-18]

Shlok 19: "Those divinities who are the well-wishers of the well-being of tri-world 
			welcomed Ganga, who is incidentally intended for the purpose of the 
			tri-world, and they came back to heaven fetching Ganga with them, with 
			a heartfelt joy for their purpose is fulfilled. [1-35-19]

Shlok 20: "The other daughter of Himavanta, oh, Raghu's descendent, that unmarried 
			girl namely Uma, she performed a rigorous sacrament taking hold of a 
			supreme devoutness as her ascesis itself is her wealth. [1-35-20]

Shlok 21: "As for Uma who is unified with her rigorous sacrament and who is adored 
			by all the world, that best one among mountains Himavanta gave such 
			a daughter to the unique god Rudra. [1-35-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, Raghava, the prominent one among rivers namely Ganga and Uma Devi 
			as well, these are the two daughters of the king of mountains that are 
			highly revered by the world. [1-35-22]

Shlok 23: "Dear boy Rama with beautiful gait, as to how the triply coursing Ganga 
			has cruised to heaven in the first phase, I have related all about that 
			cruise to you. [1-35-23]

[Commentary] The three-way coursing of the river is firstly as Ganga in the lap of 
			Himalayas. Then when she cruised heavenward with divinities as Deva 
			Ganga, or Mandaakini or Sudiirghika, it is second. Later, when she came 
			to earth from heaven and gone into ocean and even to netherworlds as 
			Jahnavi, it is the third. There are variations for this. Some say that 
			the river's entry into sky is the first, by taking words gatimataam 
			vara, gati and deriving meaning as - which sky grants a path for 
			all moving things etc., and the next is her entry to heaven, and nextly 
			her coming to earth. And some say that gods have not left her in middle 
			of the sky to come to heaven at a later time, and hence her three courses 
			are as Ganga, Mandaakini, and Jahnavi.

Shlok 24: "As such, that marvellous and sinless daughter of the lordly mountain 
			Himavanta, ever-flowing in the form of water, ascended to the abode 
			of divinities and became devaganga , Divine 
			River. [1-35-24]



SARGA 36
------------------------------

[Text] Shiva on his marriage with Uma is in the conjugal bliss for a long period 
			due to his yogic powers. Fearing the result of that prolonged activity 
			all gods pray for the cessation of it because none in any world can 
			carry that offspring. Shiva accepting that request asks them where to 
			discharge the sperm that has already stirred up. Gods indicate the earth 
			as the taker. Shiva accordingly inundates the earth with his fluid. 
			Then the Fire-god is dispatched to consolidate that into a reed forest 
			called sharavaNa . Goddess Uma ireful at 
			the prevention of begetting a son, now curses gods and earth to be childless.

Shlok 1: When that sage Vishvamitra has finished narration of the legend of the 
			daughters of Himavanta, both the brave ones, namely Raghava and Lakshmana 
			in their turn have extolled that legend and spoke to that eminent-sage. 
			[1-36-1]

Shlok 2: "This admirable discourse given by you about Ganga is exhaustive in 
			righteousness, oh, Brahman, and it will be apt of you to tell emphatically 
			about the divine and earthly legend of the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			namely Ganga, for you are aware to expatiate upon it. [1-36-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: "By which reason that world purifier Ganga influxes into three paths? 
			Oh, virtue-knower, and connected with which deeds of merit this triple-courser 
			Ganga is renowned as the best one among all the rivers in three worlds?" 
			Thus Rama and Lakshmana have asked the sage Vishvamitra. [1-36-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: When Kakutstha-s have enquired that way, the ascetically-wealthy sage 
			Vishvamitra has narrated all the legend of Ganga in its entirety, staying 
			among the sages. [1-36-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: "On his getting married to Uma, oh, Rama, the sublime-ascetic and bluish 
			throated god Shiva, as his throat became blue when he consumed poison 
			during the churning of Milky Ocean, at one time with a predilection 
			towards her he has started lovemaking with her. [1-36-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b: "While that sublime, sagacious and blue-throated God Shiva is in lovemaking, 
			oh, enemy-scorcher Rama, a hundred divine years have elapsed, even then 
			he had no son in her, namely Goddess Uma. [1-36-6b, c, 7]

[Commentary] The hundred divine years are said to be 36,000 mortal years and this 
			goes with the calculation of yuga Indian 'era' calculation 
			where two thousand of four yuga-s, kR^ita, treta, dvaapara, kali 
			yuga-s are one brahmadina Brahma's day etc.

Shlok 7b- 8a: "All the gods headed by Brahma have then started to ponder, 'is there 
			anybody who can inevitably sustain that being which emerges from this 
			goddess Uma after this prolonged yogic act of copulation with Shiva?' 
			This being the worry of all gods they have prepared for action. [1-36-7b, 
			8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: "All of the gods on approaching and paying their deference to Shiva 
			spoke this to him, 'oh, God of Gods, oh, one who is interested in the 
			welfare of these worlds, oh, Great-God, considering the supplication 
			of all gods it will be apt of you to bestow grace.' [1-36-8b, 9]

[Commentary] This prolonged act of copulation is an act of yoga called mahaa- 
			maithuna. The Shaktaite Tantriks who practise panca-ma-kaara 
			: madya, maamsa, matsya, mudra, maithuna 'liquor' 'mutton' 'fish' 
			'postures' [loosely: callisthenics] and 'copulation' make use of these 
			things. In these practises, the yogis use mudra-s 'posture' 
			'callisthenics' at the time of copulation even, so that there will be 
			no ejaculation for a longer period. This is their 'Five-element theory...'

Shlok 10- 11: " 'Worlds cannot capably bear your offspring born out of your effulgence, 
			oh, Supreme-God, hence you may practice yogic asceticism along with 
			your consort Goddess Uma in unison with Vedic postulates of Yoga, rather 
			than progeniture, and desiring the welfare of the three worlds you may 
			please retain your refulgent seed within your own radiance, thus protect 
			this universe, since it will not be apt of you to render it devoid of 
			worlds with the efflux of the unmanageable potence of yours .' So said 
			gods to Shiva. [1-36-10, 11]

[Commentary] The word tejas also means semen, or offspring, besides resplendence
			tejaH paraakrame praaNe varcas arciShi retasi - ratnamaala 
			thus the prospective offspring through ejaculation is the problem here, 
			because Kumara, or, Skanda takes birth with all the irrepressible effulgence 
			of Shiva, plus his own.

Shlok 12: "On listening the words of gods that Rarefied-God of Universe, namely 
			Shiva said, 'so be it,' and further spoke this to all of the gods, indeed. 
			[1-36-12]

Shlok 13: " 'I wish to bear my sperm in my virility and Uma in hers, let the immortals 
			and mortals as well, derive a perfect bliss. [1-36-13]

Shlok 14: " 'But that part which has already stirred up from its place is irrestrainable, 
			as such, oh gods of eminence, you tell me who can contain that part 
			of the unexcelled potence.' So said Shiva to gods. [1-36-14]

Shlok 15: "Thus spoken by Shiva, then the gods in reply spoke to him whose banner 
			is Divine-Bull, namely Shiva, 'that part of the potence which has already 
			stirred up, the earth indeed endures that now. [1-3-15]

Shlok 16: "Thus said by the gods that Yogi of par excellence and the God of Gods, 
			Shiva, discharged his refulgent semen with which the earth together 
			with its mountains and forests is overspread. [1-36-16]

Shlok 17: "Thereby the gods in their turn said even to Fire-god, 'you enter the 
			great-potence of Rudra along with Wind-god, lest that potence may annihilate 
			the earth and earthlings, because you can consume anything that comes 
			in touch with you. [1-36-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: "And when Fire-god invaded that great-potence of Shiva it has emerged 
			as White-mountain, also thus it has become as a divine forest of reeds 
			equalling the Sun and Fire in its resplendence, wherefrom the highly 
			brilliant Kumara has emerged. [1-36-18, 19a]

[Commentary] Because Kumara, or Skanda took birth through Fire-god from the great-potence 
			of Shiva, he is called the one born out of fire. Because Krittika stars 
			have suckled him he is also called as Kaaritkeya. The birth and legend 
			of Kaartikeya is detailed in the next chapter relating to Ganga.

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Later on, the gods together with the assemblages of sages are well 
			pleased at heart as it has happened according to their prayer, thereby 
			they fulsomely adored Shiva and even Uma. [1-36-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "Oh, Rama, but the daughter of Himalayan Mountain, namely Uma, while 
			irefully saying this to the divinities she cursed them all with her 
			eyes reddened in anger. [1-36-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: " 'Wherefore, I who am desirous of a son had been prevented from the 
			intimacy with my husband, therefore you shall be infecund to beget progeny 
			through your own wives. [1-36-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22- 23a: " 'And from now onwards you wives shall remain infertile...' and on 
			saying this way to all of the gods she also gave a curse to the earth. 
			[1-36-22, 23a]

[Commentary] Thus the celestials do not directly breed. They take the agency of humans 
			or other mortals to bring forth their offspring as in the case of the 
			monkey race, and Menaka, and as in the case of Vishvamitra giving birth 
			to Shakuntala, who in her turn gave birth to Bharata, so on.

Shlok 23b- 24: " 'Oh, Earth, your appearance shall be bizarre and you will be a wife 
			to many. And oh, verily base-minded earth, rendered sully by my anger 
			you shall have no gratification caused by the children as you are bigoted 
			against my son. [1-36-23b, 24]

[Commentary] The sin of earth to bear the curse of Uma Devi is to accept the semen 
			of Shiva on her surface. The appearance of earth will not be in one 
			kind or quality for it has lands and oceans, deserts and forests, volcanoes 
			and mountains, ice and humidity, etc. Further, the earth is the official 
			wife to numerous kings. The earth is also cursed to not to have the 
			delight of her children. The earth has Naraka, the demon, and Seetha 
			as her children. But these two are not begotten through any seminal 
			contact by earth, and further, for earth it is as good as not having 
			these two as her children, for such is the plight of these two so-called 
			children of earth on earth. After many tumults in her life, even Seetha 
			asks her mother on earth, i.e., mother earth herself, to take her back 
			into her womb.

Shlok 25: "That God of Gods Shiva becoming ill at ease to look at all of the distressed 
			gods, equally feeling small to convince his consort Uma, he has started 
			to journey towards the western quarter which is ruled by Rain-god. [1-36-25]

Shlok 26: "On going to the northern side of Himalayan Mountains, that God of Gods, 
			Shiva settled down in ascesis along with his consort Uma on the peak 
			of a mountain emerged from Himalayas. [1-36-26]

[Commentary] Here some say the mountain on which Shiva settled for ascesis as 
			himavatprabhava giving it a full name, like Mt. Kailash or Kanchanjunga 
			etc. If any such mountain peak is named and available in mythologies 
			or in Himalayas, this needs a revision.

Shlok 27: "This is the legend of mountain's daughter, namely Goddess Uma vividly 
			narrated to you, oh, Rama, and now listen from me along with Lakshmana 
			about the emergence of Ganga. [1-36-27]



SARGA 37
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra continues his narration about the earthly course of Ganga, her 
			begetting Kaartikeya, Krittika-stars breast-feeding that boy, gods naming that 
			boy as Kaarthikeya, and that boy's anointment as the Chief of Celestial Armies.

Shlok 1: "While god Shiva is undertaking ascesis thus, then the gods desiring an Army Chief 
			for celestial forces have arrived in the audience of Forefather Brahma, along 
			with Indra and keeping Fire-god at their fore." Sage Vishvamitra continued his 
			narration to Rama. [1-37-1]

Shlok 2: "On approaching the Forefather Brahma, oh, Rama, all of the celestials headed 
			by Fire-god and along with Indra have venerated and then spoke this to him. [1-37-2]

Shlok 3: " 'Oh, god Brahma, he who has hypothetically given a Chief of Celestial Army in 
			the form of his potence that god Shiva is undertaking a supreme ascesis, indeed 
			along with Goddess Uma. [1-37-3]

[Commentary] The potence that is stirred from Shiva and given to earth as in last chapter has 
			not yet materialised as Kaarthikeya.

Shlok 4: " 'Looking forward for the welfare of the worlds, oh, knower of the procedures, 
			Brahma, you may order us clearly what is to be done next, as you alone are our 
			ultimate recourse. [1-37-4]

Shlok 5: "On listening the words of gods, Brahma, the Forefather of all the worlds, soothingly 
			spoke this to the celestials with sweet words. [1-37-5]

Shlok 6: " 'What the Daughter of Mountain, namely Goddess Uma, has said that 'you shall 
			have no posterity in your own wives' is true and it cannot be decried, and it 
			is unambiguous too. [1-37-6]

Shlok 7: " 'In whom the Fire-god can procreate an enemy-destroying Chief of Celestial Armies, 
			such an empyreal Ganga is there. [1-37-7]

Shlok 8: " 'The elder daughter King of Mountains, namely Ganga, will graciously welcome 
			the offspring from Fire-god, and that act of Ganga in welcoming the offspring 
			through Fire-god will also be pleasurable in many ways to the younger daughter 
			of King of Mountains, namely Uma, no doubt about it.' So said Brahma to all the 
			gods. [1-37-8]

Shlok 9: "On hearing those words of Brahma, oh, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, all 
			the gods have praisefully worshipped him, as their ends are achieved at the bidding 
			fair of Brahma. [1-37-9]

Shlok 10: "On going to that supreme Mt. Kailash, oh, Rama, which is heaped up with many 
			ores, all of those gods have assigned the Fire-god to father a son. [1-37-10]

Shlok 11: " 'Oh, Fire-god, you please coordinate the mission of gods, oh, great-resplendent 
			god of Fire, you may release the potence of Shiva, which you have contained so 
			far, in the daughter of King of Mountains, namely River Ganga.' Thus, all gods 
			have requested the Fire-god. [1-37-11]

Shlok 12: "On assuring the gods that he will do his best, the Fire-god approached Ganga 
			entreating, 'Oh, Goddess Ganga, you verily bear pregnancy with the potence of 
			Shiva, since this is the select process of all the gods.' So said Fire-god to 
			River Ganga. [1-37-12]

Shlok 13: "On listening that sentence of Fire-god, River Ganga adopted a celestial form 
			readying herself, and on seeing her glorious mien the Fire-god seeped throughout 
			her. [1-37-13]

Shlok 14: "The Fire-god then drenched River Ganga from all over with the potence of Shiva 
			which he contained so far, oh, Raghu's delight Rama, and every rill and channel 
			of Ganga is replete with it. [1-37-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: "River Ganga then spoke this to the Fire-god who is in the lead of all gods, 'oh, 
			god, I am incapable to bear up the rampant fervour of yours, and while being burnt 
			with the fire of god Shiva compounded with that of yours my life-force is very 
			highly tortured.' [1-37-15, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "He who consumes fire-oblations on behalf of all the gods, that Fire-god seeing 
			the miserable condition of River Ganga then spoke this to her, ''you may lay away 
			that embryo here at the side of Himalayan Mountains.' So said Fire-god to River 
			Ganga. [1-37-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Oh, great-resplendent Rama, on hearing the words of Fire-god, oh, charming prince 
			Rama, River Ganga indeed ejected that great-radiant embryo of Shiva from all her 
			rills and channels. [1-37-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "Which refulgent embryo with the glitter of molten gold has emerged from River 
			Ganga is there that has reached earth, and from that the silver, and even the 
			gold with its matchless dazzle have emerged. [1-37-18]

Shlok 19b- 20: "In that process, copper and iron are also generated from that combustion of fires 
			of Shiva and Fire-god, and the residua have become tin and lead, and thus that 
			embryo on reaching the earth has evolved itself into various other elements also. 
			[1-37-19b, 20]

Shlok 21: "But, just when that embryo is laid down on Himalayan mountains, entire reed-garden 
			sprouted on that mountain is made brilliant by that glittering embryo and the 
			reed-garden itself has become golden. [1-37-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, tigerly-man, from then onwards the gold with its brilliance equalling that 
			of the Fire-god is renowned by the name of jaataruupa 
			, one that retains its birth-time form, and oh, Raghava, everything on the mountain, 
			say grass, trees, climbers, and shrubs, all have become golden. [1-37-22]

[Commentary] The gold has the etymological name of jaataruupa 'birth-time-form.' 
			As and when Ganga's disgorged her womb there appeared a forest of fire like gold. 
			So, the gold glowing like fire is called gold at many places in Ramayana. Pt. 
			Satya Vrat.

Shlok 23: "Then for the boy who took birth from the embryo deposited in Himalayas, the Wind-gods 
			along with Indra have arranged Krittika stars to simultaneously suckle him. [1-37-23]

Shlok 24: "Those Krittika stars have decided among themselves that 'this boy shall be the 
			son for all of us,' and on making such a best resolve they suckled the just born 
			boy. [1-37-24]

Shlok 25: "All the gods have then said, 'this boy will be renowned in all the three world 
			as Kaarthikeya, as Krittika-stars have suckled him, with any doubt.' [1-37-25]

Shlok 26: "On hearing that blessing of gods Krittika stars gave a wash to that excellently 
auspicious boy who is radiant like fire, and who slid down from the secretion of 
the womb of Ganga. [1-37-26]

Shlok 27: "And gods called that boy, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, whose glow is like that of flaring 
			fire and who is ambidextrous as 'Skanda' for he slid down from the secretions 
			of a womb. [1-37-27]

Shlok 28: "Then an unexcelled milk instantly came forth from the breasts of the six Krittika-stars, 
			and becoming a six-faced one that boy too sucked that milk from the six Krittika-stars 
			at the same time. [1-37-28]

[Commentary] It is said that each of the six Krittika-stars came forward to give her milk firstly 
			to this boy. Observing their eagerness to feed him, Skanda / Kaartikeya made his 
			one face into six and sucked all the milk of all the six stars and become an adolescent 
			boy in day. Hence he looked like the one with six faces, by which he is called
			ShaNmukha, six-faced deity. Later he argues with his father Shiva that 
			he is superior to Shiva, because he has five-faces of Shiva, plus his own, totalling 
			to a six, and he is a six-faced deity, superior to the five-faced god, namely 
			Shiva. In another way, the boy by birth is dextrous and he sucked the milk of 
			all the six mothers in split second with one face, but it appeared to all deities 
			that the boy has been sucking milk with six faces, i.e., with rapid-face-movement. 
			Thus on establishing his ambidextrous personality, the gods nominate him as the 
			Chief of Celestial Army.

Shlok 29: "On sipping the milk just for one day he became an adolescent boy on that day 
			itself, and even though he is of delicate constitution as a boy, that taskmaster 
			triumphed over the army troops of demons by his own vigour. [1-37-29]

Shlok 30: "All of the celestial have then come together under the leadership of Fire-god 
			and they anointed that highly resplendent boy, Skanda, or Kaarthikeya, as the 
			Chief of Celestial Army troops. [1-37-30]

Shlok 31: "This way, I have vividly narrated the legend of Ganga to you, oh, Rama, like 
			that the Divine and Meritorious legend of the emergence of Kumara, namely Skanda 
			is also narrated. [1-37-31]

Shlok 32: "He who is a devotee of Kartikeyaa, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, he thrives with longevity, 
			also with sons, grandsons on this humanly earth in his mortal life, and on its 
			conclusion he becomes one with Skanda on journeying to Skanda's abode. [1-37-32]



SARGA 38
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra narrates the legend of Sagara, the earliest King of 
			Ayodhya and Rama's forefather, who is childless, but who begets 
			sixty thousand sons of merit and one son of demerit. Emperor Sagara 
			is the one who brought celestial Ganga onto the surface of earth..

Shlok 1: Describing that legend of Kaartikeya to Rama, the descendent of Kaushi, 
			namely sage Vishvamitra has further spoken this best sentence worded 
			melodiously to Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha. [1-38-1]

Shlok 2: "Once there was a valiant and virtue-souled king of Ayodhya named Sagara, 
			who is without offspring, as such he was longing for offspring. [1-38-2]

Shlok 3: "The daughter of King of Vidarbha, renowned by name Keshini, is the 
			eldest wife of Sagara, and she was virtue-minded, and an advocate of 
			truth. [1-38-3]

Shlok 4: "The daughter of Arishtanemi, namely sage Kashyapa, and who is also 
			the sister of Garuda, the Divine-Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, is the second 
			wife of Sagara, who is known by the name Sumati. [1-38-4]

Shlok 5: "Reaching the Himalayan Mountains along with his two wives that 
			great King Sagara practised asceticism on a mountain called Brugu-prsravana 
			for progeny. [1-38-5]

[Commentary] The Mt. Brugu-prsravana is said to be among Himalayan range on which 
			the kindness of Sage Bhrigu is ever- flowing.

Shlok 6: "On completion of a hundred years of ascesis, and when the Sage Bhrugu 
			is worshipped with asceticism, that sage who is a prominent one among 
			the patrons of truth bestowed a boon to Sagara. [1-38-6]

Shlok 7: " 'Oh, merited one, you will achieve very admirable progeny, and 
			oh, best one among men, you will also acquire an unparalleled renown 
			in the world. [1-38-7]

Shlok 8: " 'One of your wives will mother a son who enriches your dynasty, oh, 
			dear sire, and the other mothers sixty thousand sons.' Said Sage Bhrigu 
			to Sagara. [1-38-8]

Shlok 9: Highly gladdened are the daughters of kings of Vidarbha and Aristanemi, 
			i.e., the queens of Sagara, and on making palm-fold in supplication 
			at the sage who is speaking that way, and on gaining the grace of that 
			sage they spoke to him. [1-38-9]

Shlok 10: " 'Which of us will carry one son, oh, Brahma-sage, and which of us 
			begets numerous sons, we two wish to listen about that, oh, Brahman, 
			let your word betide truth.' Thus, the queens of Sagara spoke to the 
			sage. [1-38-10]

Shlok 11: On listening their words the Sage Bhrigu spoke in a glorious tone, 'let 
			your freewill be brought to bear this issue'. [1-38-11]

Shlok 12: 'Whether one wants one son who enriches dynasty, or whether numerous 
			sons who will be highly energetic, highly renowned, and highly enthusiastic. 
			Who wants which boon from either of them?' Thus, the Sage gave them 
			the option. [1-38-12]

Shlok 13: "On listening the words of the sage, oh, Rama, oh, delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty, the first queen Keshini has chosen one son who enriches the 
			dynasty in the presence of King Sagara. [1-38-13]]

Shlok 14: "Sumati, the sister of mighty-winged Garuda and the second queen of 
			Sagara has then chosen sixty thousand sons with great enthusiasm and 
			high reputation. [1-38-14]

Shlok 15: "On performing circumambulations to the Sage Bhrigu along with wives, 
			oh, Raghu's scion, also on reverencing him head-bent, the king Sagara 
			proceeded to his own city. [1-38-15]

Shlok 16: When the time rolled by then the elder wife Keshini gave birth to the 
			son of Sagara who is reputed by the name Asamanja. [1-38-16]

Shlok 17: But the second queen Sumati on part, oh, tigerly-man Rama, verily 
			delivered a round and long egg which is like a single gourd, and on 
			breaking it up sixty thousand sons are issued forth from that cucumber 
			like egg. [1-38-17]

Shlok 18: The childminders brought up those siblings in vessels filled with ghee, 
			the clarified butter, and after a protracted time all of the children 
			have attained youthfulness. [1-38-18]

Shlok 19: After a long time the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara have become 
			youthful, and handsome in their aspects. [1-38-19]

Shlok 20- 21a: But, oh, best one among men, oh, Rama, the elder son of the king Sagara, 
			namely Asamanja, always used to grab and hurl children into the waters 
			of River Sarayu, and on seeing the drowning children he used to enjoy 
			with laughter. [1-38-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: This way, when that son Asamanja is with sinister activity, a torturer 
			of goodmen, and delighter in the undesirable activities towards citizens, 
			his father king Sagara expatriated him from the city. [1-38-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] This Asamanja appears to be the person from the first-generation of 
			sadistic child abusers, prior to Kamsa of Bhagavata.

Shlok 22b- 23a: But Asamanja's son is a valorous one, who by name is Anshuman, and who 
			is an acceptable one for all people and who fondly converses with all. 
			[1-38 -22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "Oh, best one among men, Rama, then after along time a decided thought 
			has occurred to king Sagara that, 'I shall perform a Vedic-ritual.'[1-38-23b, 
			24a]

Shlok 24b: That king Sagara who is an expert in Vedic-procedures has then taken 
			a decision along with the assemblages of his religious-teachers insofar 
			as the procedures of the ritual are concerned, and he commenced to perform 
			the Vedic-ritual. [1-38-24b, c]



SARGA 39
------------------------------

[Text] The ritual horse released by Emperor Sagara is snatched away by Indra 
			in order to cause hindrance to the ritual. The ritual cannot proceed 
			to culmination without the horse. Then Sagara orders his sixty thousand 
			sons to search for that horse, asking them to dig earth to trace it, 
			if it is not found on earth. And the princes will dig earth when they 
			have not found the horse on earth, to the grief of beings living in 
			netherworlds.

Shlok 1: On listening the narration of Vishvamitra, Rama, the delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty is highly rejoiced, and at the end of the episode he spoke to 
			sage whose glow is fire like. [1-39-1]

Shlok 2: I am interested to listen this episode exhaustively, oh, Brahman, let 
			good betide you, how my ancestor Sagara had completed the Vedic-ritual, 
			really. [1-39-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: On listening the words of Rama that are inclusive of his inquisitiveness, 
			Sage Vishvamitra smilingly spoke to that descendent of Kakutstha, "oh, 
			Rama, let the episode of the great-souled Sagara be listened vividly." 
			Vishvamitra thus commenced to narrate that episode. [1-39-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: The father-in-law of god Shankara who is well-known by the name of 
			Himavan sets eyes on Mt. Vindhya, which stands as loftily as Himalayas, 
			and those two mountains peer at each other. [1-39-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: Oh, best one among men, Rama, that Vedic-ritual of Sagara started 
			in between those two mountains, namely Himalayas and Vindhya ranges, 
			and oh, tigerly-man Rama, that area is renowned for Vedic-rituals, isn't 
			it! [1-39-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Oh, dear sire Rama, the grandson of Sagara and the son of exiled Asamanja 
			is Amshuman, oh, descendant of Kakutstha, which Anshuman's bow will 
			be unfaltering and who is a top-speeded chariot-rider, and he has escorted 
			ritual-horse released. [1-39-6b, 7a]

[Commentary] Details regarding the release of horse are at Bala Kanda 1-14-1

Shlok 7b- 8a: And on the day of a sacred function called ukthyam 
			, Indra assumed the form of a demon and stole the ritual horse of the 
			chief of the ritual, namely Sagara. [1-39-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: While that ritual-horse of the great-souled Sagara is stolen, all the 
			congregations of the Ritviks, the religious-teachers, then spoke to 
			the chief propitiator, namely Sagara. [1-39-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: 'Oh, Sagara,the descendent of Kakutstha, at this auspicious time the 
			ritual horse is hastily diverted, you kill him who stole the horse, 
			and let that horse be fetched'. [1-39-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: 'This hindrance in Vedic-ritual will become inauspicious for all of 
			us, thereby, oh, king, action may be taken as to how there can be no 
			fault in proceedings of the ritual.' The religious-teachers of Sagara 
			have advised him in this way. [1-39-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On hearing the words of religious-teachers that king Sagara indeed 
			spoke this much to his sixty thousand sons in that religious-council. 
			[1-39-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: 'Oh, sons, I do not envisage any way in for demons into this ritual, 
			since oh, best ones among men, holy-sanctifiers who themselves are sanctified 
			by the Vedic-hymns are conducting this glorious Vedic-ritual, isn't 
			it. [1-39-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: 'Oh, sons, you may therefore proceed to search for the horse and its 
			thief on entire earth as far as it is garlanded by the ocean, and safety 
			betides you all. [1-39-13]

Shlok 14b- 15: 'Oh, sons, let each prince advance searching one square yojana of 
			earth, by my order you dig up the earth until the appearance of the 
			horse, while searching for the stealer of that horse. [1-39-14b, 15]

Shlok 16: 'As for myself, I will stay here only along with my grandson, namely 
			Amshuman, and with the congregation of religious-teachers till the horse 
			appears, as I am under vow of the ritual.' Thus Sagara instructed to 
			his sixty thousand sons and stayed back at the ritual place. [1-39-16]

Shlok 17: Animated by their father's words those great-mighty princes enthusiastically 
			proceeded onto earth's surface in the preliminary round of search. [1-39-1]

Shlok 18: But, oh, tigerly-man Rama, on going round the earth in its entirety 
			those great-mighty princes did not find that horse, then as said by 
			their father they mapped the earth to a unit of one square yojana for 
			each of them, and each of them hollowed out each and every area on the 
			surface of earth with their arms that have the touch of the diamonds. 
			[1-39-18]

Shlok 19: Mother Earth bewailed while she is ruptured with spears also that are 
			similar to thunderbolts, besides with very gruelling ploughs. [1-39-19]

Shlok 20: Oh, Raghava, there emerged an unbearable rumpus from the serpents, 
			asura-s, demons, and other beings living underneath the surface of earth, 
			while they are killed during hollowing the earth. [1-39-20]

Shlok 21: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, thus sixty thousand square 
			yojana-s of the earth is dug over, so as to make the earth's outermost 
			plane as the unsurpassed rasaatala, the 
			sixth subterranean and the nethermost plane. [1-39-21]

Shlok 22: Oh, the tigerly king Rama, the sons of Sagara have endeavoured everywhere 
			digging over the Jambu Island which is verily congested with mountains 
			in this way. [1-39-22]

[Commentary] The jambudwiipa is a continent according to Hindu mythology 
			where the total continents listed are seven.
			
			jambuuplakShaakhyadviipau shaalmaliH ca aparo dvija | kushaH krauncaH 
			tathaa shakaH puShkaraH ca eva ca saptamaH the seven continents 
			are jambu- plakSha - shaalmali- kusha - kraunca - shaka - puSkara, 
			and jambudwiipa is one among them.

Shlok 23: All the gods along with gandharva-s, asura-s, and reptiles who are 
			distraught at heart for the plight of earth have approached the Forefather, 
			Brahma. [1-39-23]

Shlok 24: They the gods who are very highly scared, and who are chap-fallen, 
			then spoke this sentence to the great-souled Forefather Brahma on gaining 
			his grace. [1-39-24]

Shlok 25: 'Oh, god Brahma, the sons of Sagara are digging entire earth, thus 
			aquatic beings and many great-souls are being destroyed. [1-39-25]

Shlok 26: " 'This one is the destroyer of our ritual... this one has carried off 
			our ritual horse...' thinking thus and suspecting everyone those sons 
			of Sagara are torturing all the living beings.' Thus all the gods have 
			appealed to Brahma." So said Sage Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-39-26]



SARGA 40
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishwamitra's narration of Sagara's legend is continued. Sagara's 
			sons dig out all the quarters of earth and when they enter northeast 
			to find out the horse thief, there they find Sage Kapila, i.e., Vishnu 
			in the semblance of a sage. When they wanted to attack that sage Kapila, 
			he renders them to heaps of ashes by his yogic powers.

Shlok 1: "On hearing the words of gods, the esteemed Forefather Brahma spoke 
			to them, who are very highly scared, and bewildered by the might of 
			Sagara's sons for they are effectuating the end of all beings." Vishvamitra 
			thus continued his narration. [1-40-1]

Shlok 2- 3: To whom this Mother Earth belongs in all her entirety, he is that 
			prescient Vasudeva, and she is also the consort of that Maadhava, and 
			that Vishnu eternally props up Mother Earth. Hence, that reverential 
			Vishnu donning the semblance of Sage Kapila will burn down the sons 
			of emperor Sagara to ashes in a fire of fury. [1-40-2, 3]

[Commentary] The islands / continents on earth, dviipa-s, are 'jambu- plaksha 
			- shaalmali- kusha - kraunca - shaka - puSkara'. And they are the seven 
			continents. Some say the earth is having nine continents, yet some others 
			prefer eighteen. However entire globe bhuudevi belongs to 
			Vishnu as she is his another consort.

Shlok 4: 'Even the complete cleavage of the earth, and the complete ruination 
			of Sagara's sons as well, are envisaged by the providentially farsighted 
			ancients." So said Brahma to gods. [1-40-4]

[Commentary] This is the cosmic routine. Every day of Brahma is one kalpa 
			and in each kalpa Brahma starts to create the universe afresh. 
			Though it is just like the bygone creation it is anew, but the presiding 
			souls of each object of the universe will change. If one soul presides 
			the Sun or the Moon in this era, in the next era they attain a higher 
			step in the ladder of 'snakes and ladders' called vaikunThapaali 
			and a soul-in-wait takes up the job of that Sun or Moon, just as good 
			as the promotions of officials. In this cosmic destruction even the 
			gods or godlike entities will be destroyed if they tend to cause unnecessary 
			ruination to the living beings 
			anena bahupraaNyupadravakaariNaam devaa api vadhopaayam abhiipsanti 
			- daivahataanaam ca teShaam avicaareNa naasho bhavati eveti suucitam 
			-dk This is the same even in the case of Indra. Vishnu 
			in His Trivikrama incarnation blesses the demonic Emperor Bali with 
			such Indra-hood in some era, when Bali's sin is counted down, and when 
			merit accrues.

Shlok 5: On hearing the words of the Forefather Brahma all the thirty three 
			gods went away with utmost satisfaction, as they have came. [1-40-5]

[Commentary] The gods that have come to appeal to Brahma are said to be thirty-three 
			in numbers. It is not that all the count of all the gods who have come. 
			There are others besides the prominent groups of thirty-three god-groups. 
			The thirty-three primary god-groups who have come here are aSTavasu-s 
			 'eight Vasu gods' ekaadasharudraa-s 'eleven Rudra 
			gods' ashvinidvaya twin brothers called 'ashvini-gods,' those 
			that are mostly connected with the administration of earth.

Shlok 6: When the sons of Sagara are digging the earth then there emerged an 
			unbearable noise similar to the crashing of a thunder. [1-40-6]

Shlok 7: Then on hollowing the entire earth, and on making trips around her 
			without finding the horse, all of the sons of Sagara have come together 
			and on going to their father they spoke these words to him. [1-40-7]

Shlok 8- 9: 'Entire earth is trekked and mighty beings like gods, demons, monsters, 
			evil-spirits, fiends, serpents, naga-s are also eliminated, but we have 
			not seen the ritual-horse or its stealer. What we have to do next. Let 
			a thought be given in this matter. Let safeness betide you.' So said 
			those princes to their father Sagara. [1-40-8, 9]

Shlok 10: On hearing that sentence of his sons, oh, Rama, descendent of Raghu, 
			that exalted king Sagara infuriately spoke these words. [1-40-10]

Shlok 11: 'Let the earth be dug further, may safety be with you, and verily 
			splitting open the surface of the earth you catch hold of the thief 
			of the horse, and on achieving your purpose you may return to me.' In 
			this way Sagara ordered his sons. [1-40-11]

Shlok 12: On catching up the words of their father, the great-souled Sagara, 
            his sixty thousand sons rushed towards the surface of the rasaatala, 
            the netherworld. [1-40-12]

[Commentary] The last but one mantle of the earth from its crust to its inner core, 
			is called rasaatala, in the seven-tier planes called, 
			atala, vitala, sutala, talaatala, rasaatala, paataala.. These are 
			not hells.

Shlok 13: While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly 
			elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth's 
			surface on its head. [1-40-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha 
			is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests 
			on its head. [1-40-14]

Shlok 15: On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant 
			moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will 
			occur on earth. [1-40-15]

Shlok 16: They circumambulated the great elephant in supplication, oh Rama, and 
			on worshipping that elephant which is the protector of easterly direction 
			they proceeded to netherworld duly splitting the earth. [1-40-16]

Shlok 17- 18: After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern 
			direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that 
			is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly 
			side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable 
			character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. 
			[1-40-17, 18]

Shlok 19: On circumabulating that elephant Mahaapada in supplication, they the 
			sixty thousand sons of great-souled Sagara scooped out the westerly 
			direction. [1-40-19]

Shlok 20: Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld 
			an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called 
			Sumanasa. [1-40-20]

Shlok 21: Circumambulating that elephant namely Sumanasa in western side, and 
			even on asking about its well-being, then they reached the northern 
			direction duly digging the earth. [1-40-21]

Shlok 22: In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white 
			elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth. 
			[1-40-22]

Shlok 23: On touching that elephant reverently and also circumambulating it, 
			those sixty thousands sons of Sagara further burrowed to the surface 
			of the earth. [1-40-23]

Shlok 24: The sons of Sagara have then gone to the auspicious northeast direction,
			iishaana-digbhaaga, Shiva-sthaana, and 
			all those sons of Sagara have tunnelled the earth rancorously. [1-40-24]

Shlok 25- 26: But all those great-souled and great-mighty ones with terrible dash 
			have seen the Infinite Vasudeva in the form of sage Kapila there in 
			the northeast, and oh, descendant of Raghu, they have also seen the 
			ritual-horse moving nearby that sage Kapila, thus all of the sons of 
			Sagara obtained a matchless delight. [1-40-25, 26]

Shlok 27- 28a: The eyes of the princes are agitated in fury in construing the sage 
			Kapila as the stealer of ritual-horse, and they furiously dashed towards 
			him wielding crowbars, ploughs, and various trees and boulders, and 
			shouting at him, 'stay, stay.' [1-40-27, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: You the malicious one, you have indeed stolen our ritual-horse, and 
			in fact, you should know that we who arrived here are the sons of Sagara.' 
			Thus Sagara's sons shouted at sage Kapila. [1-40-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: On hearing their words, oh, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, then sage 
			Kapila is beset with high wrath, and he boomed a 'hum' sound at them. 
			[1-40-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, then that great-souled sage Kapila, rather Vishnu 
			with unimaginable power, has rendered all of those sons of Sagara as 
			heaps of ashes by virtue of his 'hum' sound." Thus Sage Vishvamitra 
			is narrating the legend of Sagara to Rama and others. [1-40-30b, c]



SARGA 41
------------------------------

[Text] Amshuman's search for horse reveals that Kapila rendered his paternal-uncles 
			to ashes. When he wanted to offer water oblation as obsequies to their 
			souls he did not find water. Then Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu 
			and maternal uncle of Amshuman advises him to get River Ganga onto earth 
			whereby the souls are cleansed and they go to heaven. Amshuman reports 
			the same to King Sagara, but Sagara not finding any way to get River 
			Ganga onto earth departs to heaven at the end of his time.

Shlok 1: "On observing that his sons have gone long time back in search of ritual-horse, 
			oh, Rama, king Sagara spoke this to his grandson, Amshuman, who is radiant 
			with his own self-resplendence." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration 
			about Sagara. [1-41-1]

Shlok 2: 'You are brave one and completed your education in warfare, such as 
			you are, you are a coequal to your paternal-uncles in magnificence, 
			thus you search the course of your paternal uncles, also him by whom 
			the horse is stolen.' Thus King Sagara started speaking to his grandson 
			Amshuman. [1-41-2]

Shlok 3: The living beings in netherworlds of earth are intrepid and they 
			are extraordinary also, hence you take your bow along with your sword 
			to retaliate them in the event of their attacking you. [1-41-3]

Shlok 4: 'On saluting them that are worthy for salutations, and on eliminating 
			them that are the causer of obstructions, you shall achieve your purpose 
			of tracking the ritual-horse, and thus you comeback safely and let my 
			Vedic-ritual be crossed over to the other shore of mortality by you.' 
			Thus king Sagara told his grandson Amshuman. [1-41-4]

Shlok 5: When the great-souled king Sagara has thoroughly said in this way, 
			that adroitly agile Amshuman proceeded wielding a bow and a sword. [1-41-5]

Shlok 6: Motivated by the King Sagara, oh, Rama, the best one among men, Amshuman 
			progressed on the walkway that was hollowed out by his great-souled 
			paternal-uncles inside the earth. [1-41-6]

Shlok 7: And he that resplendent Amshuman beheld one of the four directional 
			elephant of the earth which is being venerated by gods, monsters, demons, 
			imps, vultures and serpents. [1-41-7]

Shlok 8: On circumambulating that elephant in supplication, and even on enquiring 
			after its well-being, he that Amshuman has enquired in detail with it 
			for his paternal-uncles and even about the robber of the ritual-horse. 
			[1-41-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing that enquiry of Amshuman that directional elephant with 
			great perception replied on its part saying, 'oh Amshuman, son of Asamanja, 
			on achieving your mission you will return expeditiously along with the 
			horse'. [1-41-9]

Shlok 10: On hearing that word of that directional elephant he departed from 
			there, and on sequentially reaching other directional elephants that 
			are abiding in other directions of earth, he commenced to ask the same 
			enquiry which he made with the first, according to the positioning of 
			elephants in directions, and according to the established procedures 
			of their venerability. [1-41-10]

Shlok 11: All the elephants that safeguard the directions of earth which have 
			the faculties of articulation and eloquence have adored Amshuman and 
			motivated him by saying, 'you will be going from here taking the horse.' 
			[1-41-11]

Shlok 12: On hearing that common blessing of all the directional-elephants, he 
			that nimble-footed Amshuman has gone to the place where his paternal-uncles, 
			sons of Sagara, were rendered as mounds of ashes. [1-41-12]

Shlok 13: But he on whom the control of anguish has chanced for not physically 
			seeing his paternal-uncles, that son of Asamanja then wept, as he is 
			highly agonised and extremely anguished at their destruction. [1-41-13]

Shlok 14: That tigerly-man Amshuman who is overwhelmed by agony and anguish, 
			also beheld there the horse of Vedic-ritual that is grazing nearby. 
			[1-41-14]

Shlok 15: When he that great resplendent Amshuman wanted to offer obsequial waters 
			to the departed sons of Sagara and searched for water he has not found 
			any fount of water. [1-41-15]

Shlok 16: Spanning his expert glances, oh, Rama, he then saw the rapid-winged 
			king of birds, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, who is the 
			maternal uncle of his father and other paternal-uncles, and whose flight 
			will be similar to that of the Wind-god. [1-41-16]

Shlok 17: That great-mighty son of Lady Vinata, namely Garuda, also spoke this 
			word to Amshuman, 'do not bemoan, oh, tigerly-man, this eradication 
			of your paternal-uncles is worthwhile to the worlds'. [1-41-17]

Shlok 18: In fact, Kapila, the Imponderable Sage, has burnt down those great-mighty 
			paternal-uncles of yours, oh, observant Amshuman, as such it will not 
			be apt of you to offer the mundane obsequial water-oblations to them, 
			indeed. [1-41-18]

Shlok 19: 'Oh, best one among men, River Ganga is the elder daughter of 
			Himavanta, and oh, dextrous one, you have to offer water-oblation to 
			the departed paternal-uncles of yours in her waters, namely the holy 
			waters of River Ganga'. [1-41-19]

Shlok 20: World purifier River Ganga will drift them who are rendered as mounds 
			of ashes to heaven, and when she who is much adored by all worlds drenches 
			this ash, that River Ganga herself will lead the sixty-thousand sons 
			of Sagara to heaven. [1-41-20]

Shlok 21: 'Oh, great fortunate one, oh, best one among men, you may proceed 
			from here with the horse, oh, brave one, it will be apt of you to carry 
			out the Vedic-ritual of your grandfather.' Thus Garuda said to Amshuman. 
			[1-41-21]

Shlok 22: On hearing the words of that great-winged eagle, Garuda, he that highly 
			brave and well-renowned Amshuman swiftly took the horse, and returned 
			to the ritual place of his grandfather, king Sagara. [1-41-22]

Shlok 23: Then on reaching the King Sagara, who is under the vow of the ritual, 
			oh, Rama, Amshuman described what all has happened and even the words 
			of Garuda. [1-41-23]

Shlok 24: On hearing those unendurable words from Amshuman, the king Sagara firstly 
			completed the Vedic-ritual scripturally and procedurally. [1-41-24]

Shlok 25: On completing the Vedic-ritual King Sagara arrived at his capital, 
			but that king could not arrive at a decision about the arrival of Ganga 
			to the earth. [1-41-25]

Shlok 26: "That great king Sagara could not get at any resolve in getting Ganga 
			to earth even after a long time, and on ruling kingdom for thirty-thousand 
			years he went to heaven." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
			the ancestors of Rama. [1-41-26]



SARGA 42
------------------------------

[Text] Bhageeratha's effort for bringing Ganga to earth is fulfilled. Amshuman 
			and his son Dileepa could not make any effort to bring the divine river 
			to earth. But Bhageeratha, the son of Dileepa, staunch at heart tries 
			earnestly to get her onto earth. Brahma agreeing for this descent of 
			Ganga designates lord Shiva to bear the burden of the onrush of Ganga, 
			because the earth cannot sustain it.

Shlok 1: "When King Sagara passed away owing to the irrefutable virtue of Time, 
			the ministers and subjects of that kingdom are predisposed towards the 
			highly honourable Amshuman to become their king and they enthroned him 
			accordingly." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration about the predecessors 
			of Rama. [1-42-1]

Shlok 2: "He that Amshuman turned out to be a very great king, and oh, Rama of 
			Raghu's delight, he begot a marvellous son who is renowned as Dileepa. 
			[1-42-2]

Shlok 3: Assigning the kingdom to Dileepa, oh, Rama of Raghu's dynasty, Amshuman 
			undertook very stern ascesis on a pleasant peak of Himalayas desiring 
			the descent of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-3]

Shlok 4: On practising ascesis in ascetic-woods for thirty-two thousand years 
			that highly renowned king Amshuman achieved heaven as he acquired only 
			the wealth of practising the ascesis. [1-42-4]

[Commentary] Instead of achieving reward of ascesis in the form of descent of River 
			Ganga, he could achieve only his personal merit of his penance, namely 
			an abode in heaven.

Shlok 5: The great resplendent Dileepa on hearing the elimination of his grandfathers, 
			the sixty thousand sons of Sagara at the hand of sage Kapila, and with 
			a mind that is marred by the plight of his father Amshuman in absolving 
			the souls of Sagara's sons, he that Dileepa could not arrive at any 
			decision concerning the descent of Ganga. [1-42-5]

Shlok 6: Dileepa became worried as to how River Ganga is to be alighted onto 
			earth from heaven, how water-oblations are to be offered for the souls 
			of Sagara's sons, and how to cross them, the souls, over this mortal 
			world. [1-42-6]

Shlok 7: To him who is self-mortified and who is always thinking righteously 
			about the alight of Ganga onto earth, to such a Dileepa a most-virtuous 
			son is born who is renowned by his name Bhageeratha. [1-42-7]

Shlok 8: That great-resplendent king Dileepa on his part performed numerous 
			Vedic-rituals, and he ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years - 
			to the delight of each of his subjects, but could not find a way to 
			fetch Ganga. [1-42-8]

Shlok 9: Oh, tigerly-man Rama, that king Dileepa by not attaining any choice 
			towards the uplifting the souls of his grandparents to heaven by bringing 
			Ganga to earth, he took to illness, and he attained the ultimate virtue 
			of Time, namely the demise. [1-42-9]

Shlok 10: That best one among men, namely king Dileepa, on anointing his son 
			Bhageeratha in the kingdom went to the abode of Indra, namely the heaven, 
			only by his self-acquired merits of deeds. [1-42-10]

Shlok 11: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, but on his part that self-righteous 
			and kingly-sage Bhageeratha is childless, and that great king longed-for 
			offspring. [1-42-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: Interested in the alighting of River Ganga on earth, oh, Rama, the 
			descendent of Raghu, king Bhageeratha delegated his kingdom to the custody 
			of his ministers and people and firmed up himself in sustained asceticism 
			on Mt. Gokarna in Himalayas, and he practise ascesis standing amid five-fires, 
			upraising his hands, with a monthly sustenance and with his sense conquered. 
			[1-42-12, 13a]

[Commentary] The five-fires are pancaagni-s the four earthly fires in four 
			corners of directions and the sun's fire overhead.

Shlok 13- 14: Thousands of years have rolled by while Bhageeratha stood practising 
			his severe ascesis, oh, dextrous Rama, and then the lord and master 
			of all beings, namely god Brahma, is well pleased with that great-souled 
			king's ascesis. [1-42-13b, 14]

Shlok 15: Forefather Brahma then arrived along with assemblages of gods, and 
			spoke this way to the great-souled Bhageeratha who is deep in the practise 
			of ascesis. [1-42-15]

Shlok 16: Oh, great king Bhageeratha, oh, lord of the people, I am delighted 
			with the perfectly conducted ascesis of yours, hence oh, truly committed 
			one, you may beseech for a boon. [1-42-16]

Shlok 17: That great resplendent and highly fortunate king Bhageeratha then remaining 
			with suppliantly adjoined palm fold spoke to him who is the Forefather 
			of all worlds, namely Brahma. [1-42-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, god, if you are satisfied with my ascesis, and if there is any 
			fruition to the ascesis of mine, let all the sons of Sagara get water 
			oblations through me. [1-42-18]

Shlok 19: While the ashes of these great souls are drenched with the waters 
			of Ganga, let all of those great-grandfathers of mine depart to heaven, 
			eternally. [1-42-19]

Shlok 20: Oh, god, I indeed pray for offspring in our Ikshvaku dynasty, let 
			not our dynasty dwindle as I am issueless, and oh, god, let this be 
			the other boon to me. [1-42-20]

Shlok 21: The Forefather of all the worlds, Brahma, then replied the king who 
			has spoken in that way, in an auspicious tongue that is sweet-sounding 
			and sweetly worded, as well. [1-42-21]

Shlok 22: Oh, top-speeded chariot-rider Bhageeratha, this aspiration of yours 
			is sublime, and oh, the furtherer of Ikshvaku dynasty, so be it, let 
			safeness betide you. [1-42-22]

Shlok 23: This Ganga is the one with snow-broth, the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			and oh, king Bhageeratha, god Shiva alone is capable to sustain her 
			force in the course of her alighting onto earth, and in fact, he is 
			to be commissioned for that purpose. [1-42-23]

Shlok 24: 'Oh, king Bhageeratha, the earth cannot endure the downfall of Ganga 
			and to sustain Ganga, oh, king, indeed I do not behold none other than 
			the Trident-wielder, god Shiva.' Thus Brahma spoke to Bhageeratha. [1-42-24]

Shlok 25: "Speaking this way to the king Bhageeratha and informally greeting Ganga 
			also, that Creator of Worlds, Brahma, left for heaven along with all 
			the groups of gods and Wind-gods." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration 
			about the arrival of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-25]



SARGA 43
------------------------------

[Text] Ganga descends to earth by the extraordinary effort of Bhageeratha. 
			Shiva agrees to the alighting of Ganga on His head and from where she 
			is released into a lake called Bindu sarovar, and from there she flows 
			in seven courses. On land Bhageeratha ushers her up to netherworld dug 
			by his ancestors where heaps of ashes of his grandparents are there, 
			and she enters accordingly to inundate those mounds of ashes according 
			salvation to the souls.

Shlok 1: "When the god of gods Brahma left from there Bhageeratha stood on the 
			tip of his big-toe praying for the mercy of Lord Shiva for one year, 
			while that tip of his big-toe pressurised the earth." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about Bhageeratha's effort to bring Ganga to 
			earth. [1-43-1]

[Commentary] Bhageeratha stood on one big-toe with an unwavering intent and bodily 
			movement, and with his hands upraised in prayer for a period of one 
			year by day and night, sustaining himself on mere air, and thus his 
			yogic concentration increased and that alone pressurised the earth.

Shlok 2: On completion of one year, he who is venerated by all worlds, the consort 
			of Uma and the god of animals from insects to humans, that god Shiva 
			revealed himself and spoke this to the king. [1-43-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, best one among humans, I am delighted with your unwavering effort, 
			and I will fulfil your cherish. I will therefore sustain Ganga, the 
			daughter of king of mountains by my head. [1-43-3]

Shlok 4- 5a: Afterwards, she who is reverenced by all the worlds and who is the 
			elder daughter of Himavanta, that Ganga assuming an unendurable form 
			and an insupportable rapidity, they say, then plunged from the sky onto 
			the auspicious head of Shiva. [1-43-4, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: She who is an extremely unendurable river that goddess Ganga even speculated 
			saying to herself, 'let me enter netherworld, indeed whisking Shiva 
			with my streams.' [1-43-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Discerning her egotism god Shiva is infuriated, and then on his part 
			that Three-eyed god Shiva thought to pent her up in the tufts of his 
			head-hair. [1-43-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: And oh, Rama, she that holy River Ganga swooped down into the cavernous 
			curls of matted hair-tufts on the holy head of God Shiva, and she became 
			a detainee in them. [1-43-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: Though she strove hard in one way or another to reach the earth that 
			Ganga is rendered incapable, as she could not gain access for an outlet 
			from any edge of the coils of matted hair-tufts of Shiva, hence she 
			is held there in durance vile. [1-43-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Goddess Ganga whirled round and round in the coils of tufts alone for 
			many number of years, and when Ganga's emanation from those coils is 
			intangible Bhageeratha again firmed up in a marvellous penance in the 
			matter of her descent to earth. [1-43-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, with that ascesis of Bhageeratha god 
			Shiva is very much delighted, and thereupon he has also released Ganga 
			aiming at Bindu Lake in Himalayas. [1-43-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: While god Shiva released Ganga into Bindu Lake seven streams have emerged 
			out of it, and thus three auspicious Ganga-s with holy waters have cruised 
			eastward which are known as Hlaadini, Paavani, and Nalini. [1-43-11b, 
			12]

Shlok 13: Also thus Sucakshu, Seetha, and the excellent river Sindhu are the 
			other three rivers which streamed to the westward direction with their 
			holy waters. [1-43-13]

Shlok 14- 15a: Of them the seventh Ganga flowed towards the path of Bhageeratha' chariot, 
			and that great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting in a 
			divine chariot moved ahead and even Ganga followed him. [1-43-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Thus Ganga came from heavens onto Shankara's head and from there onto 
			the earth, and there on earth her waters advanced with a tumultuous 
			sound advancing them. [1-43-15b, 16a]

[Commentary] The River Ganga is also called as tripathagaa 'she courses 
			in three ways...' of which one kind of thinking is that she flowed from 
			Himalayas to heaven, from heaven to Shiva's head and from there to earth. 
			In the above context also, she is said to have the three-way-flow, i.e., 
			one is eastward flow, second westward flow and the third is southward 
			flow as led by Bhageeratha. The westward river Sindhu is the Indus and 
			the eastward Nalini, which is now called as river Brahmaputra, while 
			Ganga proper courses a little to south to move towards the ocean.

Shlok 16b- 17a: The earth then verily shone forth with the shoals of fish, schools 
			of tortoises, and scores of porpoises and other aquatic beings that 
			have already fallen and that are still falling in step with the spates 
			of Ganga. [1-43-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Later, they the gods, sages, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and the assemblages 
			of siddha-s have then seen there the swoop of Ganga in that way from 
			heaven to earth, with curiosity. [1-43-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Some of the gods with aircrafts that are like cities in their shape 
			and size, and some with horses that are prancing, and some with best 
			elephants that are staggering, at the very sight of plunging Ganga, 
			have entered the firmament at that place. [1-43-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: The gods whose animation is unlimited, and who are anxious to see the 
			plunge of Ganga, have come together in assemblages, which plunge is 
			a highest marvel in the universe by a better degree of her illimitable 
			animation than that of gods who came to see, and even benignant to the 
			world in according water and salving souls, which those gods cannot 
			do. [1-43-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "The glitter of the ornaments of hosts of gods who are in stampede, 
			made the cloudless sky to shine as if it is with a hundred of suns. 
			[1-43-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: At that time, with the falling and rising of scores of porpoises and 
			reptiles, even with the wriggling fishes, the sky became flashy as if 
			flashes of lightning are strewn over it. [1-43-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Spattered innumerably with the whitish froth from the splashes of Ganga, 
			and stippled with the flights of swans, the sky is as though overspread 
			with silver-clouds of autumn. [1-43-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately, elsewhere sinuously, somewhere 
			else straightly, elsewhere sloppily, somewhere gushingly, and somewhere 
			else her cruise is leisurely and tardily. [1-43-23b, 24a]



Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately in declivities, elsewhere 
			sinuously on zigzag lands, somewhere else straightly on uniform lands, 
			elsewhere sloppily in canting lands, somewhere gushingly in craggy lands, 
			and somewhere else her cruise is leisurely in flatlands and tardily 
			in uplands.

Shlok 24b- 25a: Somewhere her water repeatedly knocking against her own water is recurrently 
			billowing upwards only to make nosedive onto earth. [1-43-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: That impeccable and immaculate water of Ganga then became outstanding 
			as it has flounced down from heaven primarily onto the head of Shankara, 
			and therefrom it has coasted down onto the earth. [1-43-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: And asserting that the water as holy, because it descended touching 
			the body of Shiva, viz., the head of Shiva, the assemblages of sages, 
			gandharva-s, and those that are residents on the plane of earth have 
			sipped that water at that place. [1-43-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: Also those that have fallen from heaven onto the surface of earth by 
			some curse or the other, they too became blemishless on taking head-bath 
			in the water of Ganga. [1-43-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: When sins are washed away with the hallowing water of Ganga, they again 
			transited skyward and then obtained their own empyrean worlds once again. 
			[1-43-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: With her splendorous water people are blissful, and on taking dip-baths 
			in Ganga they are totally removed of the strains of their sins, and 
			they lived blissfully ever after. [1-43-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: In this way, the great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting 
			in a divine chariot continuously moved ahead and Ganga continually followed 
			him at his behind. [1-43-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] This verse is almost similar to the verse No. 14 above. But here, the 
			continuous actions of both the leader and the led are implied with ellipses 
			- 'in this way', and 'continuously.'

Shlok 31b- 32- 33a: Oh, Rama, all of the gods along with the assemblages of sages, ogres, 
			monsters, demons, and even great reptiles with kinnara-s, and gandharva-s 
			with best yaksha-s, and even serpents and apsara-s, have delightfully 
			moved after Ganga who is following the chariot of Bhageeratha, and why 
			they, in fact, all of the aquatic beings have followed Ganga. [31b, 
			32, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: In whichever direction king Bhageeratha has advanced, that glorious 
			River Ganga, who is the prominent river among all the rivers and the 
			complete obliterator of sins, has also moved at his behind in that direction. 
			[1-43-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: While in flow she started to completely inundate the field of Vedic-ritual 
			belonging to the great-souled sage Jahnu, who is of marvellous deeds 
			and who is presently an officiator of an ongoing Vedic-ritual. [1-43-34b, 
			35a]

Shlok 35b- 36a: But on knowing her hubris, oh, Raghava, that sage Jahnu has become 
			irritated and causing an extreme marvel he drank off all the water of 
			Ganga. [1-43-35b, 36a]

Shlok 36b- 37: Thereupon, the gods along with gandharva-s and sages at that extremely 
			marvellous feat of Sage Jahnu are highly astounded, and they then started 
			to worship that ablest human and great-souled sage Jahnu, and even deigned 
			for the daughterhood of Ganga to that high-souled sage Jahnu. [1-43-36b, 
			37]

Shlok 38: That greatly radiant and godly sage Jahnu is then delighted and released 
			Ganga from both of his ears. Therefore Ganga became the daughter of 
			sage Jahnu, and she is also renowned as Jahnavi, after the name of that 
			sage. [1-43-38]

Shlok 39- 40a: Even though Ganga again proceeded moving behind the chariot of Bhageeratha 
			and reached the ocean, therefrom she had to wend her way to netherworld, 
			once dug by the sons of Sagara, only to accomplish the mission of Bhageeratha, 
			namely drenching the ashes of Sagara's sons. [1-43-39, 40a]

[Commentary] Some take the word saagaram as the netherworld dug by the sons 
			of Sagara and omit the mention of her ocean-bound travel.

Shlok 40b- 41a: Even kingly-sage Bhageeratha making every effort ushered Ganga to netherworld, 
			but on seeing his grandparents rendered to ashes he has became doleful. 
			[1-43-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b: "Oh, Rama, the best of Raghu's dynasty, then Ganga inundated that mound 
			of ashes of Sagara's six-thousand sons, by which those souls obtained 
			heaven, while the sins of souls are cleansed with the water of Ganga." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-43-41b, c]



SARGA 44
------------------------------

[Text] Brahma commends Bhageeratha in bringing Ganga onto earth which none 
			of his ancestors could do. Brahma blesses Ganga to be the daughter of 
			Bhageeratha. Brahma advises him to offer water-oblations to his manes 
			with the sanctified waters of Ganga.

Shlok 1: "King Bhageeratha followed by Ganga has gone to the ocean-like ditch 
			which is dredged up by the sons of Sagara, and entered the subterranean 
			of earth where the sons of Sagara are rendered to ashes." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about the Descent of Ganga. [1-44-1]

Shlok 2: While the waters of Ganga are inundating those ashes, oh, Rama, then 
			Brahma, the lord of all worlds, indeed spoke this to the king Bhageeratha. 
			[1-44-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, tigerly-man Bhageeratha, the sixty thousands sons of great souled 
			Sagara have crossed over the sea of mortality, and on a par with the 
			gods they have also transited to heaven. [1-44-3]

Shlok 4: As long as the water of the ocean abides in the world, oh, king, 
			so long the sons of Sagara will abide in heaven like gods. [1-44-4]

Shlok 5: This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and hereafter she will 
			remain renowned in the world with the name associated with your deed 
			of bringing her onto earth. [1-44-5]

[Commentary] Otherwise, 'by your fatherhood she will be called Bhaageerathi and your 
			names becomes her surname.'

Shlok 6: Henceforth heavenly Ganga will be renowned as 'Triple-path-cruiser' 
			and 'Bhaageerathi,' as well, and as this river is sanctifying three 
			worlds, namely, svarga, bhuu, paataala loka-s, 
			'heaven, earth and netherworld' she will be remembered as the traveller 
			on triple path. [1-44-6]

Shlok 7: You may now offer water-oblations to all of your forefathers in the 
			waters of Ganga, oh, king, the lord of people, thus you may fulfil and 
			do away with the pledge of your requiescat. [1-44-7]

Shlok 8: Your ancestor Sagara is a highly glorious one and a best one 
			among righteous persons, oh, king, even then he has not achieved this 
			aspiration of alighting Ganga in his lifetime, but you have achieved 
			it. [1-44-8]

Shlok 9: Like that, your grandfather Amshuman, who is unequalled in his resplendence 
			in this world and who had been praying for the descent of Ganga, he 
			also could not dispense with this vow on fulfilling it. [1-44-9]

Shlok 10- 11: Oh, impeccable Bhageeratha, even by the kingly-sage Dileepa whose 
			resplendence is kindred to great sages, who is equal to me in his ascesis, 
			who is abided by the observances of ruling Kshatriya class, even by 
			such a highly fortunate and highly resplendent father of yours it was 
			impossible to bring Ganga in his turn, even though he had been supplicating 
			for the descent of Ganga throughout his lifetime. [1-44-10, 11]

[Commentary] The content of verse 10 at times will be attributed to verse 9, viz., 
			to Amshuman, rather than to Dileepa.

Shlok 12: But, you have accomplished that pledge, oh, the best one among men, 
			and in the world you have achieved highest renown which is highly adorable 
			by all. [1-44-12]

Shlok 13: That 'Descent of Ganga' is perfected by you, oh, enemy-represser, 
			and by this you have acquired a genuine basis for righteousness in this 
			world, and thereby a base for yourself in my world, namely Abode of 
			Brahma. [1-44-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, phenomenal one, you may always take dip-baths in the holy water 
			of Ganga and oh, persona grata, thereby get purified of sins and thus 
			let your merit be fructified. [1-44-14]

[Commentary] The waters of other rivers have a blemish called rajasvala doSa 
			'the blemish of menstruation.' When the sun is in Leo-Cancer, i.e., 
			during monsoon, and when new waters come in, it is as good as menstruation 
			for the ladies called, the rivers. But Ganga is beyond these taboos 
			because it is perennial, hence her is sanctifying. Some more details 
			are given in endnote of this chapter.

Shlok 15: 'You may now perform water-oblations to your forefathers with the 
			water of Ganga, let there be wellbeing to you, and oh, king, here I 
			go to my abode and you too may depart to yours.' Thus Brahma said to 
			Bhageeratha. [1-44-15]

Shlok 16: On saying in this way, the forefather of all the worlds, and the great 
			glorious lord of all gods, namely Brahma, went away to his empyrean 
			world as he has came. [1-44-16]

Shlok 17: On according those best water-oblations that endow superior realms 
			to the souls of sons of Sagara, according to precedency and the rationale 
			of scriptures, and even on offering water-oblations to other manes that 
			kingly-sage and greatly renowned Bhageeratha is sanctified, and then 
			only that king re-entered his own city, indeed when his purpose is completely 
			achieved, and oh, outstanding man Rama, thus that king Bhageeratha ruled 
			his kingdom well. [1-44-17, 18]

Shlok 19: On regaining him as their king the subjects of the kingdom are overjoyed, 
			and oh, Raghava, that king Bhageeratha too is relieved of his febrility 
			as his purpose is achieved and he is happy when devoid of haunting grief 
			of getting Ganga to earth. [1-44-19]

Shlok 20: Oh, Rama, this way I described to you about 'The Decent of Ganga' in 
			detail, thus you be blest and prosperous, and as the visceral time is 
			elapsing no more questions from you for now, and let us meditate on 
			Gayatri. But listen to the fruits of listening the legend of 
			ganga avataraNa, 'The Descent of Ganga' [1-44-20]

Shlok 21- 22a: This legend is conducive to achieve prosperity, fame, longevity, progeny 
			and even heaven, and he who narrates this legend to others, whether 
			he is from Brahmans or from Kshatriya-s, or for that matter of fact 
			from any other class, his manes will be satisfied, and gods too will 
			be gladdened. [1-44-21, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha-s, he who listens to this auspicious legend named 
			'The Descent of Gang,' which is an endower of longevity, all his wishes 
			are achieved, all his sins are obliterated, and his reputation and longevity 
			are also enhanced." Thus Vishvamitra concluded the episode of 'The Descent 
			of Ganga.' [1-44-22b, 23]

[Commentary] Almost every puraaNa, mythological treatise, deals with the sanctity of 
Ganga. It is therefore queried and counter-queried as to why and how she is sanctifying. 
Many treatises have detailed about it. This river emerges from the nail of the left 
foot's big-toe of Vishnu as said in Vishnu Puraana: gangaa devaanganaa angaanaam 
anulepanaa api pinjaraa | vaamapaadaambujaanguShTanakhasroto vinirgataa | visNorbhibharti 
yaam bhaktyaa shirasaa aharnisham dhR^ivam - sivaH Hence she took 
landing on Shiva's head. shankarasya shirasi bhraShTam patitam kalmaShaapahaa 
- maheshvara tiirtha 'the one who plunged onto Shankara's head and the very 
same is the remover of sins.'

[Commentary] Even if that river has fallen onto the head of Shiva at a later time, her original 
birth place is at the feet of Vishnu hence that river is sacred. After falling on 
the head of Shiva she is released and she rapidly flowed onto earth. Hence, her 
speed and rapidity alone are the sanctifying factors. nadii vegena shudhyati 
- govinda raaja 'a river cleanses itself by its rapidity.' As such, after incarceration 
by Shiva she flowed rapidly and thus her sanctity is kept up, by her very rapidity.

[Commentary] On bearing these sanctifying waters on his head, Shiva became a sanctified Shiva 
as said at sarit praparodakena tiirthena - candramaulividhR^itena shivaH shivo 
aabhuut - bhaagavatapuraaNa. Shiva presumed that he is honoured for the falling 
of Ganga on his head as said at tat ambupatitam dR^iShTvaa dadhaara shirasaa 
haraH | paavanaartham jaTaamadhye - mahaa bhaarata Even in aadhyaatma raaamayaNa
Sage Vashishta says to Vishnu tvat paadasalilam dhR^itvaa dhanyo bhuut 
girijaapatiH - aadhyaatma raamaayaNa 'on bearing your foot's waters Shiva 
became pious.'

[Commentary] In the legend of Trivikrama, dwarf-ascetic-boy, at one place it is said 
that due to the pressure of the foot of Vamana, the incarnation of Vishnu, the shell 
of the universe is pierced and water available outside has gone in and that water 
belonged to the Divine Ganga. At another place it is said when Brahma washed the 
feet of Vishnu that water from his kamanDulu'handy vessel' flowed as Ganga. 
Still at another place it is said that the dharmaitself flowed as Ganga 
at the behest of Brahma. These three are correlated and said that 'when Brahma washed 
the feet of Vishnu the waters were not sufficient enough to drench, then Brahma 
ordered dharmato flow like water, but that too was not enough, and when 
Vamana pierced the shell of universe then dharmaflowed as Ganga.

[Commentary] The yoga takes yet another viewpoint of Ganga. Their great guru is 
Shiva, and hence yogis say that every fraction of second Ganga, or cetana, 
vitality, flows in ones own body. tat paadapadmajam ga~Ngaam nipatantiim svamuurdhani | 
	cintayet brahmarandhreNa pravishantiim svakaam tanuum | tayaa sa~NkShaalayet 
deham baahyam abhyantaram malam | tat kShaNaat virajo mantra jaayate sphaTikopamam 
||According to the six-plexus theory cetana shakti, power of vitality, 
flows through brahma randhra'the hole in the mid of the pate' to sahasrakamalathe 
multi-petal-lotus, the Internal Capsule or the Reticular Activating 
System and from there to aaj~naa cakra' plexus of discrimination' back at 
the third eye, and from there the vitality flows down the lines of the three spinal 
nerves, viz., iDaa, pingala, suSumnasympathetic, parasympathetic and central 
spinal cord. These three are the three replicas of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. 
Their confluence occurs once at aaj~naa cakra' third eye' and again at the 
perineum and having gone to the perineum this Ganga activates the dormant particles 
of vitality to raise them up the spinal system. Thus, the Supreme Yogi Shiva ordains 
the vitality called Ganga to flow up and down the plexuses, from grey matter down 
to the perineum, only to activate the system. More Information than this will become 
unjustifiable here.

[Commentary] Ganga is ever holy because she does not have any womanly stigmas. dvimaasam 
saritah sarvaa bhavanti rajasvalaaH - maarkanDeya - - simhakarkaaTakayoH madhye 
sarvaa nadyaa rajasvalaaH - vyaaghrapaada 'for two months all the rivers menstruate' 
Maarkandeya Puraana. 'When sun in Leo-Cancer all rivers menstruate.' that is due 
to monsoon and new waters, as such bathing in them at that time is prohibitive. 
But River Ganga perennially draws its river water from Himalayas thus she has no 
such blemish.

[Commentary] For all these diverse opinions the reply is given in Ramayana itself as said in 
Ayodhya vishNupaadodbhavaam divyaam - ayodhyaand also at 1-43-7 of Ramayana
saa tasmin puNyaa - puNye rudrasya muurdhani - raamaayaNawhich imports 
the meaning: 'she that pious River Ganga, fell onto the pious head of Shiva,' i.e., 
'without any mutation, both Shiva and Ganga are the sanctifiers by themselves, while 
helping each other, i.e., Shiva helped Ganga to gain a foothold on His head, while 
Ganga helped Shiva to become the root cause to bear and release her brunt, and in 
turn, both of them helped the humankind.' Thus, what more can be sanctity than helping 
the created beings with one's own dharma.



SARGA 45
------------------------------

[Text] The legend of churning Milk Ocean is narrated to Rama and Lakshmana when they reach 
and see a city named Vishaala. Vishvamitra narrates how haalaahala, the 
lethal poison as well as Amrita, the ambrosial elixir emerged from the 
churning of Milk Ocean, and how Shiva contained the poison and how Vishnu helped 
the churning in His incarnation as Tortoise.

Shlok 1: On listening the narration of Sage Vishwamitra about Ganga's descent along with 
Lakshmana, Rama went into a great astonishment, and then addressed Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-1]

Shlok 2: The blessed legend you have narrated about the digging of an ocean at the behest 
of Sagara, Ganga's alighting, and Bhageeratha filling it with the water of Ganga 
is sacrosanct and even highly amazing. [1-45-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, enemy-inflamer, for two of us entire night rolled by as if it is a single moment 
while we were thinking about the episode you have narrated in its entirety. [1-45-3]

Shlok 4: While thinking about the auspicious legend of Ganga along with Lakshmana, oh, friend 
of the universe, Vishvamitra, whole night rolled by." Thus Rama is addressing Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-4]

[Commentary] Here the placement of verses does not give a continuity of narration in this version, 
insofar as Rama's speech is concerned. Other versions have a continuity of narration.

Shlok 5: Thereafter on the next fresh dawn the enemy-oppressor Raghava spoke these words 
to sage Vishvamitra, whose affluence is nothing but asceticism, and who by now has 
performed his daily chores of rituals. [1-45-5]

Shlok 6: We have listened the praiseworthy legend of River Ganga, and the deific night 
has also passed by while listening such a legend, we may now cross over the very 
same prominent and merited River Ganga, the tri-path-cruiser. [1-45-6]

Shlok 7: "This boat which is suitable for the embarkation of the sages whose deeds are pious, 
and which is comfortably blanketed with mats in its deck has come here, and indeed 
on knowing about the visit of your holiness to this place the sages have fetched 
it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-45-7]

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of great-souled Raghava, Vishvamitra of Kusha dynasty, started 
to cross over the River Ganga along with the assemblage of sages, and with both 
the Raghava-s. [1-45-8]

Shlok 9: Arriving at the northern bank of River Ganga they have honoured the group of sages 
who ferried them up to here and sent them off. Then sojourning on the riverbank 
of Ganga they have seen the city called Vishaala. [1-45-9]

Shlok 10: The great sage Vishvamitra then quickly started along with Rama and Lakshmana to 
the charming and admirable city Vishaala, which in comparison is like heaven. [1-45-10]

Shlok 11: Then Rama, whose flair for knowing everything is high, became suppliant duly adjoining 
his palms, and enquired about the prominent city Vishala with the great Sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-11]

Shlok 12: "Oh, great sage, which dynasty of kings is ruling from this city of Vishaala? Let 
safeness betide you, I am interested to hear of it and indeed I am highly inquisitive 
about it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1- 45-12]

Shlok 13: Hearing that sentence of Rama then the eminent sage Vishvamitra has commenced to 
narrate the legend of ancient Vishaala. [1-45-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, Rama, I will tell you about the auspicious legend of Indra as I was told, and 
you listen to it as I tell. Oh, Raghava, indeed you may now listen to the quintessence 
of what has happened in this country. [1-45-14]

Shlok 15: Once in Krita era, oh, Rama, the sons of Lady Diti were extremely energetic, whereas 
the sons of her younger sister Lady Aditi were vigorous and highly righteous. [1-45-15]

[Commentary] Diti is the elder sister of Aditi and the first wife of Sage Kaashyapa. Her sons 
were originally called asura-s, and later given the nomenclature 
of raakshasaa-s, the demons. Lady Aditi the second wife of that sage Kaashyapa, 
gave birth to the progeny of sura-s, later generally called as
devataa-s, the gods. These two ladies are the daughters of Daksha Prajaapati.

Shlok 16: "Oh, tigerly-man, Rama, then those great-souls speculated as to 'how we can thrive 
without ageing, illness, and likewise without death.' [1-45-16]

Shlok 17: A thought occurred to those masterminds who were thinking on that matter clueing 
them up, 'we indeed can get elixir of life by churning the Milky Ocean.' [1-45-17]

Shlok 18: Deciding upon to churn the Milky Ocean then made Vasuki, Thousand-headed King of 
Snakes, as the churning rope and Mt. Mandara as stirrer, and those brothers whose 
energy is unlimited have started churning the Milky Ocean thoroughly. [1-45-18]

Shlok 19: After a thousand years, the Thousand-headed serpent Vaasuki, which is being 
used as churning rope, is incapacitated to bear the friction of churning and fanged 
the cliffs of Mt. Mandara. Thereby a great lot of venom is disgorged from the heads 
of that serpent Vaasuki, which venom on melting the rocks of Mt. Mandara became 
the holocaustic poison called haalaahala. [1-45-19]

Shlok 20: A lethal poison similar to inferno known as haalaahala has started to fulminate 
therefrom, by which whole universe of gods, non-gods and humans is burnt down. [1-45-20]

Shlok 21: The gods seeking shelter then approached Rudra, the Cardinal God, Endower of Solace, 
and who husbands all the created animals inclusive of human-animals, namely Shiva, 
and they prayed to him saying 'save, save us.' [1-45-21]

Shlok 22: This way while the gods are praying the Lord and God of Gods, namely Shiva, then 
handling his disc and conch-shell Vishnu has also revealed himself at that place. 
[1-45-22]

Shlok 23: And Vishnu smilingly spoke to wielder of trident Rudra, 'oh, god the best, whatever 
element that has emerged from the churning of Milk Ocean by gods, that shall belong 
to you, isn't it. By virtue of your position as the foremost god among gods, oh, 
omnicompetent god Shiva, you please accept this poison applying yourself to that 
position of foremost god, and deeming this poison, haalahala, as a foremost oblation 
to your godhood'. [1-45-23, 24]

Shlok 25- 26a: Saying so Vishnu, the best one among gods, has disappeared then and there only. 
And on observing the scare of gods and also on paying heed to the words of the Wielder 
of Bow called shaar~Nga, namely Vishnu, god Shiva gulped that lethal poison,
haalaahala , as if it is ambrosia. [1-45-25, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: The god of gods Hara then left for his abode Kailash parting with other gods, and 
oh, Rama, the joy of Raghu's dynasty, the gods and non-gods have continued to churn 
the Milky Ocean. [1-45-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: Now the loftiest mountain that is being used as stirrer, namely Mt. Mandara, has 
caved into the netherworld, thereby the gods along with gandharva-s have prayed 
to Madhusuudana, the other name of Vishnu. [1-45-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: 'You alone are the recourse to all beings, especially to the dwellers in heavens, 
oh ambidextrous god Vishnu, you safeguard us, it will be apt of you elevate the 
mountain.' So prayed gods to Vishnu. [1-45-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Hearing the prayer of gods Vishnu, Hrisheekesha, the controller of senses, adopting 
the form of a tortoise and positioning the stirring Mt. Mandara on that tortoiseshell, 
he lay recumbent at the bottom of Milky Ocean as a base to the stirrer. [1-45-29b, 
30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: Keshava then reached out his hand and grasped the mountaintop as he is the Cosmic-Soul, 
and thus staying amid gods that Supreme Person Vishnu participated in churning the 
ocean by holding the stirring mountain upright. [1-45-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32: After a thousand years of churning, then a male personality, an epitome of Life 
Sciences, namely aayurveda , a highly righteous soul, named Dhanvantari, 
has firstly surfaced with his arm-rest-stick and with his handy water-vessel, and 
then the remarkably elegant Apsara-s, angelic damsels, have emerged next to him 
from the Milky Ocean. [1-45-31b, 32]

Shlok 33: Choicest females have come out an elixir obtained on absolute churning of the waters 
of Milk Ocean, oh, best one among men, Rama, thereby that genera of females became 
Apsara-s. [1-45-33]

Shlok 34: Six hundred millions of such Apsara-s with amazing dazzle have emerged from the 
churning of Milky Ocean, oh, descendent of Kakutstha, and their maidservants who 
emerged along with them are innumerable. [1-45-34]

Shlok 35: Anybody either from gods or demons espoused them, and when none espoused them they 
are virtually reckoned as 'general-purpose' Apsara-females. [1-45-35]

[Commentary] In fact these Apsara-s are the nymphs who really did not bother to choose husbands 
either from gods or from demons and they wanted to be free and out of the institution 
of marriage. But later they alone have become breeding centres as in the case of 
Menaka-Vishvamitra et al. Because they have come out from apsu rasa 'waters... 
elixir, those that emanated from the elixir of water.' Etymologically this nomenclature 
'seems more to be guided by the similarity of sound than anything else,' and 'we 
have a case of sound etymology par excellence [in Ramayana,] in sura, asura
and the word asura is formed from the word asu with the addition 
of the suffix ra and means 'one full of ra spiritual life i.e.,
asu and 'by curious process of semantical change came to mean a demon.' 
Pt. Satya Vrat - Ramayana - A Linguistic Study.

Shlok 36: Oh, descendent of Raghu, then the heaven-sent damsel Vaaruni came up from Milky 
Ocean searching for her espousal, who is the daughter of Varuna, the Rain-god, and 
who incidentally is the presiding deity of hard liquors and also called as sura. 
[1-45-36]

Shlok 37: Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of 
Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have 
espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. [1-45-37]

Shlok 38: Thereby the sons of Diti are called asuraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are 
called suraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni. 
[1-45-38]

Shlok 39: Then a best horse called Ucchaishravaa has emerged, oh, Rama, the best among men, 
and then a gem of a jewel, called Kaustubha, and like that amrita, the 
Supreme ambrosial elixir of gods, have also emerged. [1-45-39]

Shlok 40: Owing to the dispute regarding the possession of that ambrosia, oh, Rama, then 
there chanced a rampant ethnic havoc, and then the sons of Aditi have havocked the 
sons of Diti. [1-45-40]

Shlok 41: All the asura-s and demons have come to one side against sura-s, and there occurred 
a very gruesome war which was perplexing to all the triad of universe viz., ethereal, 
real and surreal spheres. [1-45-41]

Shlok 42: When everything is wading into annihilation then that omnicompetent Vishnu swiftly 
impounded Amrita, the Divine Elixir, by assuming his illusory power of Mohini. [1-45-42]

[Commentary] Mohini literally means 'that which bewitches' and usually described as a feminine 
or neutral power of Vishnu, personified by a bewitching divine female. Thus Vishnu 
is said to have assumed a physique of such a voluptuous and bewitching seductress, 
marvellously limbed, and mantled in see-thru clothing, and thus maddened everybody 
around her. Then she started to serve Amrita/Ambrosia among the gods and demons 
on making them to sit on either side of her way. Even the age-old Brihaspati, the 
Jupiter, sitting in god's row, has come under her charm and started gazing her from 
top to toe, pruriently. When Brihaspati saw the feet of that damsel, they appeared 
as male person's feet. He further looked at those two feet and beholding them as
shrii caraNa, 'Reverential Divine Feet of Vishnu,' with which he covered 
the three spheres, Brihaspati's illusion is shattered and he venerated those feet, 
recognising this as Vishnu's Maya, illusory power.

Shlok 43: Whoever confronted that Eternal and Supreme Person, namely Vishnu, in that war, 
then Vishnu whose blaze is threefold as manifest in the sun, fire and lightning, 
has pulverised him. [1-45-43]

Shlok 44: In this horrendous war between the progeny of Diti, namely demons, and the progeny 
of Aditi, namely gods, the sons of Aditi being gods, have altogether massacred the 
demonic sons of Diti. [1-45-44]

Shlok 45: "On eliminating the demonic sons of Diti and on acquiring kingdom of heaven, that 
eliminator of enemy cities, namely Indra, happily ruled the worlds that are inclusive 
of sages and caarana-s." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Vishaala 
city and its emergence. [1-45-45]





[Commentary] Legend/puraaNa: Once, when Indra was riding his elephant Iravata, Sage 
Duurvasa came towards him and offered a garland, respecting Indra as the administrator of the universe. 
Indra decorated that garland on the head of his elephant and that elephant removed it and trampled. 
By this Duurvasa, who is an angry sage by himself, is angered and curses Indra to fall from the grace 
and all his luxurious paraphernalia be submerged in ocean. Accordingly, Indra looses everything and 
becomes destitute, and he then approaches Vishnu. Vishnu reprimands Indra for ridiculing elderly sages 
like Duurvasa and then plans to churn the ocean to retrieve all the lost treasures. Thus, the legend 
and the churning are going on for ages.

[Commentary] From the kundalini / power of yoga point of view the churning of ocean 
is continually going on in everyone's body. The body is the ocean and at its abyss, the triangle in 
the perineal or sacral plexus is the base of Mt. Mandara. The churning rod is the spinal cord in the 
rod like backbone and the churning strings are the ida, pingala namely, 
the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The churners are the air elements of vital forces on either 
side. This total system is held upright by Vishnu because He is naaraayaNa, nara 
+ aayaNa 'one who conducts humans, say created beings, into being and lead them away, again into 
His own self...' When kundalini power is incited the first results are 
always negative like, haalaaha, 'the lethal poison...' and all all-ruinous 
ills befall on us. If this negativity is surrendered to someone who can handle it effortlessly, like 
Shiva, then the positivity results like Amrita/Ambrosia. Even if this elixir 
of life is readily available, there will be still better lures, lusts, and longings like Mohini and 
if enchanted by those instantaneous quirks, which are yet another kind of negativity, we will be lost 
completely, like the demons. Hence 'churn the correct way...' is the postulate of yoga.







SARGA 46
------------------------------

[Text] Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have 
			killed her sons in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, 
			being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, with view to destroy 
			that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the 
			procedure of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into 
			seven fragments, which later become saptamarudgaNa-s, The Seven Wind-gods.

Shlok 1: "Oh, Rama, Lady Diti was highly anguished for those sons that are killed 
			and said this to her husband, Sage Kashyapa, the son of Sage Maareechi." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-46-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, god, I am bereaved of my sons who are killed by your great mighty 
			sons, the sons of your second wife Aditi, as such I wish to bear a son, 
			who is achievable by sustained penance, for he shall be the exterminator 
			of Indra. [1-46-2]

Shlok 3: 'Such a bereaved mother as I am, I wish to undertake asceticism for 
			a son who shall become an exterminator of Indra, and who shall be the 
			ruler of worlds. As such, it will be apt of you to permit me for asceticism, 
			and further it will be apt of you to accord me pregnancy with such a 
			son.' Thus Diti spoke to her husband Kaashyapa. [1-46-3]

[Commentary] A sage's wife requires permission of her husband if she wishes to undertake 
			an individual asceticism, because she will be receiving her own share 
			of merit from her sage-husband's penances and practises, as he is her 
			life-mate.

Shlok 4: On hearing her request the great resplendent sage Kaashyapa, the son 
			of Sage Mareechi, replied Diti, who is deeply mournful. [1-46-4]

Shlok 5: " 'So be it... oh, ascetically wealthy lady, you be blest, if you abide 
			by the propriety of the practises of asceticism, then you will be delivering 
			a son who can become an exterminator of Indra in war. [1-46-5]

Shlok 6: 'If you can complete a thousand years of asceticism punctiliously, 
			by my grace you can deliver a son who can be a husbander of three worlds.' 
			Thus Sage Kaashyapa advised his wife Diti. [1-46-6]

[Commentary] In some other versions the word trailokyahantaaram is carried 
			forward from earlier verses of Diti, into the speech of Sage Kaashyapa 
			also. Some have it as trailokyabhartaaram 'a husbander of 
			three worlds...' Diti may have desired for a 'killer.' But Kashyapa, 
			as a father of both gods and demons, cannot term the issuing son as 
			an exterminator of three worlds, because the three worlds are in vogue 
			at Kaashyapa's grace. Some attach this adjective to Indra but not to 
			the forthcoming son of Diti.

Shlok 7: Saying thus that great resplendent sage patted her, and then on his 
			touching her she is consecrated, and then that sage Kaashyapa departed 
			for his ascetic practises, saying 'be blest.' [1-46-7]

Shlok 8: On the exit of Sage Kaashyapa, oh, best one among men Rama, highly 
			elated Diti reached the sacred place called Kushaplava, on which the 
			present City of Vishala is now standing, and practised a highly rigorous 
			asceticism. [1-46-8]

Shlok 9: While she is truly practising asceticism, oh, the best among men Rama, 
			that Thousand-eyed god Indra has indeed rendered services with his abundant 
			and surpassing veracities to her, who is none other than his maternal-aunt. 
			[1-46-9]

Shlok 10: The Thousand-eyed god Indra made available fire, firewood, water, the 
			sacred Kusha grass, fruits and like that tubers also, and whatever other 
			items she required in her ascetic practise. [1-46-10]

Shlok 11: All the time Indra indeed served Diti by massaging her body, and other 
			means of removing her bodily strain resulting from her arduous practises. 
			[1-46-11]

Shlok 12: Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, when ten years are less to complete 
			the thousand years span of her ascetics, Diti is highly rejoiced as 
			her ambition is going to fructify in just ten more years, and then she 
			spoke to the Thousand-eyed god, Indra. [1-46-12]

Shlok 13: Oh, best one among the valiant ones, Indra, to me who am practising 
			asceticism ten years are remaining to complete, then you can see your 
			brother, you be safe. [1-46-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, son Indra, whom I am bringing up for your reason, I will bring 
			him up as a victory-enthusiast, and oh, son, Indra, along with him conquering 
			the three worlds you can enjoy them, without febrility from your enemies.



Oh, son Indra, whom I am now bringing up, will be enthusiastic in 
			conquering you, but somehow I will manage him by telling that you are 
			after all his brother, and no harm shall be done to you, and oh, son 
			Indra, if you join him you will get rid of your febrility, caused by 
			his emergence, and then you two can conquer all the three worlds. [1-46-14]

Shlok 15: Oh, best one among gods, Indra, on my prayer your high-souled father 
			Sage Kaashyapa bestowed this boon on me for a son, which materialises 
			at the end of thousand years, and only ten more years are to slip by. 
			[1-46-15]

Shlok 16: When Diti was saying thus, the noontime sun was reigning high that 
			lady is stolen over by sleep keeping her feet headward. [1-46-16]

[Commentary] This 'keeping feet headward' is variously inferred. While sitting she leaned on 
her knees and her braid touched feet, thus she became impious. She slept with her 
head neither towards east nor to south. The ancient cots in India used to have head-side 
and feet-side finishing. Then she placed head at feet-side and feet at head-side. 
Even if a cot is not there, though slept on ground, the head shall be positioned 
eastward or southward, but not to north or west. Finally, she slept at noontime, 
and for a person under a vow noontime sleep is prohibitive.

Hence her meticulousness is defeated.

Shlok 17: On observing her who has become impious by placing her head at feet-side 
			and braid falling on feet, Indra is gladdened and laughed at her failed 
			asceticism. [1-46-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, Rama, being a highly courageous one, Indra the destroyer of enemy 
			fastnesses, entered the body of Diti through her vaginal aperture and 
			rent her foetus asunder into seven fragments. [1-46-18]

Shlok 19: Oh, Rama, then that foetus wailed clamorously while being sliced with 
			Thunderbolt that has hundred cutting edges, and then Diti woke up. [1-46-19]

Shlok 20: 'Do not scream, do not scream...' thus Indra was coaxing the foetus, 
			and even though that foetus is screaming piteously the great resplendent 
			Indra has gone on fragmenting it. [1-46-20]

Shlok 21: 'Unkillable, unkillable is my foetus...' thus Diti raved in that way, 
			and then Indra fell out of the womb honouring his stepmother's entreaty. 
			[1-46-21]

Shlok 22: Indra humbly folding his palms that are still handling his bloody Thunderbolt 
			spoke to Diti, 'oh, lady, you have become impious when your braid touched 
			your feet and when you have gone to sleep in midday, and you vow is 
			thwarted.' [1-46-22]

Shlok 23: "Thereby I gained a chance to eliminate him who can eliminate Indra 
			in a battle. Hence I fragmented your foetus into seven fragments, and 
			it will be apt of you to pardon me for that act of mine." So said 
			Indra to lady Diti. Thus, Sage Vishvamitra continued narration about 
			City of Vishaala. [1-46-23]



SARGA 47
------------------------------

[Text] The legend of Seven-Maruts, the Seven-Wind gods, and the legend of the kings of Vishaala 
are narrated to Rama and Lakshmana, while Vishvamitra is narrating the legend of Vishaala. At the request 
of Diti, Indra blesses the seven segments of her foetus to become saptamarudgaNa-s, 
Seven Wind gods, and the place where the legend of Indra-Diti has happened, that province 
later became the City of Vishaala.

Shlok 1: "Diti was highly anguished when her foetus is rendered into sevenfold, and spoke these 
appeasing words to the indomitable Thousand-eyed Indra." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
City Vishala. [1-47-1]

Shlok 2: 'Oh, Indra, the eliminator of demon Bala, this foetus of mine is sliced into seven 
segments owing to my own misdeed, oh, ruler of gods, Indra, indeed there is no iniquity of yours in 
this matter.' Thus Diti started speaking to Indra. [1-47-2]

Shlok 3: Though a reversal has happened against my thinking in the matter of my pregnancy, 
let these seven segments become your seven Wind-gods, the rulers of seven ethereal-places, under your 
ruler-ship. [1-47-3]

[Commentary] According to mythology there are seven ethereal places in cosmos on which the galaxies 
and planets are dependent. According to Vishnu Puraana: aavahapravahavashcaiva 
samvahaH ca udvaH ca tathaa | vihaakhyaH praivaahaH paraavaheti kramaat || 
gaganaH sparshanaH vaayuranilaH ca tathaaparaH | praaNaH praaNeshvaraH jiiva iti 
ete saptamaarutaaH || They are: aavaha the air called by this name 
will be pervading in clouds, thunderbolts, rain, meteors; pravaha air in 
solar orbit; samhava in lunar orbit; udvaha in galaxies; vivaha 
in planetary spheres; parivaha in the Seven-Sages sphere; varaavaha 
in north polar regions. These are otherwise called by names gagana, sparshana, 
vaayu, anila, praaNa, praaNeshvara, jiiva. Each of the Marut god has a batch 
of seven Marut-s, thus they are forty-nine entities, in total.

Shlok 4: Oh, son Indra, let these seven sons of mine become the seven presiding deities of 
Cosmic Air Divisions and let them move in heaven with heavenly forms. [1-47-4]

Shlok 5: One from the seven may permeate Brahma's abode, likewise another may permeate the 
heaven of Indra, and even the third one, let him become a greatly celebrated and reputed as Divine Wind, 
and he may circulate in entire universe. [1-47-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: 'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, let four of my sons permeate four directions according to 
time and at your command, let safety betide you, and let them be renowned verily by the name given by 
you as 'Marut,' because you have coaxed the crying fragments of foetus saying, 'maa ruda, maa ruda, 
'do not cry, do not cry...' Thus Diti said to Indra. [1-47-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On hearing her words, the Thousand-eyed destroyer of enemy's citadels and a demon named 
Bala, namely Indra, spoke this word to Diti, humbly adjoining his palms. [1-47-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9- 10a: " 'All this will happen as you have said, undoubtedly, and your offspring, the Maaruta-s, 
would be pervading in the forms of gods, you be safe.' Thus Indra assured Diti. Those two, the stepmother 
Diti and the stepson Indra, on arriving at a decision in that ascetic forest, departed to heaven fulfilling 
their purposes. Thus we heard the legend." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-47-8b, 9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, this province is that one which was once presided over by Indra, 
and where he rendered services to that accomplished one in her asceticism, namely lady Diti. [1-47-10b, 
11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: To king Ikshvaku of Vishaala, oh, tigerly-man Rama, a highly righteous son was born 
through queen Alambusa, and he was renowned as Vishaala. There is a city in this place constructed by 
him and known by his own name, Vishaala. [1-47-11b, 12]

[Commentary] These Ikshvaku-s of Vishaala are not the Ikshvaku-s of Ayodhya, i.e., of Solar Dynasty. 
The Bhaagavata Puraana says separately in its seventh canto about this dynasty of Ikshvaku-s of Vishaala.

Shlok 13: "Oh, Rama, Vishaala's son is the great-mighty Hemachandra, and Hemachandra's son is highly 
renowned as Suchandra.. [1-47-13]

Shlok 14: "The son of Suchandra became famous as Dhuumraashva, and oh, Rama, Dhuumraashva derived 
his son named Srinjaya. [1-47-14]

Shlok 15: The fortunate and valorous son of Srinjaya is Sahadeva, and the son of Sahadeva is the 
most righteous Kushaashva. [1-47-15]

Shlok 16: The highly resplendent and dauntless Somadatta is the son of Kushaashva and Somadatta's 
son is highly reputed as Kakutstha. [1-47-16]

Shlok 17: Presently that Kakutstha's son named Sumati, who is a great-resplendent one, an unconquerable 
one, and a highly celebrated one is dwelling in this city. [1-47-17]

[Commentary] These two Ikshvaku and Kakutstha are of Vishaala dynasty. They are not to be confounded 
with the grandparents of Rama.

Shlok 18: By the grace of Ikshvaku, the successive kings of Vishaala have longevity, intrepidity, 
well-off in generosity, and they were great-souled ones. [1-47-18]

Shlok 19: "Today we may gladly go to sleep here for a night, and oh, best one among men, and it 
will be apt of you to see Janaka, the King of Mithila tomorrow morning." Thus Sage Vishvamitra spoke 
to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-47-19]

Shlok 20: The best one among best men, a widely reputed and the highly resplendent king of Vishaala, 
namely Sumati, having heard that Vishvamitra has arrived at the precincts of the city, came to him for 
a warm welcome. [1-47-20]

Shlok 21: King Sumati arrived along with his mentors and family members, offered an excellent veneration 
to Vishvamitra, and then spoke to the sage with adjoined palms enquiring about his well being. [1-47-21]

Shlok 22: "To which province you have visited that happens to be mine, thereby I could get an audience 
of yours without stirring myself from my country, hence none will be more fortunate than me." So said 
king Sumati to Vishvamitra. [1-47-22]



SARGA 48
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra narrates the legend of Ahalya to Rama and Lakshmana when 
			they arrive at the precincts of Mithila, bidding farewell to the King 
			of Vishaala. Indra is infatuated with Ahalya desires a union with her, 
			for which she complies. However, Gautama catching them unawares curses 
			both Indra and Ahalya.

Shlok 1: When those two, Vishvamitra and Sumati, have met one another there at that place, 
king Sumati raised the topic of Rama and Lakshmana, after exchanging greetings and 
enquiring about the well-being of the great-saint Vishvamitra. [1-48-1]

Shlok 2: "These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious 
elephants and arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine 
bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching 
that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness 
in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals 
have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have 
come here, and whose scions are they? [1-48-2, 3, 4]

[Commentary] The word deva can easily be said as a 'god' but, this is said to be Vishnu, 
as implied at 4-43-56 of Kishkindha 'There the Cosmic-Souled God, namely Vishnu...' 
etc. Now the enquirer himself is no less than a godly king, hence he identified 
the boys as non-terrestrial. No fatherly person accepts youngsters to footslog miles 
and miles, and so far this is an unobserved and an uncared for aspect by other sages 
and saints, because all of those sages and saints are footsloggers. This may be 
one of the reasons for Dasharatha in refusing to send Rama with Vishvamitra. However, 
King Sumati, being a glorious and fatherly king brought up this topic. Vishvamitra 
is giving a 'rehearsal' for these brothers for their real forest trekking later 
in the legend. Further, if a divine deed is to be done and a benefit therefrom is 
to be acquired, one has to footslog. Now Rama is going to perform a divine feat 
called 'bending the bow of Shiva' and thereby winning the hand of an unusual princess 
Seetha, in marriage. Hence, he footslogged this much distance for siitaakalyaaNaartham, 
lokakalyaaNaartham Seetha's marriage, which is for the 'universal 
goodness.'

Shlok 5: "These two best ones among men are identical to one another by their bodily proportion, 
facial-language, and by bodily gestures, and with their presence they refurbish 
this province like the Moon and Sun brightening the firmament. In truth, I would 
like to know for what reason these valiant ones who are wielding best weapons have 
arrived here travelling on an arduous path." Thus, king Sumati asked Vishvamitra. 
[1-48-5, 6]

[Commentary] The word facial-language translated for ingita may be an extended expression 
for the  body language. This word is for the voice muted facial expressions, given 
through smiles, eyebrows, lip movement etc. A person could be analysed by these 
very expressions as we presently call this as face reading. This is what Sugreeva 
says when sending Hanuma to Rama and Lakshmana for the first time, 'because you 
are an expert in reading faces, know them by their facial expressions...'

Shlok 7a: On hearing those words of King Sumati, Vishvamitra informed him about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, also about the elimination 
of demons, as it has happened. [1-48-7a, 7b]

Shlok 7c- 8: King Sumati is highly astonished to hear the words of Vishvamitra about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana, and treating them to have come as the most prominent and 
honour-worthy guests that king started to honour those two great-mighty sons of 
Dasharatha customarily. [1-48-7c, 8]

Shlok 9: On getting high honours from King Sumati, Raghava-s stayed there along with Vishvamitra 
and with the community of sages for one night, and then they all have moved on to 
Mithila. [1-48-9]

Shlok 10: On seeing Janaka's auspicious city Mithila, all of the saints who are accompanying 
Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana, extolled it saying, "Splendid! Splendid!" and 
admired it highly. [1-48-10]

[Commentary] Ayodhya is not fortunate enough to receive any worship from the onlookers, but it 
will be admired for its fortification. However, Mithila is a venerable city, because 
by itself it is a temple town and the Vedic-rituals etc., will be going on forever. 
It is a blessed place as it has Shiva's Bow, for which bow ritual worship is be 
ongoing from time immemorial.

Shlok 11: On seeing a hermitage in the fringes of Mithila, that appeared to be age-old, but 
now uninhabited, yet pleasing, Rama asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-48-11]

Shlok 12: "This is semblable to a hermitage but sages seem to have discarded it. Oh, venerable 
sage, whose is this hermitage previously, I wish to listen of it." Thus, Rama asked 
Vishvamitra. [1-48-12]

Shlok 12: On hearing that sentence spoken by Raghava, the expert in sententiousness, a great 
resplendent sage and eminent-saint Vishvamitra replied him in this way. [1-48-13]

Shlok 14: What a pleasure! You may listen as I narrate, Raghava, whose hermitage is this 
factually, and which great soul has resentfully cursed this. [1-48-14]

[Commentary] The pleasure expressed by Vishvamitra is for the arrival of time, for the event 
of Rama's grace, in releasing Ahalya from her cursed state.

Shlok 15: Oh, the best one among men Rama, this hermitage with a heavenly glisten, and highly 
hallowed even by gods, once belonged to the great-souled sage Gautama. [1-48-15]

Shlok 16: In this hermitage, oh, prince Rama, once that highly renowned Sage Gautama sat 
tight in asceticism for numerous cycle of years along with his wife Ahalya. [1-48-16]

Shlok 17: On knowing the meantime of Gautama's availability at hermitage, Indra, the husband 
of Shaci Devi and the Thousand-eyed god wearing the guise of sage Gautama and becoming 
such a sage, approached Ahalya and said this to her. [1-48-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, finely limbed lady, indulgers do not watch out for the time to conceive, 
as such oh, slender-waisted one, I desire copulation with you. [1-48-18]

[Commentary] Vividly: Oh, Ahalya, Brahma crafted you so well that all your limbs are symmetrically 
conjoined, so who in the universe will not yearn to have intercourse with you... 
and on seeing your slender waist and thickset hips I wish to copulate with you now 
itself... and let there be no fear of safe period or unsafe period for I do not 
wish to have any progeny of mine from you...

Shlok 19: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, though knowing him as the Thousand-eyed Indra in 
the guise of her husband Gautama, she is inclined to have intercourse ill-advisedly, 
only to satisfy the impassion of the King of Gods. [1-48-19]

[Commentary] Her thinking is: This is none but Indra in the guise of my husband, for my husband 
never asks me like this nor he violates times... I heard that Indra is seeking me 
for a long time... and when King of Gods expresses such a desire, it cannot be refused... 
let him have it

Shlok 20- 21a: She felt fulfilled in her heart of hearts and then she said this to that best god 
Indra, 'I am gratified in complying with your wish, oh, best of gods, get going 
oh, lord, from here quickly, oh, ruler of gods, always safeguard yourself and me 
from Sage Gautama.' Thus, Ahalya said to Indra. [1-48-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: Indra on his part smilingly said this word to Ahalya, 'oh, well-hipped lady, I 
am quite delighted, here I go as I have came.' [1-48-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Oh, Rama, Indra then came out of the cottage flustering hurriedly after copulating 
with her with an uncertainty about the arrival of Sage Gautama. [1-48-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24- 25a: Indra looked at Gautama..the one who is great saint, inaccessible to gods and demons, full of ascetic power,
purified with holy water, bright like fire, holding Samidha-s and kusha grass in hands,
and eminent Sage entering into the hermitage. [1-48-23b, 24, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26: On seeing the sage the lord of gods Indra is scared and became dreary-faced. Then 
the well-behaved Gautama furiously spoke these words on seeing the ill-behaved Thousand-eyed 
Indra who is donning the guise of a saint. [1-48-25b, 26]

Shlok 27: 'Oh, dirty-minded Indra, taking hold of my form you have effectuated this unacceptable 
deed, whereby you shall become infecund.' Thus, Gautama cursed Indra. [1-48-27]

Shlok 28: When that great-souled sage Gautama spoke that way with rancour, the testicles 
of the cursed Thousand-eyed Indra fell down onto ground at that very moment. [1-48-28]

Shlok 29: On cursing Indra thus the sage cursed even his wife saying, 'you shall tarry here 
for many thousands of years to come without food and consuming air alone, and unseen 
by all beings you shall live on in this hermitage while contritely recumbent in 
dust.' [1-48-29, 30]

Shlok 31: When that unassailable son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, arrives at this squalid 
forest, for it will be henceforth rendered so along with you, then you will be purified. 
[1-48-31]

Shlok 32: 'On your welcoming Rama, oh, ill-behaved woman, you will be divested of your greed 
and craze in which you lingered so far, and then you will assume your own body and 
then you can be in my proximity, rejoicingly.' Thus, Sage Gautama cursed his wife 
Ahalya. [1-48-32]

Shlok 33: "On cursing immodest Ahalya thus, that great-resplendent Sage Gautama shed this 
hermitage which was once adored by celestials like siddha-sand caarana-s, and that 
great-ascetic Gautama practised his asceticism on the pleasant peaks of Himalayas." 
Thus, Vishvamitra continued his narration about the legend of Ahalya. [1-48-33]



SARGA 49
------------------------------

[Text] Ahalya is redeemed from her curse when Rama enters their hermitage. 
			Vishvamitra while continuing the narration of the legend of Ahalya asks 
			Rama to enter her hermitage where Ahalya is living unseen by anybody. 
			When once Rama steps into that hermitage she manifests herself from 
			her accursed invisible state. She emerges with her divine form and accords 
			guestship to Rama and Lakshmana. Sage Gautama also arrives at this juncture 
			to accept his depurated wife Ahalya.

Shlok 1: The emasculated Indra then with panicked eyes spoke to gods, siddha-s, gandharva-s, 
and carana-s, keeping Fire-god as their helms-god. [1-49-1]

Shlok 2: I have Indeed incited fury in that noble-souled Sage Gautama by effectuating 
hindrance in his asceticism, but I have accomplished a task of gods. [1-49-2]

[Commentary] Indra is a position assigned to some high-souled being on acquiring considerable 
merit. He functions as a CEO of the universe, maintaining seasons, rains, thunders, 
thunderbolts, crops, earthquakes, and every aspect of nature, whether they are good 
or bad for us. If any Vedic-ritual were performed, this Indra would be too happy, 
as he and his deputies like Rain-god, Fire-god, Air-god, et al., will receive many 
oblations from that ritual. But if it is tapas 'the practise of asceticism, 
penance, or ascesis' by single sage, Indra will be highly perturbed. Usually sages 
will be practising this ascesis for attainment of higher abodes of Brahma, Vishnu, 
or Shiva. Some practise this to overthrow present Indra and try ascending to his 
position, or to attain immortality and thereby rout out Indra, as with the case 
of Ravana. When that practise is about to materialise, Indra sends his agents, like 
voluptuous celestial beauties, namely the apsara-s, to infatuate those sages with 
their beauty. Once the sage's concentration fails, his practise becomes futile. 
Thus, Indra retains his present position. Here, though Sage Gautama did not practise 
his ascesis for Indra's post, Indra had to hinder it in his own apprehension, and 
when the fury of Gautama is incited, Gautama's practise also failed and he had to 
redo his ascesis until he overcomes his passions. Thus, this 'causing hindrance' 
is a divine-act as proclaimed by Indra to other gods. In doing such 'divine-acts' 
Indra will also be maligned, for which the higher gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, 
or other higher beings will come to his rescue.

Shlok 3: By Gautama's anger I am rendered testicle-less and his wife Ahalya is also rejected 
by the sage, and thus by his releasing a severe curse his propriety for ascesis 
is dwindled, therefore his ascesis is pre-empted by me. [1-49-3]

Shlok 4: 'Therefore, oh, all gods with the assemblages of sages and caarana-s, it will 
be apt of you to make me virile again, as I have acted for the benefit of gods.' 
Thus Indra spoke to all gods. [1-49-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing the words of the officiator for Hundred-Vedic-rituals, namely Indra, 
all of the gods and other assemblages of celestials, together with the groups of 
Marut-gods came to the godly manes keeping the Fire-god in van, and appealed. [1-49-5]

Shlok 6: 'This ram is with testicles and Indra is indeed rendered testicle-less. Taking 
the testicles of this ram they may be given to Indra quickly.' Thus Fire-god started 
his appeal to manes. [1-49-6]

Shlok 7: 'This ram that is being offered to you shall now be gelded to give its testes 
to Indra, and though this ram is deprived of its organ it will be complete and it 
endows complete satisfaction to you. To those humans who hereafter offer testes-less 
rams in sacrifices for the purpose of your gratification, you shall truly offer 
them plentiful and unmitigated benefits.' Thus Agni, the Fire-god spoke to manes. 
[1-49-7]

[Commentary] The 'manes' are the deified souls of dead ancestors. It is customary to offer 
un-castrated or unmutilated animals in sacrifices to please gods or departed souls. 
Presently some humans have offered such an un-castrated ram to manes and the manes 
are about to enjoy it. But the gods have come and Agni, the Fire-god, is asking 
them to part with such an offering, for the sake of Indra. And when the manes were 
hesitating to go against the existing rules of ritual, then Agni, the Fire-god, 
is amending those rules and he is saying a boon-like proclamation. 'From now, the 
manes can enjoy even a castrated ram, if offered by humans on earth, and in turn 
the manes shall afford plentiful benefits of undiminished value to those offerers, 
namely humans...'

Shlok 8: On hearing the words of Agni, the Fire-god, the manes-gods who gathered to collect 
their share of offering have extricated that ram's testes, which is not yet sacrificed 
but tethered to a sacrificial post, and offered them to the Thousand-eyed Indra. 
[1-49-8]

Shlok 9: Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, from then onwards the manes-gods who come to collect their 
share are enjoying even the goats, even if they do not have testes, to endow benefits 
thereof to those that offer those goats, and to join the testes of goats to Indra. 
[1-49-9]

[Commentary] If rams with testes are offered the manes discard the testes of those rams and enjoy 
the rest of it. Even if a goat is offered they enjoy it, considering it as homogenous 
to a ram. In either way, the offerer is blessed with benefits and Indra with testes.

Shlok 10: Oh, Raghava, owing to the efficacy of the great-souled Gautama and his ascesis, 
from then onwards Indra has became one with the testes of a goat. [1-49-10]

Shlok 11: "Therefore, oh, great-resplendent Rama, enter the hermitage of Gautama whose deeds 
are pietistic, and atone Ahalya who is highly fortunate and who is in the compose 
of a divinity." Thus Vishvamitra spoke to Rama. [1-49-11]

Shlok 12: On hearing Vishvamitra's words Rama entered the hermitage along with Lakshmana and 
keeping Vishvamitra afore. [1-49-12]

Shlok 13-15: She whose splendour is brightened by her ascesis, at whom it is impossible to raise 
an eye for a stare either for gods, or for demons, or for the worldly beings on 
coming close to her, whom the Creator has contrived with careful contemplation as 
an angelic and a completely phantasmal entity, who is like the befogged and beclouded 
moonshine of a full moon as she is hitherto enshrouded by the dried up leaves and 
dust, who is like an unwatchable sunshine mirrored in and glowing from the midst 
of water, for she is hitherto in the midst of denounce, and whose limbs are like 
the tongues of a flaring fire around which fumes are cloaking, as she is hitherto 
practising an utmost ascesis subsisting on air alone, which ascesis alone made her 
like a flaring Ritual Fir, and Rama has seen such a highly glorious Ahalya. [1-49-13, 
14, 15]

Shlok 16: Ahalya is indeed indiscernible to all the three worlds by the very word of Gautama 
until the manifestation of Rama. [1-49-16a, b]

Shlok 16c- 17a: On reaching the end of curse she came into the view of Raghava-s, and they too gladly 
touched her feet in reverence. [1-49-16c, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: Reminiscing Gautama's words Ahalya received those two, and self-consciously offered 
water for feet and hand washing, and like that she also offered guestship customarily 
and dutifully, and Rama of Kakutstha on his part acquiesced her hospitality. [1-49-18]

Shlok 19: There chanced an abundant floral fall form firmament to the drumbeats of god's drums, 
and the celestials like gandharva-s, apsara-s revelled in a splendid festivity that 
is superb. [1-49-19]

Shlok 20: Gods have collectively reverenced her, whose limbs are depurated by the asset of 
her ascesis which is performed as a devotee of Gautama remaining in his directives, 
saying 'Gracious! Goodness!' [1-49-20]

Shlok 21: Even that great-resplendent Gautama is heartened when he reunited with Ahalya after 
a long, long a time, and that sage customarily reverenced Rama for actualising his 
solemn utterance, and that great-ascetic Gautama continued his ascesis together 
with Ahalya. [1-49-21]

Shlok 22: Even Rama on receiving a conventionally high veneration in the manifestness of that 
great-saint Gautama himself, then moved ahead to Mithila. [1-49-22]

[Commentary] The legend of Ahalya is viewed from many viewpoints, because it is unclear whether 
she is a humanly lady or a divine entity, or a tract of land.

[Commentary] The atheists, rather materialists, in their translation of Ramayana take this Ahalya, 
according to their viewpoint, as an uncultivable tract of land by saying that is
a halya un, ploughed...land' Thereby Rama rendered 
it as a cultivable land in the course of his socio-economic reforms. There are many 
other instances in relating these mythical accounts of Ramayana to the earthly plane. 
Another instance is lavaNaasurasamhaara elimination 
of Saline Demon...' and Rama's elimination of this demon is taken as treatment of 
saline oceanic water as potable waters...'

[Commentary] When the mythology is touched upon, it says that Ahalya is lying there as a stone 
and by the touch of Rama's foot she regained her divinely human form. This is not 
evident in Valmiki Ramayana. The idea of petrifaction of Ahalya is brought in from
PadmaPuraana which says: saa tataH tasya raamasya paadasparshanaat

of the feet of that great souled Rama, she was manifest as a divine damsel, getting 
rid of her stone-shape...' Further, there will be an exchange of words between Indra 
and Brahma in Uttara Kanda of Ramayana, and there this episode of Ahalya recurs. 
At that place Brahma defines hala as - distorted shape...' and a halya 
is one with an impeccable beauty...' Besides the above, Indra will be usually addressed 
as sahasraakSha - thousand eyed one...' and behind this legend, there 
is another legend, saying that Gautama's curse to Indra is: since you delighted 
with Divine Ahalya, who is crafted by Brahma, in carnal pleasures, let there be 
thousand carnally vaginal apertures on your body...' Then that Indra is agitated 
for such an appearance, pleads for mercy. Then, the curse is amended saying 'instead 
of vaginal apertures, the apertures on your body will look like eyes...' thus Indra 
became sahasraakSha.

[Commentary] F. Max Muller records in his History of Sanskrit Literature' the commentary of Kumaarila 
Bhatt, yet another ancient commentator on Ramayana. "In the same manner, if it is 
said the Indra was the seducer of Ahalya. This does not imply that the God Indra 
committed such a crime, but Indra means the Sun and Ahalya the night, from [the 
words] ahaH the 'day' and lil the 'night'; and as the night is 
seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning, there is Indra called the paramour 
of Ahalya."

[Text] Rama arrives at Mithila along with Lakshmana led on by Vishvamitra. On hearing that Vishvamitra has 
arrived at their city Mithila, King Janaka proceeds to him welcomingly. On seeing Rama and Lakshmana 
near at Vishvamitra, Janaka inquisitively asks Vishvamitra about these two princes. Vishvamitra announces 
them as the sons of Dasharatha and informs about the adventurous deeds the boys have undertaken.

Shlok 1: Rama then travelled along with Lakshmana towards northeast direction keeping Vishvamitra afore and neared 
the hall of Vedic ritual of Janaka in Mithila kingdom. [1-50-1]

[Commentary] The northeast is an auspicious direction, and even today it is held high for any ritual or in the architecture. 
This direction is presided over by iishaana The God.

Shlok 2: Rama who is with Lakshmana spoke to the tigerly saint Vishvamitra, " the Vedic-ritual of noble-souled 
Janaka is excellent, indeed with bountifully garnered paraphernalia of the ritual. [1-50-2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, highly fortunate sage, this place abounds with many thousands of Brahmans who are experts in Vedic 
practises and who seem to be the dwellers of numerous provinces, and also discernable are the cottages 
of sages rife with hundreds of carts full with their ceremonial chattels, as such oh, Brahman, a campsite 
may be decided for us too, as I discern every inch is inhabited." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-3, 
4]

Shlok 5: On hearing the words of Rama that great-saint Vishvamitra arranged a camp at an unfrequented place that 
has refreshing water. [1-50-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: On hearing that Vishvamitra has arrived in Mithila, then the best king Janaka instantly forged ahead 
towards Vishvamitra, keeping his unreprovable priest Shataananda afore of the team, in deference to 
Vishvamitra. [1-50-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: Even the Ritvik-s, the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, of the great souled king Janaka arrived 
with post-haste taking holy waters, and they have ritualistically offered that sanctified water to Vishvamitra. 
[1-50-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: On receiving that veneration from the great souled Janaka, Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of 
the king Janaka, as well about the unhindered proceedings of that Vedic-ritual. [1-50-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Then Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of saints, mentors, clerics, as befitting to their order, 
and joined the company of all of the sages as a happy-souled sage. [1-50-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: The king Janaka adjoining his palms then spoke to that eminent-sage Vishvamitra, "oh, reverend sage, 
please be seated on this high seat, along with these eminent saints in their respective seats." Thus 
Janaka spoke to Vishvamitra [1-50-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On hearing the words of Janaka that great-sage Vishvamitra took his seat, and king Janaka also took 
seat along with his royal priest Shataananda, and the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, namely Ritvik-s, 
and along with his ministers. [1-50-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: On beholding all of them seated all about in their respective seats as demanded by procedure king Janaka 
then spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Today my Vedic ritual is enriched with your advent, whereby I deem that gods have fructified the ritual. 
Let the ritual be like that. I deem that I have obtained the fruit of the ritual just on seeing godlike 
you here today. [1-50-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Oh, Brahman, at which Vedic-ritual hall you have arrived along with so many sages that happens to be 
mine, whereby, oh, eminent saint, I feel that I am honoured and hallowed. [1-50-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Oh, Brahma-sage, the scholarly Ritvik-s conducting my Vedic-ritual are saying that only twelve more 
days are remaining to complete the observation of ritual-pledge, and then oh, Kaushika, it will be apt 
of you to see the gods who arrive at the conclusion of this Vedic-ritual expecting their due in the 
ritual." So said king Janaka to Vishvamitra. [1-50-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: On speaking to that tigerly sage Vishvamitra in this way, the king again asked the sage pointedly and 
inquisitively with adjoined palms and with a gladdened face. [1-50-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19: These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and arrogant 
lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, 
and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals 
and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals have chanced 
on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have come here, and whose scions are 
they? [1-50-17b, 18, 19]

[Commentary] These foots are the same as king Sumati's dialogue at 1-48-2, 3, 4 including anvaya , parsing.

Shlok 20- 21: Oh, great-saint, whose sons are these two valiant youngsters who are brandishing best weapons? They 
are embellishing this province as the Sun and Moon doeth the sky. Each to each they are clonal by postural-language, 
by facial-language and by body language. They appear valorous but boyish in their appearance, as their 
curls are still jet-black like crow-wings. Thus, whether they are immature by age though mature by their 
valour or so, I wish to listen about them in actuality. [1-50-20, 21]

[Commentary] Import of verses is the same as at 1-48-5, 6, with a little difference in anvaya , parsing.

Shlok 22: On hearing the words of great-souled Janaka, Vishvamitra whose anima is immeasurable, has announced 
that those two as the sons of king Dasharatha. [1-50-22]

Shlok 23: The highly resplendent great-saint Vishvamitra has informed the high souled Janaka about the coming 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, their stopping over there and elimination 
of demons at that place, their indefatigable travel along with him, beholding City of Vishaala, seeing 
Ahalya, her reuniting with Sage Gautama, likewise their coming hitherward to gain a grasp of great bow 
of Shiva. On informing all these incidents to Janaka as well as to Shataananda, who incidentally is 
the son of Ahalya, sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-50-23, 24, 25]



SARGA 51
------------------------------

[Text] Enquiring about his father Gautama's reuniting with his mother Ahalya, Sage Shataananda 
relates the legend of Vishvamitra. Shataananda greets Rama for his adherence to 
the rectitude of Vishvamitra, which Vishvamitra gained through a series of self-important 
exploits, when he was a great king at one time. Shataananda finds worth in informing 
the biography of Vishvamitra to Rama, because too much of overbearing of kings, 
as has been done by Vishvamitra, will be unbecoming for kings.

Shlok 1: On hearing that sentence of that intellectual sage Vishvamitra, the highly refulgent 
and the great ascetic Shataananda is overjoyed, and Sage Shataananda, the eldest 
son of Sage Gautama, and whose radiance is brightened by his own ascesis is highly 
amazed just on seeing Rama. [1-51-1, 2]

Shlok 3: On raptly observing those two princes who are sitting comfortably with their heads 
bending down submissively, then Shataananda spoke to the eminent sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-51-3]

Shlok 4: Oh, tigerly saint Vishvamitra, you have revealed my glorious mother Ahalya who 
meted out a marathon ascesis to the princes - Really! [1-51-4]

Shlok 5: And the highly resplendent and celebrated mother of mine worshipped Rama, who is 
worthy of worship by every corporeal being, with forest produce, is it so! [1-51-5]

Shlok 6: Oh, great-resplendent Vishvamitra, you have narrated to Rama about the maltreatment 
of my mother by the Providence as has happened anciently, isn't it![1-51-6]

Shlok 7: Oh, the best sage Kaushika, you be safe, my mother is reunited with my father on 
beholding and giving hospitality to Rama - Really! [1-51-7]

Shlok 8: Oh, Kaushika, my father came to my mother's place from Himalayas! Has the great 
resplendent father of mine worshipped Rama because the redemption of my mother is 
per the kindness of Rama! Has this great-souled Rama reverenced that great resplendent 
father of mine by according a redemption, ahalyaa-daana, 
the endowment of Ahalya to her husband. [1-51-8]

Shlok 9: "Oh, Kaushika, on his arrival at my mother's place whether this reverential Rama 
reverenced my father with a pacified heart without becoming contumelious!" Thus 
sage Shataananda exclaimed at the marvel occurred through Rama. [1-51-9]

Shlok 10: On hearing that sentence of his, that great-saint and sentence-precisian Sage Vishvamitra, 
replied the sentence-precisionist Sage Shataananda. [1-51-10]

Shlok 11: "I have done whatever good is to be done and nothing is left undone, and the wife 
of the sage, namely Ahalya, is reunited with her husband sage Gautama, as with Renuka 
who was reunited with sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu." So said Vishvamitra. 
[1-51-11]

[Commentary] Renuka is the mother of Parashu Rama, another human incarnation of Vishnu as a Brahmin 
to struggle with the erring Kshatriya kings of an earlier era. Renuka's husband 
is Sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu or also called as Bhaargava and on certain 
occasion, Jamadagni, orders his son Parashu Rama to behead her, i.e., Renuka, Parashu 
Rama's own mother and Parashu Rama unhesitatingly carries out his father's orders. 
Thus, Parashu Rama is called Bhaargava Rama, with an axe as his unsurpassed weapon. 
This Parashu Rama confronts Rama of Ramayana after Seetha's marriage.

Shlok 12: On hearing those words of that highly intellectual Vishvamitra, high refulgent sage 
Shataananda spoke these words to Rama. [1-51-12]

Shlok 13: Hail to thee! Oh, best one among men Rama, your arrival is a godsend, not only 
to Mithila but to entire humanity, and oh, Raghava, as an undefeatable great-sage 
Vishvamitra spearheads you, so shall your mission be undefeatable, thus hail to 
thee! [1-51-13]

[Commentary] This statement of Sage Shataananda shall remind us the utterances of Vishvamitra 
in Dasharatha's court at 1-19-14: aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam... 'I 
know this great soul Rama, the virtue valiant, even Vashishta and also these saints 
who are here...' So also, Shataananda being the son of Ahalya and Gautama perceived 
who this Rama is. Further, when such and such a sage spearheads Rama, Rama ought 
to know something about the background of his steersman, namely Vishvamitra, basing 
on which Rama can learn his own lessons. As such, next few chapters are catered 
to the legend of Vishvamitra through Shataananda.

Shlok 14: This highly resplendent Vishvamitra's exploits are unimaginable. He attained the 
highest order of Brahma-sage by his ascesis, thus illimitable is his ascetic resplendence, 
and you have to know him as an ultimate course, not only to you alone, but also 
to one and all. [1-51-14]

[Commentary] If the text 'you already know him...' is adopted there will be nothing left to Shataananda 
to say more. Hence, the meaning is said on taking vedmya 'you should know 
some more...' would be better. Because Vishvamitra is a paramahitasandhaayaka 
'a do-gooder for universal peace' as indicated by his name itself, vishva 
'of universe...' mitra 'friend, 'friend of universe...'

Shlok 15: None other than you is fortunate enough on earth, oh, Rama, as you are in the custodial 
care of Vishvamitra, the scion of Kushika, who has practised supreme ascesis. [1-51-15]

Shlok 16: What is the prowess of the great-souled Vishvamitra, and what the quintessence 
of his legend may be heard from me while I narrate it. [1-51-16]

Shlok 17: This probity-souled Vishvamitra, being a proficient in rectitude, a perfectionist 
in kingcraft, a proponent of people's welfare, more so a persecutor of enemies, 
was there as a king for a long time. [1-51-17]

Shlok 18: There was a king named Kusha, a brainchild of Prjaapati, and Kusha's son was the 
powerful and verily righteous Kushanaabha. [1-51-18]

Shlok 19: One who is highly renowned by the name Gaadhi was the son of Kushanaabha, and Gaadhi's 
son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra. [1-51-19]

Shlok 20: Vishvamitra ruled the earth, and this great-resplendent king ruled the kingdom 
for many thousands of years. [1-51-20]

Shlok 21: At one time the great-resplendent king Vishvamitra went round the earth marshalling 
a unit of akshauhini army. [1-51-21]

[Commentary] The army unit called akshauhini consists of 21,870 elephants, as many chariots, 
65,610 cavalry, and 1,09,350 foot soldiers.

Shlok 22- 23- 24- 2125- 26- 27- 28a: Moving sequentially about the provinces, cities, rivers likewise mountains, king 
Vishvamitra arrived at the threshold of a hermitage which is with numerous flowered 
trees and climbers, overspread with very many herds of animals, adored by the celestials 
like siddha-s and caarana-s, frequented and embellished with gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
and kinnara-s, spread out with equable deer, adored by flights of birds, compacted 
with the assemblages of Brahma-sages, and also with the assemblages of godly-sages 
who are fully accomplished in their ascesis, where the personal resplendence of 
each of the great-souled sage is similar to each of the Ritual-fire available in 
each of the Ritual Fire Altar before which he is sitting, and which hermitage is 
bustling with the activity of great-souled sages who are comparable to Brahma, among 
whom some subsist on water alone, and some on air alone, likewise some more on dry 
leaves, while some on fruits, tubers, and with such of those sages and also with 
particular sages like Vaalakhilyaa-s, also with others like Vaikhaanasa-s, who are 
all self-controlled, who have overcame their peccabilites, who have overpowered 
their senses that hermitage is occupied, and while everyone of the inmates is engaged 
in meditations and oblations into Ritual-fire, and with such sages and their activity 
whole of the perimeter of that hermitage is brightened and rendered splendent, and 
king Vishvamitra arrived at such a magnificent hermitage of Sage Vashishta. [1-51-22, 
23, 24, 2125, 26, 27, 28a]

Shlok 28: "And this best one among vanquishers and the great-stalwart Vishvamitra has then 
seen the hermitage of Vashishta which is like the worldly Universe of Brahma." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-51-28]



SARGA 52
------------------------------

[Text] Vashishta offers hospitality to Vishvamitra and his armies. Even though the King Vishvamitra is 
	disinclined to pressurise a hermit with such a burdensome affair of hospitality to hosts, Vashishta 
	entreats the king to accept. Vishvamitra had to oblige the same. Vashishta summons his do-all Divine 
	Sacred Cow, Shabala, also known as Kaamadhenu, requests her to generate heaps of tasteful foodstuffs 
	for a royal banquet as well as for military rations.

Shlok 1: On seeing at that best sage among best meditators Sage Vashishta, the great-mighty and valorous Vishvamitra 
is highly rejoiced and obediently made an obeisance to the sage. [1-52-1]

Shlok 2: The great-souled Vashishta spoke, "you are welcome," and that godly sage has indeed shown a high seat 
to Vishvamitra. [1-52-2]

Shlok 3: The eminent saint Vashishta then customarily offered fruits and tuber to the courageous Vishvamitra 
who by now has assumed a seat. [1-52-3]

Shlok 4: On receiving that deference from Vashishta, then that unsurpassed king Vishvamitra asked after the well-being 
of the ascesis, Fire-rituals and disciples and their progress in that hermitage, and that great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra has also asked after the well being of flora and fauna of the hermitage, and Vashishta reported 
to the matchless king about the all round well-being of every activity. [1-52-4, 5]

Shlok 6: Vashishta the supreme one among meditators, a great-ascetic, and the brainchild of Brahma has then asked 
Vishvamitra who is sitting at ease. [1-52-6]

Shlok 7: I hope that you are fine! And oh, righteous king, hope that you are ruling people righteously with 
kingly righteousness to their contentment. [1-52-7]

[Commentary] The kingly righteousness is one component among the four primary concerns of the kingcraft as said at:
nyaayena aarjanam arthasya vardhanam paalanam tathaa | satpaatre pratipattiH ca raajavR^ittam 
caturvidham ||  'monies are to be earned righteously, they are to be enriched righteously, 
and safeguarded righteously, and they are to be endowed to righteous deeds or persons, for welfare of 
the state, righteously...'

Shlok 8: I hope your servants are looked after well, hope all of them are abiding by the rulership, oh, vanquisher 
of adversaries, I hope that you have surely vanquished all of your adversaries. [1-52-8]

Shlok 9: "For you are an impeccable one and an emery-inflamer, oh, tigerly-man, I hope that your forces, exchequer 
and confederates are fine, and all is well with your sons and grandsons." Thus Vashishta asked the well-being 
of Vishvamitra. [1-52-9]

Shlok 10: The great-resplendent king Vishvamitra respectfully replied Sage Vashishta saying, 'everything 
is fine.' [1-52-10]

Shlok 11: Both of those celebrities of conscientious then exchanged pleasantries for a long time with their rejoice 
heightening and gladdening one another. [1-52-11]

Shlok 12: Then at the end of discussions, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, that godly Sage Vashishta smilingly 
spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-52-12]

Shlok 13: I wish to offer guestship befitting to your status, oh, great-forceful king Vishvamitra, to a matchless 
one like you and to this military force of yours, kindly accept it from me. [1-52-13]

Shlok 14: 'You may kindly accept all these hospitalities offered by me, oh king, for you are an important guest 
you ought to be reverenced effortfully.' So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-52-14]

[Commentary] 'It is quiet meaningless on the part of this sage, subsisting on wild fruits and tubers, to offer a 
royal banquet or rations to military and feed to horses and elephants' - is the thinking of King Vishvamitra. 
For that, the sage is saying that a king is to be reverenced 'effortfully...' But, Vishvamitra is reluctantly 
evading the so-called hospitality for 'royals' and 'armies' from a poor hermit.

Shlok 15: When sage Vashishta said in this way, that highly-intellectual king Vishvamitra said to him, 'hospitality 
is deemed to have been offered to me with your reverential words, it is enough and nothing more is necessary.' 
[1-52-15]

Shlok 16: I am entertained with whatever item that obtains in your hermitage, say fruits, tubers and water 
for feet-wash and to wet mouth. Why those petty items, I regaled just by seeing you, a godly sage like. 
Oh, highly noetic sage, by yourself you are a sage worthy to be reverenced by one and all, such as you 
are you alone have reverenced me. Now I wish to take leave, please accept my obeisance to you, and please 
look upon us with a friendlily regard. [1-52-16, 17]

[Commentary] The reverential salutation namas te astu is discussed in the endnote.

Shlok 18: Even if the king was speaking in this way obliquely to him, that virtue-souled and magnanimous sage 
Vashishta entreated the king repeatedly. [1-52-18]

Shlok 19: Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra then replied the eminent saint Vashishta, "Agreed! As it pleases the godly 
sage. So be it!" [1-52-19]

Shlok 20: When Vishvamitra said that way then Vashishta, the best one among meditators, and one whose blemishes 
are laved is gladdened, and started calling his speckled cow, namely Shabala, yclept Kaamadhenu. [1-52-20]

Shlok 21: Come on, oh, Shabala! Come quickly and listen to my words. I prepared to accord hospitality with 
a highly delectable royal banquet to this kingly sage together with all his forces. You arrange it for 
me. [1-52-21]

Shlok 22: Oh, Kaamadhenu, the Divine Cow, the Milker of All-Desires, for my sake you shower whatsoever foodstuff 
is savoured by whosoever according to one's own piquancy from each of the six savour, that too plentifully. 
[1-52-22]

[Commentary] The six tastes that shall comprise an Indian meal are: 1] caustic, 2] acidic, 3] sweetish, 4] salty, 
5] un-sweetish [bitter,] and 6] alkaline.

Shlok 23: " 'Oh, Shabala, you create heaps of savourily foodstuffs comprised of masticable items like crunchy 
foods, drinkable items like soft-drinks, tasteable items like honey-like viscous dishes, squeezable 
items like pulpy fruits, and be quick.' " So said Sage Vashishta to that Sacred Cow, Kaamadhenu, and 
Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-52-23]





[Commentary] The reverential greeting namaste is from the root nam 'bend down a little...' before 
upper echelons and the word namas is usually translated a 'salutation by bending a little...' 
and namas kaara is the act of doing so. This word namaH= na aham is 'not me...'
te astu but 'you, it shall be...' rather, 'I have lost my 'I-ness' before you as I am humbling 
myself to your high knowledge or, high seat, or elder age...' and let your 'your-ness' prevail over 
me, for I am somewhat an inferior being before you...' is the latent meaning.

[Commentary] This is either vocalised or coupled with the gesture of adjoining palms, and that mudra 'gesture...' 
is called an~jali or as a Latinian friend of ours has provided its Latin counterpart as:

[Commentary] The infinitive is iungere manus ante pectus 'to join hands in front of your chest...' or merely
iungere manus 'to join hands...' We can say iungimus manus ante pectus 'we join or 
fold our hands in front of us...' iungo manus ante pectus 'I fold my hands...' iungite 
manus ante pectus 'fold your hands in front of you...' This last sentence is the - you, plural 
- is in command form. Again, you may leave out ante pectus for succinctness.

[Commentary] And if the word iun with a half 'n' nasal is matched with Sanskrit a~n in an~jali 
and the word ngo is matched with Sanskrit ~nja as the English 'g' is most often used 
for Sanskrit 'ja' by Max Muller et al., the two an~jali of Sanskrit and iungo Latin 
have same pronunciation and portent in prayer or traditional salutation.



SARGA 53
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra tries to gain Kaamadhenu, but Sage Vashishta persistently refuses Vishvamitra's bargains 
and barters. 'When an ordinary cow alone is held sacred and it is an un-marketable commodity, how then 
can Shabala, a milker of any wish, be given away or bartered for other riches...' is the argument of 
Vashishta. Yet, Vishvamitra goes on his bidding, but in vain.

Shlok 1: "Oh, enemy-chastener Rama, when the Divine Cow Shabala is spoken in this way by Sage Vashishta, then 
that milker bestowed each and every fancy, fancied by each and every fancier, according to one's own 
fancy." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shabala or Kaamadhenu, as a part of the legend 
of Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-53-1]

Shlok 2: Shabala bestowed dishes of sugar cane and honey, and flakes of all sorts, like cornflakes, rice-flakes, 
also best arracks and liquors in best wineglasses, further, the drinks and foodstuffs that are very 
diverse and verily apposite to royalties and army-men. [1-53-2]

Shlok 3: There emerged mountainous stacks of steamy foodstuffs, palatable side-dishes and desserts of rice 
etc., also the dumplings of cooked pulses, like that the cascades of curds and the other milk products 
like butter, ghee, cheese etc. Thousands of silver dishes and hollowware fully replete with daintily 
soft drinks, like that full with sugar-candy preparations, and with preparations that comprise all the 
six tastes have come up together with delectable foodstuffs made out of treacly dumplings of cane sugar. 
[1-53-3, 4]

Shlok 5: Oh, Rama, all of the men in the forces of Vishvamitra, who are already rejoiced and regaled by the 
regular feasts accorded by their king Vishvamitra, are now comparatively well gladdened when feasted 
by Sage Vashishta, in which they rejoiced and regaled, for a good measure. [1-53-5]

Shlok 6: Partaking that feast together with the best royal ladies of palace chambers, and with the court-scholars 
and the court-priests even the king Vishvamitra, who by his nature is a kingly sage, became exultant 
and energetic. [1-53-6]

Shlok 7: When honoured along with his advisers, ministers and attendants by way of receiving a royal banquet, 
king Vishvamitra then in high admiration spoke this to Vashishta. [1-53-7]

Shlok 8: You showed me a generous hospitality whereby I am esteemed by an estimable sage like you, oh, expert 
in sententiousness, now I wish to say for myself to which you may please listen. [1-53-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: 'Oh, godly sage, this Shabala may be given to me for a barter of a lakh, a hundred thousand, cows. 
Indeed this do-all cow is a treasure, and the kings are the gatherers of treasures. Therefore bestow 
this cow to me. As rule this cow also belongs to me.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Vashishta. [1-53-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: When Vishvamitra addressed him in that way, the reverential sage Vashishta, who is a virtue-souled 
eminent saint, on his part replied the king in this way. [1-53-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: I cannot afford Shabala, neither by the barter of a hundred thousand cows, nor by hundreds of millions 
of cows, nor by lots and lots of silver, either. [1-53-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: Abandoning her from my proximity is unmeet for her, oh, enemy-subjugator, you cannot even subjugate 
me terroristically and try to wean this cow away from me, as Shabala is everlastingly and inseparably 
mine, as with the everlasting and inseparable respectability of a self-respectful person. [1-53-12b, 
13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: This cow makes the journey of my life possible. Oblations to gods or manes, enkindling of Ritual-fire, 
religious sacrifices, homa-s, the sacred rituals conducted as
darshapaurNamaasi, all are dependent on her. [1-53-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: This cow is the bedrock for everything in its entirety, and regarding diverse and numerous indoctrinations, 
and even for add-on syllabics like svaahaa, vaSaT, they are all dependent 
on this cow, there is no doubt about it. [1-53-14b 15a]

[Commentary] When the Fire-Ritual, or homa is conducted each pouring of fluid oblation or each dropping 
of solid oblation into Fire-Altar is associated with Vedic-hymns addressing the particular receiver-deity, 
annexed with syllabics like: svaahaa, svaahaakaaraaH at the end of each chant like indraaya 
svaahaa, indraaya idam na mama... varuNaaya svaahaa, varuNaaya idam na mama... 'to Indra this is 
scarified, this is for Indra, not mine... to Rain-god this is sacrificed, this is for Rain-god, not 
mine...' So also the vaSaT is annexed to the hymns addressed to manes. To learn Veda-s one 
shall be eligible to perform a Fire-ritual, and if Fire-ritual is performed, some basic Vedic hymns 
are to be learnt, and all this is a cyclic affair, requiring much paraphernalia. This cow supplies everything 
at wish, without a hassle, either to the teacher or to the taught.

Shlok 15b- 16a: "In truth, this cow is everything to me and ever-gratifier, that way by so many reasons, oh, king, 
I cannot afford Shabala to you or to anyone." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-53-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Though Vashishta spoke thus Vishvamitra being an expert in sententiousness then spoke this sentence 
compellingly and argumentatively. [1-53-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18b: I bestow upon you fourteen thousand elephants adorned with golden girdles, golden necklets and golden 
goads. [1-53-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: I will grant you eight hundred golden chariots whichever can be yoked on with four whitely-white 
horses trimmed up with the sets of tintinnabulating bells. [1-53-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b: I grant you, oh, superbly vowed sage, eleven thousand fleetly galloping horses of high pedigree born 
in best countries of best horse breeding. [1-53-19b, c]

Shlok 20: I award ten million diversely coloured and differently divisionalized cows, whichever of them will 
be came of age as milker, thereby, let this do-all cow Shabala be given to me. [1-53-20]

Shlok 21: "Or, oh, eminent Brahman, if you yearn either for gems or gold, I gift that much of everything as 
much as you can yearn, let Shabala be given to me." Thus Vishvamitra entreated again. [1-53-21]

Shlok 22: When the shrewd king Vishvamitra spoke to the reverential sage Vashishta, that sage has clearly said, 
'whatever it is oh, king, I do not surrender Shabala, the cow.' [1-53-22]

Shlok 23: Really this alone is my gemmy cow, thus I do not require your jewels or gems... truly, this alone 
is my treasure, thus I do not require your gilded chariots, horses or elephants... really, this alone 
is my everything, thus I need nothing from you... and actually, this alone is my alter-ego, thus you 
cannot separate me from myself. [1-53-23]

Shlok 24: This alone is my darsha-puurNamaasa rituals, and like that this alone 
is all my Vedic-rituals with worthwhile donations and oh, king, this essentially is of service in diverse 
activities of mine. [1-53-24]

Shlok 25: " Oh, king, all of my activities are instated in this cow, then wherefore a lot of palavering a bargain 
or barter? I do not give away this milker any wish." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra, and thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of the legend of Sacred Cow. [1-53-25]

[Commentary] If cow is held sacred in India it is held precious all over the world. Whatever is given by a cow, from 
its milk to cow-dung, it is put to use, even for medicinal purposes, which is evident from insulin and 
smallpox vaccines. Regarding go mahaatmyam 'sacredness of cow' Bheeshma speaks at length about 
the sacredness of cow to Yudhishtar, in Anushaasanika Parva of Maha Bharata.

[Commentary] Here, on hinting in an indirect way about go maahaatmyam 'the sacredness of the cow...' and 
its un-marketability, Sage Vashishta paused his negation, hoping that Vishvamitra will realise, as he 
is also well-versed in scriptures.



SARGA 54
------------------------------

[Text] The seizure of Kaamadhenu, the Sacred Cow, causes anxiety in her and she urges Vashishta 
to counteract the atrocity of Vishvamitra. Agreeing to her, the sage asks the Cow 
to create a force that can subdue the forces of Vishvamitra. Accordingly, that Cow 
generates newer forces and a war ensues.

Shlok 1: "When Sage Vashishta did not yield Kaamadhenu, the milker of any desire, oh, Rama, 
then Vishvamitra started to seize it." Sage Shataananda continued the narration 
of the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-54-1]

Shlok 2: While the determined king Vishvamitra dragged her away from Vashishta, oh, Rama, 
Shabala is saddened and tearfully mulled over stung by the anguish of her secession 
from the sage. [1-54-2]

Shlok 3: A pitiable and highly anguished one, such as I am. I am being dragged away by 
the servants of the king. Has this great souled Sage Vashishta abandoned me, or 
what? [1-54-3]

Shlok 4: 'Or, did I do any misdeed towards that great sage of sacred soul whereby he is 
leaving me off. I have always been reverent and a cherished cow to that priest 
and am I no errant.' That cow eulogised in this manner. [1-54-4]

Shlok 5: On thinking thus and suspiring repeatedly, oh, enemy-subjugator, Rama, then she 
that Sacred Cow hastily rushed with the speed a gust and went to that highly energetic 
Vashishta on utterly shoving off hundreds of attendants of the king who are roping 
her, and then she straight went to the base of the feet of the great-souled Vashishta. 
[1-54-5, 6]

Shlok 7: She that moaning and groaning Shabala staying before the Sage Vashishta spoke this 
bellowing like a thunderous cloud. [1-54-7]

Shlok 8: 'Oh, Son of Brahma, why I am discarded by you, whereby oh, god, the king's attendants 
are weaning me away from your proximity.' So Shabala urged Vashishta. [1-54-8]

Shlok 9: When he is spoken thus, then that Brahma-sage spoke this sentence to worrisome 
Shabala, whose heart is worrying with worry, as he would speak with his own sister 
in her worriment. [1-54-9]

Shlok 10: Neither I forswear you nor you fouled me, oh, Shabala, this king is forcibly 
weaning you away from me as he is beside himself with kingly arrogance. [1-54-10]

Shlok 11: 'My ability is not balanceable with his, isn't it. Above all, on his part he is 
a king now, and a king will be mighty, he is the lord of the land and a Kshatriya, 
and thus we have to be subservient to a Kshatriya, isn't it. [1-54-11]

Shlok 12: 'This akShauhiNi unit of army is plethoric, overcrowded 
with elephants, horses, and chariots, and overspread with flags and elephants, thereby 
he is mightier than me.' Thus Vashishta tried to pacify that Sacred-Cow. [1-54-12]

Shlok 13: She who is spoken that way by Vashishta, that sententious Sacred Cow, Shabala, 
in her turn obediently spoke this sentence to that Brahma-sage of un-balanceable 
resplendence. [1-54-13]

Shlok 14: 'Oh, Brahman, unstated is that the might of sovereignty as mightier than the might 
of sagacity. A sage is mightier than a sovereign. A sage's might is mightiest than 
the mightier sovereign, for a sage's might is angelic.' So Shabala started talking 
to the sage. [1-54-14]

[Commentary] This is the relevant stanza for the later time debates or essay competitions under 
the caption of 'pen vs. sword... which is mightier...' Here, though Vishvamitra 
is well aware that a sage's possession cannot be usurped, he resorted to the same. 
The Sacred Cow is telling the above with intolerance towards Vishvamitra's violation 
of the norms. saa api asahamaanaa kaamadohinii shaantyaa kShamayaa yuktam vashiShTam avocat 
-

[Commentary] What a king has got to do with a sage's wealth? A sage acquires it with his ascesis 
and it is not another king's kingdom to conquer.

- dk The scriptures, norms, ethics demand that a sagacious person 
shall not be robbed off his possession, which he acquires by his personal merit. 
But Vishvamitra's brain tilted this way because of his all-conquering avarice and 
he thought that this cow is also conquerable, and gods give such a mind only to 
see the greedy to fail and thus insulted of their might.

[Commentary] na tveva kadaacit svayam raajaa brahmaNasvaadadiita - bodhaayana suutra - atha

possession is not to be snatched away - bodhaayana suutraa-s; 'a poison 
if consumed kills one that consumes it... but the possession of a sagacious person, 
if tried for consumption, it consumes whole lot of the consumer's sons, grandsons 
and his clan itself, besides the consumer...for sage's possession in itself is a 
lethal poison...'

Shlok 15: Immutable is your power as you are mightier than great-mighty Vishvamitra and 
invincible is your dynamism. [1-54-15]

Shlok 16: 'Ordain me, oh, highly resplendent sage, who am replete with the power of your 
sagacity, and I will disprove the vanity, valour, and venture of that injudicious 
king for this injudicious seizure.' Thus Shabala implored the sage Vashishta. [1-54-16]

Shlok 17: Oh, Rama, when spoken by her thus, that highly glorious Vashishta said to Shabala, 
the do-all cow, 'create a power that can overpower the power of opponent.' Vashishta 
said so to Shabala.[1-54-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: On hearing his sentence, oh, Rama, that Sacred Cow Shabala then created Pahlava 
kings, sprang forth from her mooing 'hums', and hundreds of them annihilated the 
army of Vishvamitra in its entirety just while Vishvamitra is witnessing it. [1-54-18, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: King Vishvamitra was utterly infuriated and with wide-eyed anger he started to 
destroy those Pahlava-s with many a kind of his weaponry. [1-54-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: On seeing the subdual of hundreds of Pahlava-s by Vishvamitra, then the Sacred 
Cow again generated deadly Shaka-s hobnobbed with Yavana-s through her mooing 'hums'. 
[1-54-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] These Shaka-s and Yavana-s are the Shakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians 
of Max Muller. Some discussion about this is included in the endnote of Kishkindha, 
Ch. 43. Dharmaakuutam says: tadanu vashiShThaabhyanuj~naataa shabalaa nirmitapahlavaadi - nikR^iShTajaati 
- niShuuditam svam balam vishvaamitra - iti - dk These are viewed 
as deadly, lowly, ruffian class of warriors in Indian viewpoint and created out 
of thin air by this Sacred Cow.

Shlok 21b- 22a: Then the earth was pervaded with the Shaka-s associated with Yavana-s, who have 
effectuation and bravery in overcoming their enemy forces, and who are golden in 
bodily colour similar to the golden pistils of flowers which complexion is outlandish. 
[1-54- 21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b: Yavana-s and Shaka-s, who are wielding bowie knives and broad lances and who are 
clad in golden coloured dresses, and who looked like glowing fires have completely 
burnt down entire force of Vishvamitra. [1-54-22, 23a]

Shlok 23: "Then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra indeed released his missiles, by which 
Yavana-s, Kaambhoja-s, and the Barbara-s, are rendered helter-skelter." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra. [1-54-23b,c.]

[Commentary] The Barbara-s are said in this text whereas other mms contain it as "Pahlava-s'. 
Even on taking Barbara-s, they are an outlandish clan and the word 'Barbara' might 
have been the ancestor word of the present day 'Barbarian.'



SARGA 55
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra ruins Vashishta's hermitage on acquiring missiles at the grace of God Shiva by practising 
a paramount ascesis. When the forces generated by Wish-Milker Sacred Cow, namely Kaamadhenu, have eliminated 
Vishvamitra's army and his hundred sons, he felt indignant and pray Shiva for bestowal of unusual missiles. 
On getting them, he again comes to Sage Vashishta's hermitage and ruins it completely. Then extremely 
infuriated Sage Vashishta resorts to his Brahma-baton to confront Vishvamitra.

Shlok 1: Then on seeing the flurrying warriors earlier created by the Sacred Cow, Shabala, who are perplexed 
by the missiles of Vishvamitra, Vashishta started to motivate her, 'oh, wish-milker, generate more forces 
by your yogic capacity.' Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra 
to Rama. [1-55-1]

Shlok 2- 3: "From the 'hums' of her mooing Kaamboja-s similar to sunshine are born, from her udder Pahlava-s wielding 
weaponry are born, from the area of her privates Yavana-s, likewise from her rectal area Shaka-s, and 
from her hair-roots Mleccha-s, Haariitaa-s along with Kirataka-s are issued forth. [1-55-2, 3]

Shlok 4: At that very moment, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, Vishvamitra's army comprising foot-soldiers, elephants, 
chariots and horses is utterly slaughtered by the Yavana, Mleccha etc., forces generated by the Sacred 
Cow. [1-55-4]

Shlok 5: On seeing their army utterly slaughtered by the vital spirit of Vashishta, a band of hundred sons of 
Vishvamitra wielding divers weapons exasperatedly sprinted forth towards that supreme meditator among 
all meditators. But that great sage Vashishta completely burnt all of them down just by blasting 'hum' 
sounds. [1-55-5, 6]

Shlok 7: That sage with vital spirit, Vashishta, then in a wink rendered those sons of Vishvamitra, along with 
their horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers to ashes. [1-55-7]

Shlok 8: On seeing his sons and his forces are utterly ruined, that very highly glorious Vishvamitra was disgraced 
and beset by distress. [1-55-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: Like a tideless ocean his warfare did not tide him over, like a fangless serpent his hiss of warring 
could not fang any, like a wingless bird pitiable is his flightless plight of fightback, like a shineless 
sun in an eclipse, Vishvamitra plunged into a lustreless state of his own illustriousness, when his 
forces are ruined along with his sons. [1-55-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: When all his intrepidity and impetuosity are ruined an indolence bechanced upon him, and then on bidding 
one son for the kingdom, 'you rule the earth with the duties of kingcraft...' thus saying Vishvamitra 
took recourse to forests. [1-55-10b, 11]

Shlok 12: On going to the mountainsides of Himalayas, whereat it is adored by kinnaraa-s and uragaa-s, the nymphs 
and nymphean serpents, he that great practiser of ascesis, Vishvamitra, undertook an austere ascesis 
for the sake of beneficence of the Great God, Shiva. [1-55-12]

Shlok 13: After a long lost time, Shiva, the God of Gods whose flag bears the sign of Holy Bull, has shown himself 
to that great-saint Vishvamitra, for He is a ready boon-giver. [1-55-13]

Shlok 14: 'Oh, king, for which purpose you undertook this ascesis that you may tell me. What is it really intended 
by you and what boon you seek that be made known to me for I am the boon-giver.' Shiva said so to Vishvamitra. 
[1-55-14]

Shlok 15: Thus said by God Shiva to Vishvamitra of great ascesis, Vishvamitra on reverencing that Great God Shiva 
said this way. [1-55-15]

Shlok 16: Oh! Mahadeva, the Impeccable Great God... providing that you are gladdened by my ascetic devotion,
dhanurveda, the Holy Writ of Archery, with its complemental and supplemental 
Writs, and along with its summational Upanishad-s, together with its preternatural 
doctrines... they may kindly be bestowed upon me... [1-55-16]

Shlok 17- 18a: ' Oh, Exquisite God, whichever missile is there either with gods, or fiends, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, 
and demons, let it dawn upon me. For you alone are the God of Gods your blessings alone can fulfil my 
aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra entreated God Shiva. [1-55-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b: 'So be it!' On sanctifying Vishvamitra and his aspiration thus, the God of Gods, Shiva disappeared. 
[1-55-18b]

Shlok 19: Vishvamitra who is already a mightier Kshatriya, now on acquiring missiles from the God of Gods, Shiva, 
will he not come forth paired up with mightiest conceit, and then will not his conceitedness be plethoric 
like a plethoric ocean? [1-55-19]

Shlok 20: By vitality Vishvamitra is like an ocean with rough riptide on a Full Moon day, and oh, Rama, he deemed 
that sagaciously mighty sage Vashishta is now 'dead.' [1-55-20]

Shlok 21: Then on going to the threshold of Vashishta 's hermitage that king propelled his missiles, by the holocaust 
of which missiles that ascetic woodland is completely burnt down in its entirety. [1-55-21]

Shlok 22: On seeing the turbo-jetting missiles of Vishvamitra jetted by his sparkling intellect, hundreds of 
saints were frightened and they very speedily fled in hundreds of ways. [1-55-22]

Shlok 23: Whoever is the disciple of Vashishta and whichever is either animal or a bird, all are utterly frightened 
and thousands of them have hastily fled to numerous directions. [1-55-23]

Shlok 24: The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta's hermitage fell void, and in a wink it has become silent 
like a burial ground as every shrub, herb and tree is cindery, and every bird, animal and stock is an 
evacuee. [1-55-24]

Shlok 25: Although Vashishta shouted at them saying time and again, 'do not fear, do not fear... now I will dissipate 
that son of Gaadhi, Vishvamitra, like Sun demisting the mist,' all the inmates of hermitage have hastily 
fled. [1-55-25]

Shlok 26: On saying that way to the evacuees, Vashishta, the great-resplendent sage and a best one among best 
meditators rancorously said this word to Vishvamitra. [1-55-26]

Shlok 27: You senseless king, by which reason you have havocked this hermitage that is well nourished for a 
long time by me, for that reason you have become a reprehensible one, and thereby you will not survive 
any longer. [1-55-27]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'when I have sensibly nourished the trees, birds and animals or disciples, saints and sages, 
in indoctrinating them the true dharma 'righteous duty...' observable by each of the birthed 
being, what necessitated you to harm the harmless 'fly anywhere' birds, 'new to world' calves and 'take 
what you need' trees and animals... you should have confronted me headlong, instead... but you on seeing 
such a beatitude of this hermitage, you have become envious in your self-aggrandisement... and as said 
in an old saying like, 'a senseless reprehensible being, may it be a human, animal, bird, or a reptile 
is unfit to survive for long...' you are now transposable with such a senseless being by this act of 
yours, which you have undertaken with the notion of 'survival of the fittest...' thereby I will now 
show you who is fit enough to survive, an instructor or an intruder, in effacing your survival...'

Shlok 28: "On saying thus that extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta post-hastily up-heaved his baton, which is 
alike the fumeless Ultimate Fire of End Time, and the other baton of Yama, the Terminator, and affronted 
Vishvamitra." Thus, Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-55-28]



SARGA 56
------------------------------

[Text] Vashishta nullifies Vishvamitra's missiles just by his Brahma's baton. All missiles 
are defused when Vashishta consumed them. Vishvamitra launches the highest missile, 
namely Brahma-missile, which too is consumed by Vashishta, whereby the body of Vashishta 
becomes a Brahma missile and starts to emit radiation. Then, upon the prayer of 
gods and saints, Vashishta withdraws the effect of that missile. Vishvamitra on 
seeing this concludes that mere missiles are of no use and thus he embarks on a 
sublime ascesis for Brahma-hood.

Shlok 1: When Vashishta spoke in this way, the great-mighty Vishvamitra brandishing Fiery-missile 
challenged Vashishta saying, "withstand this, withstand this..." Thus, sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-56-1]

Shlok 2: That reverential sage Vashishta then upraising his Brahma-baton, which is like 
the other baton of the Terminator, spoke this sentence furiously. [1-56-2]

Shlok 3: I am staying here only, you meritless Kshatriya, you may clearly display whatever 
prowess you have, oh, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra, I will now ruin whatever vanity 
you or your missiles have. [1-56-3]

Shlok 4: "Where stands the force of belligerence when compared to the supreme force of 
sagacity, you abased Kshatriya, watch out for my strength of seraphic sagacity." 
So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-56-4]

Shlok 5: With his baton of Brahma Vashishta silenced that matchless and deadly Fiery-missile 
of Gaadhi's son, namely Vishvamitra, as a deluge of water silencing a rage of fire. 
[1-56-5]

Shlok 6: Vishvamitra, the son of Gaadhi then rancorously fusilladed the missiles regulated 
by gods like Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Paashupata, and even a missile which is projectile 
through grass blade called Ishiika. [1-56-6]

[Commentary] The accounts of these missiles are narrated in chapters 27, 28 of this canto Bala, 
where Vishvamitra accords these very missiles to Rama. Hence, their details are 
not reiterated here but just catalogued.

Shlok 7: Vishvamitra also launched missiles named Humane, Rager, Stupefier, Hypnotiser, 
Yawner, Intoxicator, also thus Humidifier, Weep-inducer. [1-56-7]

Shlok 8: He also launched the missiles called Drainer and Ripper, and the highly unconquerable 
Thunderbolt, even the lassos of Brahma, Time and Rain-gods. [1-56-8]

Shlok 9: Also missiles called Shiva, Monster, Punisher, Wrester and like that the Baffler, 
Bolter, Drier, Drencher are launched. [1-56-9]

Shlok 10: And he launched discs called the Discs of Virtue, Time and Vishnu and he also launched 
other missiles like the Blower, Stirrer and like that the missile with Horse-head. 
[1-56-10]

Shlok 11: A pair of powers are launched, namely Power of Vishnu and the Power of Rudra, like 
that the Impeller, Crowbar, and a great missile called Staggerer, and then he launched 
the lethal missile of the Time. [1-56-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, Vishvamitra on triggering off all these missiles 
then he launched the deadly Trident, Skull and Torque missiles on Vashishta, and 
whole thing has became a spectacular display of Vishvamitra's arsenal. [1-56-12, 
13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Brahma's son Vashishta defused all of those missiles just with his baton and when 
all of them are thus silenced, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra touched off Brahma's missile. 
[1-56-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: When Vishvamitra brandished and set up Brahma missile for launching, seeing it 
all the gods keeping the Fire-god at their vanguard, godly sages, reptiles along 
with gandharva-s are perplexed, and the triad of worlds itself is perturbed. [1-56-14b, 
15]

Shlok 16: Even that deleteriously destructive Brahma's missile is completely consumed with 
the seraphic resplendence of Brahma-baton of Sage Vashishta. [1-56-16]

Shlok 17: The appearance of that great-souled Vashishta became appallingly perplexing when 
he is finishing off that Brahma missile as if to surely petrify the Tri-world. [1-56-17]

Shlok 18: From all of the pits of hair of that great-souled Vashishta ramified are the raditional 
beams and those radiated shafts are rolling up with the fumes of radiation, so to 
speak. [1-56-18]

Shlok 19: The baton of Brahma gripped in his hand and upraised by Vashishta is highly glowing 
as if it is the fumeless inferno of Time, and as if it is the earthly baton of Yama, 
the Terminator. [1-56-19]

Shlok 20-21: 'The assemblages of saints then extolled the best meditator Vashishta saying, 'oh, 
Brahman, infallible is your prowess, but bear this combustion of missile by your 
own combustive power. Though Vishvamitra is a supreme ascetic he is forestalled 
by you and your seraphic power, but this power of yours is equally anguishing all 
the worlds. Hence, let the worlds survive shooing away their anguish caused by your 
prowess. Oh, Brahman, be gracious, for you are the best among the best meditators...' 
So said saints to Vashishta. [1-56-20, 21]

Shlok 22: When that great-resplendent Vashishta is spoken thus by saints and gods he composed 
himself, and then that estranged Vishvamitra spoke this to himself with heavy suspiration. 
[1-56-22]

Shlok 23: Fie upon the might of Kshatriya, mightier is the might of Brahman's resplendence, 
only with one baton of Brahma all of my missiles are defused. [1-56-23]

Shlok 24: " 'Therefore on analysing this matter, I with my heart and senses quietened will 
embark on a sublime ascesis which really will be the causative factor for according 
Brahma-Sage-hood.' So thought Vishvamitra..." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-56-24]

[Commentary] Firstly the difference between a
Brahmin and a Brahman 
may be differentiated, where a Brahmin is just by his birth in that caste and if 
he practises numerous ordeals he will attain Brahman-hood. Not all Brahmins are 
Brahmans and a real Brahman will not look back for his birth details.

[Commentary] Throughout 
this chapter Vashishta is called by Valmiki as japataam varaH, 
japataam shreSTaH and the like, only to remind us that Vashishta is an eminent 
meditator of Vedic hymns, all of which culminate into Gayatri hymn. Thus, Vashishta's 
only weapon is Gayatri hymn with which he subjugated all the arsenal of Vishvamitra. 
The fight between Vishvamitra and Vashishta is not just a fight between a sage and 
king, but between vidya - avidya; aatmavidya - anaatmavidya 
'enlightenment and un-enlightenment...' An enlightened one does not spring up at 
any trivial inconvenience but becomes a horrid being, if that antagonistic assail 
becomes intolerable for living beings. This is the real essence and nature of a 
true Brahman, whose arsenal is just a wooden baton 
and heartfelt Gayatri hymn.

[Commentary] For this Bhagavad Gita says at Ch. 18, verse 
42:

[Commentary] 'A Brahman's virtues, / Prince 
Born of his nature, are serenity / Self-mastery, religion, purity / Patience, uprightness, 
learning, and to know / The truth of things which be...' Sir Edwin Arnold.

[Commentary] Thus, 
Vashishta had never resorted to meaningless curses, menacing arsenal, mutinous retaliation 
but just swallowed the wrath of a wrathful king. This is brahmaNatva



SARGA 57
------------------------------

[Text] The legend of Trishanku is narrated to Rama, which forms a part of Vishvamitra's 
			legend. When Brahma blesses Vishvamitra to be a kingly-saint, rather 
			than a Brahman-saint, Vishvamitra continues his ascesis in southerly 
			parts of country. In the meantime, one king named Trishanku desired 
			to go to heaven with mortal body and approaches Vashishta who rejects 
			that very suggestion. Then that king approaches the sons of the same 
			Vashishta with the same idea.

Shlok 1- 2- 3a: "Oh, Raghava, on making that great-souled Vashishta an enemy, whenever Vishvamitra 
reminisced over his subdual by Vashishta, he is seethed at heart and heaved sighs 
repeatedly. Then on going to southern quarter with his prime queen, that great-ascetic 
Vishvamitra self-collectedly conducted a highly astounding ascesis subsisting only 
on fruits and tubers." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's 
legend. [1-57-1, 2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: Then Vishvamitra begot sons named Havispanda, Madhuspnada, Dhridhanetra and Mahaaratha, 
who conduct themselves in candour and chivalry. [1-57-3]

Shlok 4b- 5: At the close of one thousand years of ascesis Brahma, the Grandparent of all worlds, 
revealed Himself to Vishvamitra and spoke these words mellowly to ascetically wealthy 
Vishvamitra, 'oh, son of Kushika, Vishvamitra, you have won the worlds of kingly-sages 
by your ascesis.' [1-57-4b, 5]

Shlok 6- 7a: 'We indeed acquiesce you as a kingly-sage by your ascesis.' saying so that great 
resplendent Brahma, the Supreme Ruler of the Worlds, went away to his Abode of Brahma, 
while the gods in Brahma's convoy went to Indra's Heaven. [1-57-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On hearing that Vishvamitra is down-faced with disgrace, and while high anguish 
prevailed over him, he rancorously soliloquised this. [1-57-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: 'Even though I have practised a very high ascesis, the gods together with the 
observances of hermits are recognising me just as a 'kingly-sage.' Thereby I deem 
that there is no fruition to my ascesis.' Thus Vishvamitra thought. [8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, deciding in this way in his heart of hearts that self-willed 
Vishvamitra again undertook a supreme ascesis as he is a great-ascetic. [1-57-9]

Shlok 10b- 11a: In this meantime there is a veracious king named Trishanku, an enhancer of 
Ikshvaku dynasty, and one renowned for his self-conquest. [1-57-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: Oh, Raghava, an idea sprang up in the mind of Trishanku to perform a ritual 
by which he will go to heaven with his own body. Then he sincerely invited Vashishta 
and told him what his thinking is. [1-57-11b, 12]

Shlok 13- 14a: But the great-souled Vashishta said it as impossible. Thus repudiated Trishanku 
went to southerly direction in search of orchestrators for the purpose of realising 
that task, such a phantasmal ritual that enables him to go to heaven with his body, 
and that king has gone to the sons of Vashishta. [1-57-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: Trishanku has indeed gone to the place where the sons of Vashishta are protractedly 
expiating, and there he visited the hundred noble-souled sons of Vashishta, who 
are supremely self-luminescent and superbly self-refulgent by their ascesis. [1-57-14b, 
15]

Shlok 16- 17a: On reaching nigh of those noble-souled sons of the indoctrinator, namely Vashishta, 
Trishanku reverenced all of them sequentially according to their age, but with a 
little down- faced owing to abashment, and spoke to all of those great-souled ones 
making palm-fold in supplication. [1-57-16]

Shlok 17b- 18a: I have come as a shelter-seeker seeking the shelter of yours as you are the shelterers 
of the needy, you all be safe, as the great-souled Vashishta has repudiated me. 
[1-57-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: I am longing to perform an unusual ritual and it will be apt of you to give assent 
to it. Reverencing all of the sons of my mentor Vashishta I am proposing this to 
you. [1-57-18b, 19]

Shlok 19b- 20: With reverence I truckle before you all Brahmans who are abiding in ascesis. 
Such as you are I beg you to assiduously get a ritual performed through me, as to 
how I can get to heaven with my body. [1-57-19b, 20]

Shlok 21: Oh, ascetically wealthy Brahmans, as I am repudiated by Vashishta, I do not perceive 
another recourse excepting you, who are all the sons of mentor Vashishta. [1-57-21]

Shlok 22: " 'The Priest is the ultimate recourse for all of the kings in Ikshvaku dynasty, 
isn't it. Therefore, next to Vashishta you are all the next-best gods to me.' Thus 
Trishanku entreated the hundred sons of Sage Vashishta." Sage Shataananda thus continued 
narration. [1-57-22]



SARGA 58
------------------------------

[Text] Trishanku seeks shelter of Vishvamitra when the sons of Vashishta rebuffed him, and even cursed him 
to become a profaner. Narrating his sad tale and his idealistic idea of going to heaven with mortal 
body, Trishanku earnestly appeals to Vishvamitra.

Shlok 1: "On hearing the sentence of Trishanku, oh, Rama, the hundred sons of sage Vashishta infuriately said 
this to that king." Thus, sage Shataananda continued his narration to Rama and others. [1-58-1]

Shlok 2: 'You slow-witted king, your veracious mentor has denounced you. But transgressing him how do you approach 
another branch of the same tree of wisdom, when that very tree rejected you?' So the sons of Vashishta 
have started to denounce Trishanku. [1-58-2]

Shlok 3: 'The Royal Priest is the ultimate course for all of Ikshvaku-s, isn't it. It is impossible to transgress 
the word of advise of such a veracious Priest. [1-58-3]

Shlok 4: Vashishta is the most reverential sage and such a sage has already said it is impossible to conduct 
such a Vedic-ritual. Then, in which way we are capable to conduct such a Vedic-ritual? [1-58-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: 'Oh king of subjects, better get back to your own city again for you are childish. That godlike Vashishta 
alone is capable to orchestrate any ritual by any king in all the three worlds. Oh, king, how then we 
are capable to cause a disrepute to his reputation.' Thus, the sons of Vashishta refuted Trishanku. 
[1-58-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "On hearing that sentence of theirs which is highly faltering with words of fury that king further spoke 
this sentence to all of them." So Shataananda continued. [1-58-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: 'I am indeed rejected by the godlike Vashishta, likewise even by you, the sons of the same mentor, 
as such oh, ascetically wealthy scholars, in this state obloquy I will resort to another recourse, let 
safety betide you.' So Trishanku bade farewell to the sons of Vashishta, but... [1-58-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: But the sons of the sage Vashishta, on hearing that sentence of the king, that is inclusive of and 
leading to a calamitous situation, have become very highly infuriated and cursed saying, 'you shall 
get into a state of basely profaner.' That is the curse issued by the sons of Vashishta to Trishanku. 
[1-58-8b, 9a]

[Commentary] This expression caNDaal has its own impact. The nomenclature of caNDaal is not the 
present day 'untouchable' 'outcaste' or a 'pariah' etc., because he is also a member and an important 
functionary in Hindu system of castes. In Aranya Kanda Seetha admonishes Ravana with the same wording 
at 3-56-18. The analogy she uses there is to differentiate between functionaries like the Vedic-scholar 
and the caste-bound Profaner [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious rites or any esoteric 
knowledge... but socially designated as a Cremator] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, 
and between the Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar, or a true 
Brahmin may perhaps conduct a yaj~na but he is no authority to conduct antyakriya 
'funerals' till its end. At best, a priest's function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps 
until kapaalamoksha 'breakage of cranium...' and from then on it is the function of this
caNDaal to take care of the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since 
leaving half burnt corpse to vultures and wolves is sinning as well as for unsanitary situations. Thus, 
if a Vedic scholar conducts jaataadi kriyaaH 'rites from birth onwards...' as an initiator, 
then a caNDaal conducts antya, uttarakriyaaH 'rites of death afterwards...' as a 
terminator. This verbiage is to demark the relative values of functionaries, according to the maxim 
'a donkey is to bear and a dog is to bark...' and if their functions are reversed, reversed are our 
results.

Shlok 9b- 10a: On saying thus those great-souled sons of Vashishta withdrew to one's own hermitage and when that night 
elapsed into day then the king lapsed into a state of basely profaner. [1-58-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: He is now wearing blackish cloths which on yestereve were ochry silks, he is now a blackamoor who on 
yestereve was a gilt-royalty, his head-hair is shaggy which earlier was silkily soft, and his royal 
garlands which were richly fragrant are now funeral wreaths, and he is besmeared with crematory ashes 
which were regal emollients, and his royal jewellery is now rendered into iron adornments. [1-58-10b, 
11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On seeing him in the mien of a profaner, oh, Rama, all of his ministers and the subjects and his own 
retinue have deserted him and took to flight in masses. [1-58-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: Though that resolutely self-assured king seethed for one night and day for this mishap, then went to 
the ascetically prosperous Vishvamitra. [1-58-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: But on seeing at that mien of the king which is rendered to that of a precluded profaner from kingship 
and for officiating rituals etc., oh, Rama, sage Vishvamitra because sympathetic. [1-58-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] The preclusion of the king by way of his transfiguring into a profaner is not only from his kingship, 
by which he is debarred from officiating Vedic rituals etc., but also from his aihika-aamuSmika- 
bhogaaH 'earthly and heavenly enjoyments...' because a king is a godsend being.

Shlok 14b- 15a: The great-resplendent sage and highly generous Vishvamitra firstly said to that king who is in a terrible 
aspect 'let safety betide you,' and then spoke on this sentence to him. [1-58-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: 'What is the purpose of your visit, oh, great-mighty prince Trishanku, oh, brave lord of Ayodhya, 
you are accurst to the state of profaner.' [1-58-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then that king who is accurst to a state of profaner on listening that sentence, as a diligent sentence 
maker spoke this sentence with his palms adjoined to the sententious sage Vishvamitra. [1-58-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: I am spurned off by my mentor Vashishta and also like that by his sons. My aspiration remained unachievable, 
besides, this discrepancy has bechanced upon me. [1-58-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: 'Oh, gentle Vishvamitra, my aspiration is nothing but to go to heaven with my body. I have performed 
hundred rituals but I have not achieved the fruit.' Thus Trishanku started tell his sad tale.

Shlok 19b- 20a: And now if you doubt me to be a liar, I am no liar either. I spoke no lie heretofore, and even if 
I were to land into any predicament I do not speak lies anytime hereinafter. Oh, gentle sage, this I 
pledge you upon my virtue of Kshatriya-hood. [1-58-19, 20a]

[Commentary] A liar is hell-bound but not the other way as said yaj~no anR^ite na rakshati... 'a Vedic ritual 
would not save liars...'

Shlok 20b- 21a: I have propitiated gods with many kinds of Vedic-rituals. I have reigned over people conscientiously. 
And with my conduct and comport the high-souled savants are also pleased. [1-58-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: While I am a pursuant in probity I expect to avail myself of the fruition of this kind of Vedic-ritual. 
Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, but my mentors are not deriving complete contentment by my pursuit. Hence, 
they shove me off. [1-58-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: I deem destiny is the only ultimate, and manly efforts are meaningless, for destiny surmounts everything. 
Destiny is the ultimate course, isn't it? [1-58-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b: A highly anguished endeavourer, marred by destiny, a sincere requester, such as I am, it will be 
apt of you to accord, you be safe, your favour upon me. [1-58-23b, c]

Shlok 24: " 'In no alternate course I wish to course through and no alternative shelter is there for me. Hence, 
it will be apt of you, a god in man's mien, to countervail my destiny.' Thus Trishanku prayed for the 
grace of Vishvamitra..." So said Sage Shataananda to Rama and others continuing the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-58-24]



SARGA 59
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra undertakes Trishanku's Vedic ritual and sends disciples to invite all Vedic-scholars. Many 
sages have come except for Vashishta and his sons. Further, the sons of Vashishta have ridiculed this 
ritual of Vishvamitra and Trishanku. Vishvamitra gets irritated and hurls curses at the sons of Vashishta.

Shlok 1: "Vishvamitra, the son of Kushi, piteously spoke this mellowly sentence to king Trishanku who spoke thus, 
and who in reality attained a state of profaner." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-59-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s, you are welcome. I am aware that you are a highly righteous 
king. Oh, the best king, you need not be dismayed, for I accord you haven. [1-59-2]

Shlok 3: I will invite all the sages with pious activities who will render assistance in the ritual, oh, king, 
then you can perform the ritual self-composedly. [1-59-3]

Shlok 4: You can go to heaven with this body of yours, as well as with the form which is deformed by the curse 
of mentor Vashishta through his sons. [1-59-4]

Shlok 5: 'I deem that heaven is handy to you, oh, king of subjects, as you have approached the all-sheltering 
Vishvamitra and sought shelter.' Thus Vishvamitra solaced Trishanku. [1-59-5]

Shlok 6: On saying thus to Trishanku that great-resplendent Vishvamitra ordered his highly righteous and astutely 
brilliant sons to organise the arrangements for the ritual. [1-59-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: Vishvamitra calling forth all of his disciples said this sentence, 'oh boys invite all the eminent sages who 
are well-read in many Veda-s, along with their disciples and friends, and their ritwiks, the conductors 
of rituals at my order.' [1-59-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: 'If someone speaks inconsiderately incited by the forcefulness of my word, whoever speaks it, whichever 
word it may be, all that is to be reported to me, whatever it is.' Thus Vishvamitra ordered his disciples. 
[1-59-8]

Shlok 9b- 10a: On listening that word of Vishvamitra his disciples went to all directions inviting all by his order, 
and then the Vedic scholars started to arrive from all provinces. [1-59-9 b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: All of the disciples have returned to the fulgently resplendent sage Vishvamitra, and reported the 
words spoken by all the Vedic scholars. [1-59-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: 'On listening your word all the Brahmans from all provinces have started to come and some have already 
come, leaving alone Mahodaya, the son of Vashishta.' Thus, the disciples have started to inform Vishvamitra. 
[1-59-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: What all said by those hundred sons of Vashishta is explosively worded in their fury, oh, eminent 
sage, and what all they have said that you may please listen. [1-59-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: 'A Kshatriya is the officiator, and a profaner is the performer. How then the gods or sages can partake 
of the remnants of oblations in that ritual-assembly, especially that of a profaner?' Thus, the sons 
of Vashishta exclaimed. [1-59-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] One who is uninitiated into any esoteric knowledge is venturing to perform a Vedic ritual and a king, 
who can perform a ritual, but who cannot officiate ritual or teach Veda-s like a Brahman, is officiating 
it. Thus both of these, officiator and performer have no Vedic sanctity.

Shlok 14b- 15a: Though the Brahmans or the high-souled sages are now embarrassed by Vishvamitra, how can they go 
to heaven even after their demise, partaking of the food of a profaner? [1-59-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: 'Oh, tigerly sage Vishvamitra, all the sons of Vashishta including Mahodaya spoke these derisive sentences 
with their eyes reddening in anger.' Thus, the disciples reported to Vishvamitra. [1-59-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: The eminent sage Vishvamitra having heard those words of the sons of Vashishta from all of his disciples, 
said this rancorously with bloodshot eyes. [1-59-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: He who reproves me, who am abiding in rigorous ascesis, and who am an unreprovable one by my ascetic 
merit, that irreverent person will be reduced to ashes, and there is no doubt about it. [1-59-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Now they will be dragged by the lasso of Time to the House of Yama, the Terminator, and from now 
to seven hundred births to come they take birth as devourers of corpses, come what may. [1-59-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Those who reprove me will be wandering about these mortal worlds on taking birth as disfigured and 
deformed beings in the ruthless sect of Mustika-s that always feed on dog's flesh. [1-59-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: That wrong-headed Mahodaya also reproached me, who am irreproachable on my part, hence he gets into 
tribal-hood and becomes a reproachable tribal for the entire world. [1-59-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: By my fury he obtains an utter barbarity and he will be occupied with a murderous bent, and he cycles 
through a worst possible living for a long time. [1-59-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b: On saying this much sentence of curse among the sages who have already arrived, that great-resplendent, 
greatly ascetic, great sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-59-22]

[Commentary] The poet in the last line remembers the sages who have already arrived, only to say that, 'had they 
not come at the beck and call of Vishvamitra, they too are liable for the above curses, maybe some more 
curses too, from Vishvamitra. So, knowing this Vedic-ritual of ineligible Trishanku and unqualified 
Vishvamitra is an improper egotistical extravaganza of Vishvamitra, those who have already come, have 
come at the cost of their Brahman-hood.'



SARGA 60
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra effectuates Trishanku's travel to heaven, but Indra throws him down as Trishanku has not 
acquired any merit to reach heaven. Vishvamitra enraged at this starts to replicate universe with constellation 
of stars and galaxies, and he proceeds to clone even gods. On seeing this chaotic situation, Indra with 
gods yield to the pertinence of Vishvamitra and allow that which Vishvamitra replicated to survive and 
also allow Trishanku to inhibit that pseudo Creation, but with an upside down posture.

Shlok 1: "The great-resplendent Vishvamitra on knowing through his ascetic power about the ruination of the sons 
of Vashishta, along with Mahodaya, proclaimed this amidst the observance of sages." Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Trishanku's legend. [1-60-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: 'This legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty is well-know as Trishanku, a righteous and benevolent one. He came 
under my shelter as he wishes to win over the heaven of gods with his own mortal body.' So Vishvamitra 
started to speak to sages. [1-60-2, 3b]

Shlok 3b- 4a: 'You all scholars have to conduct Vedic-ritual along with in such a way as to how Trishnaku reaches 
the heaven of gods.' Thus Vishvamitra advised the conductors of the ritual. [1-60-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: On listening the words of Vishvamitra all those great-sages have come together and quickly discussed 
among themselves about what is agreeable to righteousness, as they are the knowers of scruples of conducting 
Vedic-rituals, but such a ritual is desultory. [1-60-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: Whatever Vishvamitra says let it be translated entirely and exhaustively into deeds called ritual. 
This Vishvamitra is the legatee of Sage Kushi, and indeed he is a saint similar to Ritual-fire besides 
being an extremely furious person. Otherwise this awesome sage gives curse, rancorously. [1-60-5b, 6]

Shlok 7- 8a: 'As such, let the Vedic-ritual be conducted intending and enabling Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku, 
to go to heaven by the ritualist prowess of Vishvamitra, therefor you conduct yourselves and you all 
preside over it.' Thus, the officiators conceded among themselves. [1-60-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: Concluding thus those great-sages undertook concerned works of that Vedic-ritual and the great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra himself became its principal officiator. [1-60-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Those hymnodists who are the experts in hymnodies have scripturally carried out all ceremonies 
in a methodical way with inviolable hymnal methods, and as per Kalpa treatise, that lays down the rules 
for conducting such rituals. [1-60-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: After a long time that highly ascetical Vishvamitra welcomed all the gods to receive their allotted 
oblations in that ritual. [1-60-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: Then all of the gods who are invited to partake of the oblation have not come forward to receive their 
allotments, and then the great-saint Vishvamitra, obsessive with fury, furiously lifted up a wooden-oblational-scoop, 
and said this to Trishanku. [1-60-11b, 12]

Shlok 13- 14a: Oh, ruler of people, now you shall see the potency of my ascesis which I personally achieved. Such 
as I am I shall lead you forth to haven with your own body just by my personal capability. Oh, king 
of people, now you will go to heaven with your own mortal body, which is otherwise unattainable. [1-60-13, 
14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: 'May it be a little, but there is some fruit of my ascesis, isn't it! Oh, king, you will journey to 
heaven with your own body owing to that prowess of my ascesis.' Vishvamitra said so to Trishanku. [1-60-14b, 
15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Once the sage Vishvamitra said those words, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, that king Trishanku soared to heaven 
with his mortal body, before the very eyes of other sages." Sage Shataananda continued. [1-60-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: On seeing Trishanku's entry into the realm of heaven, Indra, the subjugator of demon Paaka, spoke this 
sentence together with all the multitudes of gods. [1-60-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Oh, Trishanku, you have not yet made heaven as your haunt, hence retrace your steps. As you are thrashed 
by the damning of your mentor Vashishta, you inane human, again fall down on earth, but with your head 
inversed. [1-60-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: When Mahendra said so, Trishanku loudly exclaiming at the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra saying, 'save 
me, save me,' and fell down from heaven. [1-60-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: On hearing the exclamatory sentence of Trishanku who is shouting it loudly, Vishvamitra assumed an 
abnormal anger and also said, 'wait... wait...' [1-60-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21- 22a: Like the other Creator that resplendent Vishvamitra, himself staying among sages, has replicated Southerly 
Ursa Major in southerly direction. And still remaining amidst of sages that highly reputed sage Vishvamitra 
further started to replicate the stereotyped stocks of stars sequentially, resorting to the southern 
hemisphere, as he is convulsed in anger at Indra. [1-60-20b, 21, 22a]

[Commentary] Ursa Major is a prominent constellation in the northern sky, containing seven bright stars in a pattern 
variously called the Plough, the Big Dipper, or Charles's Wain. Also called Great Bear. In Latin it 
is, Ursa= greater (she-) bear. The Indian name to this is: saptaRShi-maNDala Hence Vishvamitra 
adopted the opposite direction, namely southern direction, for his Creation, which shall be in direct 
opposition to the natural creation adopted by Almighty. From this point onwards, anything artificially 
or synthetically created, cloned, or replicated from natural item acquired the name of vishvaamitra- 
sR^iSTi 'Vishvamitra's cloning,' including the present day hybrids. Whether this Ursa Major like 
constellation is still available in southern hemisphere - is a point left to astronomers, or stargazers.

Shlok 22b- 23: On replicating the stereotyped stocks of other galaxies and stars, and while fury continued to blemish 
him Vishvamitra said, 'I will now clone an alternative Indra, or let that realm created by me remain 
without any Indra,' and when he is about to proceed to clone even gods in his wrath, the gods are startled. 
[1-60-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: The gods are highly startled at Vishvamitra's creation, and they along with demons and with observances 
of hermits addressed the great-souled Vishvamitra with placatory words. [1-60-24]

Shlok 25: 'Oh great-fortunate Vishvamitra, this king Trishnaku is damned by his mentor, hence oh, ascetically 
wealthy sage, he is not at all eligible to go to heaven with his mortal body.' So said gods to Vishvamitra. 
[1-60-25]

Shlok 26: On hearing that sentence of those gods, the eminent saint Kaushika spoke this highly laudable sentence 
to all of the gods. [1-60-26]

Shlok 27: Let safety betide you all. I have promised to this king Trishanku that he will ascend to heaven with 
his mortal body, and I am not interested to make it untrue. [1-60-27]

Shlok 28- 29: 'Let there be eternal heaven to Trishanku with his mortal body. Next, as along as the worlds remain, 
let all of these stars and galaxies I have created also remain eternally in their places as my creation. 
It will be apt of you all gods to accede to this.' So said Vishvamitra to gods. [1-60-28, 29]

Shlok 30- 31- 32a: When all the gods are addressed thus they replied the eminent saint Vishvamitra saying, 'so be it! 
Safe you be! Let all the created objects prevail in their respective places. Those amazing and numerous 
stars you have created will remain in firmament, but outside the path of stelliform of Cosmic Person. 
Trishanku will also remain in the circle of stars you created, but upside-down, for Indra's indict cannot 
be annulled, and he will be gleaming like a star and similar to any celestial. [1-60-30, 31, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: 'According to their wont to circumambulate someone who has gone to heavenly worlds, all the stars 
will suppliantly circumambulate this best king Trishanku, who has achieved his ends and who has become 
an acclaimed one with your tour de force.' So said gods to Vishvamitra in deterring his further cloning 
of a simulative Universe. [1-60-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: Even the benign-souled Vishvamitra, when reverenced by all gods, that great-resplendent sage without 
stirring himself from among the sages said to all gods, 'Agreed!' [1-60-33]

Shlok 34b: Oh, best one among men Rama, later at the end of that ritual great-souled gods and ascetically wealthy 
sages went away as they have come. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the narration of the legend. [1-60-34]

[Commentary] Trishanku is the son of one Suuryaaruna and his original name is Satyavrat and this name Trishanku is 
his pseudonym. He got this because three sins are attached to him tri-shanka-s 
as said in another work Harivamsha. There it is said: pituH shaapaadi doSheNa | gurudogdhre vadhena 
ca | aprokShito prayogaat ca | trividhaa tat vyatikramaH | evam triiNi asya shankuuni | One by 
his father's damnation - when he misbehaved in his kingdom, his father being a righteous king exiles 
him to a wretched place. When his father was exiling him, Trishanku took umbrage at Vashishta, because 
Vashishta did not come to his rescue. The second blemish is due to the killing Vashishta's milch cow, 
knowingly. Trishanku kills that cow, when he did not get any food for the day to feed the son of Vishvamitra. 
At that time, he had to protect the wife and three sons of Vishvamitra, as Vishvamitra has gone away 
to a distant place for his ascesis, leaving his kingdom and family. Then Trishanku comes to the rescue 
of his family. With that gratitude, now Vishvamitra tries to requite this king in sending him to heaven. 
The third damnation is for his usage of unsanctified meat of his kill. Thus, Trishanku is the one who 
carries 'three social blemishes' on his head, and added to these is the curse of Vashishta, in making 
him as a profaner.

[Commentary] Further, a god or teacher cannot be dragged to one's side or his wishful thinking, but they are to be 
attained or appeased with constant faith and servitude. guroH aliikanirbandho na kartavyaH kadaacana 
| anumaanya prasaaH ca gurukruddho yudhiShTara | shiShyo gurau narashreShTa pratikuulam na sa~ncaret 
| viShNu puraaNa And if god created the cosmos, a man trying to duplicating it, is as good as going 
against that writ of that god. Vishvamitra no doubt built many space stations and started cloning gods, 
leave alone earthly species, but he is forestalled, because he wanted to break the system from within, 
in which he is and by which he mastered all this expertise. It is as good as cutting the branch of a 
tree on which he is sitting. Absolute insolence is absolutely condemnable. Hence, Trishanku is still 
dangling upside down in his so-called heaven.



SARGA 61
------------------------------

[Text] The Legend of Shunashepa is commenced and Sage Shataananda continues this as a part 
of Vishvamitra's legend. When Rama's grandparent Ambariisha undertook a ritual, 
Indra impounds that ritual's horse. Then Ambariisha had to fetch a human-animal 
in lieu of that lost horse. When none is available one named Shunashepa, son of 
Sage Riciika, and a nephew of Vishvamitra, offers himself with a barter of riches 
to his parents.

Shlok 1: "Oh, tigerly man Rama, on giving farewell to those sages who came at his invitation 
and who have started to go back after the ritual of Trishanku is over, then that 
great-resplendent Vishvamitra spoke to all of the sages who are forest dwellers 
that remained with him." Thus Shatananda continued to narrate the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-61-1]

Shlok 2: While depending on this southern quarter this gross hindrance has cropped up 
for my ascesis in the shape of Trishanku's ascent to heaven, hence we will go to 
another direction, and there we continue ascesis. [1-61-2]

Shlok 3: 'Oh, great-souled sages, we can conveniently undertake our ascesis in the vast 
of westerly direction where holy lakesides are there. That would be an august ascetical 
forest, isn't it.' Thus Vishvamitra said to fellow sages in his camp. [1-61-3]

Shlok 4: On saying thus that most brilliant and great saint Vishvamitra performed an unhindered 
and rigorous ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers after reaching the lakeside 
of holy lakes. [1-61-4]

Shlok 5: In the meanwhile the great king of Ayodhya, renowned as Ambariisha, embarked on 
to perform a Vedic-ritual. [1-61-5]

Shlok 6: But Indra impounded the animal of the principal of that ritual, namely king Ambariisha, 
and when that animal is really vanished, the officiant Brahman of the ritual spoke 
this to that king. [1-61-6]

Shlok 7: Oh, king, the animal you have fetched for the ritual has gone astray owing to 
your incautiousness. Oh, king, unguarded items of the ritual will themselves become 
destructive blemishes for that king who is performing the ritual. [1-61-7]

Shlok 8: 'Oh, the best man among men, you have to make great amends for the loss of animal 
as that animal alone which was intended but now missing shall be used in ritual. 
Or, a man may be fetched as ritual-animal, and only after that the deeds of the 
ritual can be continued.' Thus, the priests of the ritual said to king Ambariisha. 
[1-61-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing the words of his teacher, oh, the best one among men, Rama, he that 
highly rule-obedient king tried for a human-ritual-animal for a barter of thousands 
of cows. [1-61-9]

Shlok 10- 11: While that king is searching those and those provinces, villages, forests, townships, 
and even the pious hermitages, oh, dear Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, that 
king has indeed seen Sage Riciika, who is well settled on Mt. Bhrigutunga along 
with his sons and wife. [1-61-10, 11]

Shlok 12- 13a: On reverencing and on obtaining the grace of ascetically brilliant great Sage Riciika, 
and even on asking him about his wellbeing in every aspect, that kingly sage Ambariisha, 
who is with great resplendence and whose brilliance is illimitable, said this word 
to that sage. [1-61-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Oh, godlike sage, if you bargain your son with a hundred thousand cows for the 
purpose of a ritual-animal, oh, the successor Sage Bhrigu, I deem my ends are achieved. 
[1-61-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: 'All the provinces are went over but unobtainable is that animal of the ritual, 
hence it will be apt of you to give me one son from among your sons, for a value.' 
Thus, king Ambariisha bargained with the sage. [1-61-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: When that great-resplendent Sage Riciika is addressed thus, he said this word, 
'oh, best of men, I cannot possibly sell my eldest son, in anyway.' [1-61-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: On hearing the words of Sage Riciika the mother of those great-souled sons spoke 
this word to the tigerly-man Ambariisha. [1-61-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: The most reverential sage and the one from Bhaargava dynasty, my husband, said 
that the eldest son is un-sellable. Thereof oh, lord, you must know that my youngest 
son, namely Shunaka, is a cherished one for me. Therefore oh, king, I will not give 
my youngest son to you, either. [1-61-17b, 18]

Shlok 19: 'Generally eldest sons are fathers' favourites, oh, best king among men, and mothers' 
favourites are the youngest, isn't it! Therefor, I have to tend my youngest son.' 
Thus, wife Sage Ruciika said to Ambariisha. [1-61-19]

[Commentary] The wife of the Sage Ruciika is Satyavathi, the sister of Vishvamitra whose legend 
was narrated by Vishvamitra in Bala Ch. 34. This longing for youngest sons by a 
mother is reflected in Maha Bharata, where Kunti pleads for leaving Sahadeva, the 
youngest Pandava, from going to forest exile, along with her in the city. In 
sabhaa-parva she says: sabhaa-parvaNi sahadevam prati kuntiivaakyam - sahadeva nivartasva nanu tvam 
asi me priyaH | shariiraat api maadreyaa maamatyakShiiH kuputravat | - aashramavaase 
dharmaputram prati kuntiivaakyam - sahadevamaaraaja maa pramaadam kR^ithaa | 
- dk Kunti, the mother of Pandava-s says: 'oh, Sahadeva, you refrain 
from going on exile as you are a dear son of mine, though Maadri gave you a bodily 
birth, you are my favourite...' Also, in the period of forest exile she says to 
Yudhishtar: 'oh, king, let no danger occur to Sahadeva... as he is my cherished 
son...'

Shlok 20: Oh, Rama, when that sage's sentence is so, and his wife's sentence is also in that 
way only, their intermediate son, namely Shunashepa, personally spoke this sentence. 
[1-61-20]

Shlok 21: Father said that the eldest son is un-sellable, mother also said the same about 
youngest one. Then I deem that the intermediary son is sellable. Hence, oh, prince, 
you may lead me forth. [1-61-21]

Shlok 22- 23: Oh, dextrous Rama, when that advocate of Veda-s, namely Shunashepa finished his 
speech, then the king gave gold, silver, and gemstones, each in ten million heaps, 
and even a hundred thousand cows, and oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that king Ambariisha 
went away highly gladdened to take Shunashepa with him. [1-61-22, 23]

Shlok 24: "That great resplendent and highly renowned king Ambariisha on his part proceeded 
hastily after ascending Shunashepa onto the chariot that hastily." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration. [1-61-24]



SARGA 62
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra curses his sons as they defy his orders and accords two esoteric 
hymns to Shunashepa, for chanting them in the Vedic-ritual of Ambariisha. Shunashepa 
gets longevity on chanting those hymns. Thus Vishvamitra not only creates another 
universe as in Trishanku's episode, he even accords longevity, or even deathlessness 
to mortals by his ascetic power. Such as he is, he is the mentor of Rama, and hence 
Sage Shataananda informs Rama about the capabilities of his own mentor, Vishvamitra, 
in these many episodes.

Shlok 1: "Oh, Rama, the best one among men and the legatee of Raghu, on taking Shunashepa 
that highly renowned king Ambariisha took rest at noontime on the lakeside of Holy 
Lake." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shunashepa, as a part of Vishvamitra's 
legend. [1-62-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: While the king Ambariisha is taking rest that highly brilliant Shunashepa came 
to the lakeside of main Holy Lake with high anxiety, and there he indeed saw his 
maternal uncle Sage Vishvamitra who is performing ascesis along with other sages. 
[1-62-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: Shunashepa became pitiable and sulky faced by strain and thirst, oh, Rama, and 
he immediately fell in the lap of saint Vishvamitra saying this sentence. [1-62-3b, 
4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: I have no mother or a father to save me. Then wherefore cousins or relatives 
will be there to protect me. Oh, peaceable saint the eminent, it will be apt of 
you to protect me according to saintliness. [1-62-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: Oh, illustrious sage, you alone are the saviour to each and every one, isn't 
it! You alone are the guardian angel, isn't it! Hence, let the purpose of the king 
Ambariisha be achieved, and let longevity come to me, and I on becoming imperishable 
and indeed on performing an unexcelled ascesis, I wish to enjoy in heavenly worlds. 
[1-62-5b, 6]

Shlok 7: ' You shall be my providence with a providential sentiment as I stand unprotected, 
and oh, virtue souled one, it will be apt of you to protect me from misfortune, 
like a father protecting his own son.' Thus Shunashepa appealed to Vishvamitra. 
[1-62-7]

Shlok 8: On hearing that sentence of Shunashepa and on pacifying him in many ways, Vishvamitra 
of higher ascesis, indeed said this to his sons. [1-62-8]

Shlok 9: For what reason parents engender sons, desiring positivity and for the purpose 
of welfare in the other worlds, this is the time that has come for fulfilling that 
reason. [1-62-9]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'A father's ambition in begetting sons is to do something good and positive 
to the society in the present world and when departed a right place is acquired 
in heavens through these sons, by their yearly death-day rituals etc., and hence 
you do some good in saving this boy from premature death and earn an apt place for 
me in heavens...'

Shlok 10: This youngster is the son of sage and he aspires shelter from me. Hence, oh, 
sons, give him satisfaction just by giving life to him. [1-62-10]

Shlok 11: You all have done very good pious deeds and you all abide by probity. Hence, 
you bestow appeasement to Fire-god on your becoming the ritual-animals of king Ambariisha 
in lieu of this boy Shunashepa. [1-62-11]

Shlok 12: 'As a result, Shunashepa will have protectors, Vedic-ritual will be unimpeded, 
gods will be oblated, and my word too will be actualised.' Thus Vishvamitra said 
to his sons. [1-62-12]

Shlok 13: But on hearing the saying of the sage, oh, Rama, the best of men, Madhushyanda 
and the other sons of Vishvamitra said this, haughtily and disparagingly. [1-62-13]

Shlok 14: 'On sacrificing your own sons how can you save another's son, oh, lordly father, 
we deem this as a wrongdoing and as good as dog's meat in a dinner.' Thus the sons 
of Vishvamitra replied their father. [1-62-14]

[Commentary] Vishvamitra will be nagged by almost all, including his sons, on this 'dog-meat-eating.' 
There is a parable in Maha Bharata that Vishvamitra once tried to eat dog's meat 
when he did not get any food, but caught red-handedly. Later this has become the 
curse-theme to Vishvamitra when he cursed Vashishta's sons. At the present juncture 
also he curses his own sons with the same theme.

Shlok 15: On listening that saying of his sons that eminent sage Vishvamitra started to curse 
them while fury reddened his eyes. [1-62-15]

Shlok 16: You all have not only transgressed my word, but pertly replied me in an impudent 
manner which is abhorrent and hair-raising, and recriminatory according to probity. 
[1-62-16]

Shlok 17: 'You all will be whirling around the earth totally for a thousand years taking 
birth in the race that subsists on dog's meat, like the sons of Vashishta.' Thus 
Vishvamitra cursed his sons. [1-62-17]

Shlok 18: On making his sons bounden by curse, then that best saint spoke to the pitiable 
Shunashepa, on making unharmed invulnerability to him with sanctifying hymns. [1-62-18]

Shlok 19: When you are fastened with sacred fastener to the sacrificial post of Vishnu, 
smeared with red paste and garlanded with red garlands, you praisefully address 
the Fire-god with the words I going to impart to you in Vedic hymns. [1-62-19]

Shlok 20: 'These two divine hymns, oh, son of saint, shall be chanted in the Vedic-ritual 
of Ambariisha, then you will obtain your aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra taught two 
Vedic hymns to the boy. [1-62-20]

Shlok 21: Shunashepa having taken those two hymns from Vishvamitra very attentively has instantly 
gone to that lion-king Ambariisha and indeed spoke to him. [1-62-21]

Shlok 22: 'Oh, the lion-king, let us go promptly to your ritual place, oh, best king, you 
may apply yourself to your pledge in completing the ritual, with me as its sacrificial 
animal,' thus the boy said. [1-62-22]

Shlok 23: On listening that sentence of the son of sage, the king Ambariisha is gladdened 
and proceeded to the ritual hall immediately and spiritedly. [1-62-23]

Shlok 24: The king with the permission of officiators of ritual got the boy prepared as a 
ritual animal with sanctified bodily features and clad him in red clothes and got 
him securely fastened to the sacrificial post. [1-62-24]

Shlok 25: When Shunashepa is tied to ritual post he immensely pleased two gods, namely Indra 
and Upendra as well, with those two hymns he got from Vishvamitra. [1-62-25]

Shlok 26: Then the Thousand-eyed Indra who is satisfied with esoteric laudation is gladdened, 
and oh, Raghava, then he bestowed longevity to Shunashepa. [1-62-26]

Shlok 27: Oh, Rama, the best one among men, he that king Ambariisha also obtained the fruits 
of that Vedic-ritual in manyfold, resulted from the grace of Thousand-eyed Indra. 
[1-62-27]

Shlok 28: "Oh, Rama, the best among men, even the virtue-souled great ascetic Vishvamitra 
again performed ascesis at the same Holy lakeside for another thousand years." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued the narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-62-28]



SARGA 63
------------------------------

[Text] On Vishvamitra's performing severe ascesis Brahma accords the sageship of 'Great-sage' 
to him, whereas Vishvamitra's ambition is to acquire the sageship of a 'Brahma-sage' 
Absolute-sageship. In the meanwhile, the celestial wench Menaka arrives at that 
place and Vishvamitra is enticed by her beauty and spends some years with her. Later, 
on realising the he should have won over lust, he further undertakes severe ascesis, 
by which gods are perturbed.

Shlok 1: "When thousand years are completed in ascesis and when that great saint Vishvamitra 
took a bath of solemnity, all the gods have come forward wishing to accord the fruit 
of that ascesis to Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-63-1]

Shlok 2: The very highly resplendent Brahma spoke to him with highly palatable words, 'you 
have now become a kingly sage by virtue of auspicious deeds you have personally 
undertaken, let safeness betide you.' [1-63-2]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'so far, you are a king and by your auspicious deeds now you have become 
a 'kingly sage' raajaSi and to attain a still higher brahmarSi 
'Absolute sageship' you are not yet merited... as the Absolute sageship will be 
endowed to those who are above the negative traits of humans, like greed, anger, 
lust, jealousy etc.'

Shlok 3: On speaking to Vishvamitra in that way Brahma returned to heaven, and that highly 
vigorous Vishvamitra again performed a great ascesis. [1-63-3]

[Commentary] The word vi in the name of Vishvamitra is taken as the third syllable in 
Gayatri Hymn.

Shlok 4: Then at a long lost time Menaka, the prominent apsara, celestial wench, has arrived 
and started to swim for sport in that holy lake. [1-63-4]

Shlok 5: That great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has seen Menaka who is incomparable in 
her mien and comparable to an electric-flash in a black-cloud, while she is swimming 
in the holy lake. [1-63-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: On seeing her the sage having gone under the sway the Love-god said this to her, 
'oh, apsara, you are welcome, I invite you to bide in my hermitage. Oblige me who 
am bewitched by Love-god for you. You be safe.' [1-63-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8- 9a: When he said thus to her, oh, Raghava, then she made a stopover there and ten years 
rolled by comfortably, and oh, gentle Rama, because of her staying Vishvamitra is 
indeed faced with a great hindrance in his ascesis. [1-63-7b, 8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: Then after the lapse of that ten year period Vishvamitra became doleful with distress 
and he is enwrapped in humiliation, as it were, and, oh, Rama, Raghu's legatee, 
then a resentful thought occurred to him. [1-63-9b, 10]

Shlok 11- 12a: All this is the mischief of gods to defraud me of the great merit of my ascesis. 
Ten years have rolled by as if they are just a day and a night. Furthermore, I who 
am under the influence of lust and lure had to encounter this hindrance in my ascesis. 
[1-63-11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13- 14a: Oh, Rama, that best saint suspired heavily when he became emotional with reparation. 
But on seeing the scared celestial wench Menaka, who is shivering and waiting with 
suppliantly adjoined palms, he sent her away with pleasant words, and he that Vishvamitra 
indeed went to the northern Himalayan mountain. [1-63-12b, 13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: He that highly celebrated sage who made a resolve to attain a sang-froid temperament 
and to vanquish lust, performed an unsurpassable ascesis on reaching the riverbank 
of River Kaushiki. [1-63-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Oh, Rama, while he reverently performed an unspeakable ascesis for a thousand years 
on the northern mountain, namely Himalayas, then fear occurred to gods. [1-63-15b, 
16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: ' All gods coming together with assemblages of sages have approached Brahma and conveyed 
that, 'this Vishvamitra, the son of Kushika, may duly be given the epithet of 'Maharshi, 
Exalted Sage.' [1-63-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: On listening the advice of gods, Brahma, the Grandparent of all the worlds, spoke 
these pleasant words to the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra. [1-63-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: 'Oh, exalted sage, I welcome you my dear, as I am gladdened by your stern ascesis, 
oh, Kaushika, I bestow upon you the sublimity and supremacy among sages.' [1-63-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: And on hearing the words of Brahma he that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra became 
obeisant and replied the Grandparent adjoining his palms suppliantly. [1-63-19b, 
20a]



'If your Godhead had said that I am a Brahma-sage, a sageship acquired personally 
by my pious deeds, rather than an exalted sage, then I would have become one who 
is really self-conquered.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Brahma. [1-63-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: Brahma then said to him, 'your senses remain unconquered as such, oh, tigerly sage, 
make an effort for it.' Saying so Brahma went heavenward. [1-63-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: While the gods who came here along with Brahma have returned, that great sage Vishvamitra 
undertook another round of ascesis by standing in levitation, upraising his arms, 
and subsisting on air alone. [1-63-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24: In summer he became the Five-Fire Ascetic, in rainy season open sky is his rooftop, 
and in winter water is his reclining bed even by day or by night, and thus that 
ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra indeed undertook a severe ascesis in this way, for 
another thousand years. [1-63-23b, 24]

[Commentary] Five fires are four Fires in four directions and the fifth one is the scorching 
sun, overhead. An ascetic staying among these five fires will become an ascetic 
fire. The first word in first foot dharme, will also used as gharme, 
as above, in some mms.

Shlok 25: While that great saint is undertaking fervent ascesis it has become a very high 
burning problem to gods and even to Indra. [1-63-25]

Shlok 26: "Then Indra along with all the assemblages of the Air-gods spoke to Rambha, the 
celestial wench, words that are advantageous to himself, but disadvantageous to 
the son of sage Kushi, namely Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration. [1-63-26]



SARGA 64
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra curses Rambha, the celestial wench, knowing that she arrived at the behest of Indra to cause 
hindrance to his ascesis. But later feels ashamed to loose his tongue and then he is determined to undertake 
another round of ascesis to conquer is own senses.

Shlok 1: "Oh, Rambha, now you have to undertake this very great task of gods in enchanting Vishvamitra with 
a craving caused by lust, for lusting after you.' Thus Indra ordered Rambha..." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-64-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, Rama, when that celestial wench is spoken thus by the Thousand-eyed Indra, she diffidently said 
to that chief of gods while adjoining her palms suppliantly. [1-64-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: 'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, that great saint Vishvamitra is a dangerous one and undoubtedly he releases 
his deadly anger on me. Oh, god, thereby I am fearful of him. Hence, oh, god, it will be apt of you 
to accord forbearance.' So said Rambha to Indra. [1-64-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: Oh, Rama, the Thousand-eyed Indra replied Rambha when she spoke to him in that way while shuddering 
in fear and making palm fold in supplication. [1-64-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: You need not be fearful, Rambha, carry out my command, safe betides you, I on becoming a heart-stealing 
black-songbird will be at your side along with Love-god in the pleasing trees of springtime. [1-64-5b, 
6]

Shlok 7: 'Indeed on your assuming a highly sparkling semblance, and multi-multiplexing your savoir faire, with 
bon viveurs and bon vivants, you disengage that ascetical sage Kaushika from his ascesis.' So said Indra 
to Rambha. [1-64-7]

Shlok 8: On hearing the sentence of Indra she adopted an unexcelled physique, and on becoming a pulchritudinous 
damsel she started to entice Vishvamitra with giggly grins. [1-64-8]

Shlok 9: Vishvamitra has heard melodious trilling tune of songbird, and while his heart is highly gladdening 
about the ambience, he incidentally saw and stared at Rambha. [1-64-9]

Shlok 10: By the exceptional trilling tune of that songbird and by the unexceptional tableau of Rambha the sage 
is on his qui vive. [1-64-10]

Shlok 11: On knowing that as an escapade of the Thousand-eyed Indra, Vishvamitra is enwrapped in wrath and he 
cursed Rambha. [1-64-11]

Shlok 12: Whereof you tried to entice me who am wishing to win over the wanton and wroth, you unlucky female 
Rambha, thereof you will become a rocklike statued wastrel. [1-64-12]

Shlok 13: 'A highly resplendent Brahman who is ascetically powerful redeems you, oh, Rambha, who are now blemished 
by my anger.' Vishvamitra cursed Rambha in this way. [1-64-13]

[Commentary] This ascetically powerful Brahman-saviour of Rambha is none other than the Sage Vashishta, the brainchild 
of Brahma. Even though Vishvamitra is at loggerheads with Vashishta, he holds Vashishta in high respect.

Shlok 14: Thus the great-resplendent Vishvamitra became compunctious when that great-saint could not contain 
his anger in uttering an angry curse. [1-64-14]

[Commentary] Angering for trivial reasons, or on trivially inferiors ones is a demeritorious triviality in loosing 
ascetic power. Irrestrainable temperament will not only ruin the ascetic powers but also breeds a prolonged 
compunction. Manu defines jitendriya as one who shrutvaa spR^iShTvaa ca dR^iShTvaa ca 
bhuktvaa ghraatvaa ca yau naraH | na hR^iShyati glaayati vaa sa vij~neyo jitendriyaH || - manu'he 
who on hearing, touching, seeing, eating, smelling, but neither gladdens nor saddens, is a self-senses-conquered 
one...' The same is said in Bhagavad Gita, and the whole of karma-yoga deals with the same 
subject, and it is said there: tasmaat tvam indriyaaNyaadau niyamya bharatarShabha paapmaanam prajahi 
hyenam j~naanavij~naananaashanam || giitaa 3-41

[Commentary] He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, / Disparting self from service, soul from works, 
/ Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince! / Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain / With sword of 
wisdom, Son of Bharata! - Sir Edwin Arnold.

Shlok 15: Then Rambha has become a rocklike statue by that great curse of Vishvamitra, and having heard the words 
of that great-saint Love-god and Indra also took flight. [1-64-15]

Shlok 16: Owing to his angering that great-resplendent Vishvamitra is now divested of his ascetical merit, and 
he has no peace of mind owing to ungovernable senses. [1-64-16]

Shlok 17: His conscience became sentimental owing to the divesture of his ascetical merit, and he soliloquised, 
'I shall not succumb to wrath in anyway, nor I put my presentiment into words.' [1-64-17]

Shlok 18: Otherwise, I do not even respire for a hundred years for the respiratory gestures will also exhibit 
moods, and I indeed emaciate myself until I become a real conqueror of my own senses. [1-64-18]

Shlok 19: 'Till such time as I acquire Brahman-hood with the merit of my own ascesis I will be breathless and 
foodless, even if it is going to take endless years, and while I am in ascesis my bodily organs indeed 
will not undergo any deterioration.' So said Vishvamitra to himself. [1-64-19]

Shlok 20: "Thus that eminent sage abided by the commitment to the vow for a thousand years, oh, Rama, the legatee 
of Ragu, which is a nonpareil vow in the world." Thus Shataananda continued. [1-64-20]



SARGA 65
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra becomes Brahma-sage after a prolonged ascesis that made all the worlds 
to startle. All gods request Brahma to accord the supreme Brahma-sageship on Vishvamitra 
as he is cleansed of all mortal impurities, and Brahma accords that highest order 
on him. Thus Sage Shataananda concludes his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra.

Shlok 1: "That great-saint Vishvamitra then leaving off the snowbound Himalayas on north, 
oh, Rama, he reached eastern quarter and undertook rigorous ascesis." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-65-1]

Shlok 2: Committing himself to a vow of muteness, oh, Rama, he performed an unexcelled and 
unmatched ascesis which is highly impracticable for others to perform. [1-65-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: Even on completing a thousand years, even when that great-saint became woodenly, 
even many barriers are at full blast, oh, Rama, fury has not entered his heart of 
hearts, for he stood fast in an unmitigated ascesis on making a firm determination. 
[1-65-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5: On one day when those thousand years of ascesis with the rigorous pledge of Vishvamitra 
are being completed, and when he started to eat his meal, oh, Rama, best of Raghu's 
dynasty, Indra arrived there disguising himself as a Brahman and requested for the 
readily available meal. [1-65-4b, 5]

[Commentary] This meal is prepared by Vishvamitra alone after a thousand years and such self-cooking 
of food by the ascetics is called, vaishvadevam, since it is a sacred 
preparation anena vaishvadeva ante samaagato atithiH svayam upoShyaapi sviiya annapradaanena 
sambhojya iti suucitam - dk

Shlok 6: Then that godly Vishvamitra willingly gave away all the readied meal to that Brahman, 
and as no meal is leftover by Brahman-Indra, that great-ascetic Vishvamitra starved 
himself. Vishvamitra did not speak a little to the Brahman in dissent as he is abided 
by his pledge of muteness, and he again remained in muteness and breath-control. 
Like that, he indeed carried on his ascesis. [1-65-6, 7]

Shlok 8- 9a: That eminent saint remained without respiration for another thousand years, and 
then fumes have started to emit from the head of sage who is controlling his breath, 
by which fumes the triad of worlds looked as if it is searing, and this startled 
all the worlds. [1-65-8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: Then the gods, sages, gandharva-s, serpents, reptiles, demons are puzzled at the 
ascesis of Vishvamitra, and as their own resplendence is dulled by the ascesis of 
Vishvamitra, thereby they are marred by this blemish of lowered resplendence, then 
all of them addressed the Grandparent, Brahma. [1-65-9b, 10]

Shlok 11: Even if that great-saint Vishvamitra is angered and allured in order to foil 
his ascetical ascendancy, by all of us and by all means oh, god, he is transcending 
these lures, angers, and passions by his ascesis. [1-65-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: Now, even an imperceptible imperfection does not really appear in him, but if 
his heartfelt desire is not meted out, he will devastate the triad of worlds with 
his ascetic power. [1-65-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: All the directions are all tumultuous, all the oceans are tempestuous, and all 
the mountains are eruptive, and nothing is bright. [1-65-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: The earth is highly tremulous, air is gusting turbulently, oh, Brahma, people 
tend to become non-theistic and we do not know what to do. [1-65-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: All the beings in the triad of the worlds are very highly perturbed at their 
senses and they are as though stupefied, and when juxtaposed the sun is lustreless 
before the resplendence of that great sage. [1-65-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Oh, God, great saint Vishvamitra turned out to be the embodiment of Fire-god, 
and before that great-resplendent and most reverential sage makes up his mind for 
total destruction of all worlds he is to be placated. [1-65-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: 'As to how the End-Time Fire entirely blazed away the triad of worlds previously, 
now this sage may do likewise, hence whatever is his predilection that may be given 
to him, even if he wants to become the potentate on the realm of gods.' Thus, all 
gods appealed to Brahma [1-65-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Then all the assemblages of gods keeping the Grandparent Brahma in their forefront 
appeared before that great souled Vishvamitra and said this harmonious word. [1-65-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Oh, Brahma-sage, you are welcome. We are much contented with your ascesis. Oh, 
Kaushika, you have achieved Bahaman-hood by your rigorous ascesis. [1-65-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: 'Along with the assemblages of Marut-Wind-gods, I bestow upon you a long life. 
Let blissfulness betide you. You be safe. Oh, gentle sage, you may take leave as 
you please.' Thus, Brahma said to Vishvamitra. [1-65-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: On hearing the word of Grandparent Brahma and the other residents of heaven, and 
on paying good devoirs to all of them that great saint cheerfully said. [1-65-21b, 
22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: If Brahman-hood and eternality have befallen on me, let the quintessence of AUM 
and vaSat syllables, and even all Veda-s patronise me. [1-65-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: 'Oh, gods, he who is the outstanding one among the geniuses of kingcraft, and 
among the scholars of Veda-s as well, even that Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma, 
shall acknowledge me in this way as Brahma-sage. Oh, the best gods, you may take 
leave if you can effectuate this ultimate yearning of mine.' Thus Vishvamitra requested 
the gods. [1-65-23b, 24]

Shlok 25: Then the best one among meditators Vashishta has come over there when the gods 
besought him to come, and he made friendship with Vishvamitra. He also said in this 
way to Vishvamitra, 'you are a Brahma-sage.' [1-65-25]

Shlok 26: 'No doubt, you are a Brahma-sage and everything will accrue to you in accordance 
with the sublimity of this sageship,' and when Vashishta said so to Vishvamitra, 
all the gods have gone away as they have come. [1-65-26]

Shlok 27: On getting his Brahman-hood even the virtue-souled Vishvamitra started to reverence 
the supreme among meditators and his counterpart Brahma-sage, namely Vashishta. 
[1-65-27]

Shlok 28: When his aim is effectuated Vishvamitra ambled all over the earth abiding in ascesis, 
and oh, Rama, this great souled sage Vishvamitra achieved Brahman-hood in this way. 
[1-65-28]

Shlok 29: "Oh, Rama, he is the best saint, he is the embodiment of ascesis, he is always obliged 
with righteousness, and he is the stronghold for fortitude." [1-65-29]

Shlok 30- 31a: On narrating the legend of Vishvamitra in this way that best Brahman and great-resplendent 
Sage Shataananda took respite. And on listening the narration of Sage Shataananda 
said in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, king Janaka said this sentence to Kushika's 
son, Vishvamitra, with suppliantly adjoined palms. [1-65-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, you happened to be here at this Vedic-ritual which 
is conducted by me, oh, Kaushika, that too, along with Rama and Lakshmana, the legatees 
of Kakutstha, thereby I am fortunate, I am much obliged. [31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: Oh, Brahman, I stand consecrated just by your graceful glance, and oh, great saint, 
I reckon that I have achieved many boons just glancing at you. [1-65-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: Oh, great-resplendent Brahman, myself and the noble souled Rama have heard about 
your great ascesis when Sage Shataananda extolled it comprehensively. [1-65-33b, 
34a]

Shlok 34b- 35: The congregationalists available in this Vedic-ritual congregation have also heard 
about your numerous endowments. Inestimable is your ascesis, infinite is your power, 
and oh, son of Kushika, your talents are everlastingly invaluable. [1-65-34b, 35]

Shlok 36: Oh, lord, there is no contentment to me while listening to your wondrous narratives, 
but oh nobleman, time for vespertine ritual is fast approaching as sun's sphere 
is dangling westward. [1-65-36]

Shlok 37: "Oh, great-resplendent sage, it will be apt of you to see me tomorrow. Oh, best 
meditator, it will be apt of you to permit me to leave for now." Thus Janaka sought 
leave from Vishvamitra. [1-65-37]

Shlok 38: When he is spoken in that way, the best saint Vishvamitra is pleased at heart, and 
praising Janaka, who too is pleased to meet the sage, immediately bid farewell to 
the best one among men, namely Janaka. [1-65-38]

Shlok 39: This way on saying to the best saint, the king of Mithila and the legatee of Videha 
lineage, immediately performed circumambulations along with his teachers and relatives 
to Vishvamitra in veneration. [1-65-39]

Shlok 40: Even that virtue souled Vishvamitra started towards his own camp along with Rama 
and Lakshmana, while being venerated by great sages who are available in the ritual-hall. 
[1-65-40]



SARGA 66
------------------------------

[Text] Legend of Shiva's bow is narrated as Vishvamitra asks Janaka to show that bow to 
Rama and Lakshmana, as they have come this far to have a glimpse of that great bow. 
Janaka, while narrating its history, makes an offer saying that his daughter Seetha 
will be given in marriage, if only Rama can string the bowstring of Shiva's bow. 
In the very same sixty-sixth chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, Valmiki narrates the birth 
of Hanuma through Jambavanta, elaborately. But here Valmiki informs through Janaka 
about the nature of birth of Seetha, very concisely, which gave raise to too much 
of debate about this enigmatic Seetha and her birth. Some points are given in the 
endnote.

Shlok 1: Then on performing morning time rites in the aurora of next morning, king Janaka 
invited great souled Vishvamitra, along with Raghava-s. [1-66-1]

Shlok 2: On reverencing Vishvamitra and the noble souled Raghava-s according to the formalities 
envisaged by scriptures, then the virtue souled Janaka spoke these words, indeed. 
[1-66-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, god, you are welcome, oh, holy sage, bid me as to what I should for you, for 
I am biddable by you, indeed... [1-66-3]

Shlok 4: When said thus by the foreseer Janaka, [who can foresee as to why Vishvamitra came 
with Raghava-s this far, and thus asked him as to what next is to be done,] that 
sage Vishvamitra, for he is presager and wordsmith, [and who knows what is to be 
done next,] said these words in reply to that valiant king Janaka. [1-66-4]

Shlok 5: These two are the sons of Dasharatha, well-renowned Kshatriya-s in world, and they 
are desirous to see that marvellous bow which has a place with you... [1-66-5]

Shlok 6: You may show that bow, well bodes you, and on beholding that bow the desire of 
these two princes will come true, and they will go back as they like... [1-66-6]

Shlok 7: But Janaka replied the great sage Vishvamitra when he was addressed thus, "I shall 
[firstly] tell by which reason that bow has its place here... [1-66-7]

Shlok 8: Oh, godly sage, there was a king renowned as Devaraata, sixth one from Nimi, [the 
originator of our lineage,] and this bow was handed down to him for custodial care 
by the Sublime Soul, Shiva... [1-66-8]

[Commentary] Some mms use the word jyeSTaH instead of SaSTa for Nimi 
and then the meaning is that Nimi's eldest son is Devaraata. Basing on the account 
that is given by Janaka at the time of Rama's mariage with Seetha, Devaraata is 
the sixth one from Nimi, the originator of Janaka's lineage.

Shlok 9: Once, during the devastation of the Vedic-ritual of Daksha Prajapati, the mettlesome 
god Rudra, rancorously outstretching the bowstring of this bow, said this to all 
gods, superciliously... [1-66-9]

Shlok 10: 'Oh, gods, whereby you have not apportioned my portion [of oblations in Vedic-ritual 
s, as I am also the] desirer of such portion, [thereby] I will shred the highly 
revered heads of yours with this bow...' [So said Shiva to gods.] [1-66-10]

Shlok 11: Then, oh, best saint Vishvamitra, all gods are truly dismayed, and on their supplicating, 
Bhava, namely Shiva, the God of Gods is gladdened... [1-66-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: And that Sublime Soul Shiva gladly gave that bow to all of the great souled gods, 
and oh, godly saint, then those great souled gods gave this gem of a bow of Shiva, 
the God of Gods, to our ancestor [Devaraata,] for custodial care... [1-66-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough [from the 
furrow is a baby girl... since she is] gained while consecrating the ritual-field, 
she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned... [1-66-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Hers is a non-uterine birth as she surfaced from the surface of the earth, but 
fostered as my own soul-born girl and I determined [to give her in marriage to 
a bridegroom where his] boldness is the only bounty, [I receive in that marriage...] 
[1-66-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] Comment: 'Dowry is property or money brought by a bride to her husband' and this 
is familiar throughout the world. In ancient India, there was a counterpart custom 
to this, called kanyaashulkam meaning 'some bounty, property or money 
offered by a bridegroom's family to the bride's family' since they are getting a 
worthy bride, coming into their family, not just as a mere wife of the bridegroom, 
but to upkeep and promote that family and its progeny. And this dowry or its counterpart 
is not compulsorily be paid in hard cash, but it may be any kind of gifts mutually 
exchanged, which has slowly developed into a mega havoc these days. Here Janaka 
wants the 'valour' of his prospective son-in-law as bounty due to him in the marriage 
of Seetha.

Shlok 15b- 16a: Oh, eminent sage, as my daughter has surfaced from the surface of earth and has 
come of age, the kings, [having heard my declaration that the bounty for Seetha 
is boldness alone,] have come and besought for her... [1-66-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: To all of those kings who are beseeching for the girl, I have not given my daughter, 
saying that she will be given for a bounty of boldness... [1-6-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Then all the kings convoked and on arriving at Mithila, then they wanted to ascertain 
the calibre [of the bow, vis-a-vis their own...] [1-66-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: For them, those who wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, that bow of Shiva 
is fetched to their proximity, but they are incapable to joggle it, or even to catch 
hold of it... [1-66-18b, 19a]

[Commentary] Comment: This bow of Shiva will be transported on a wheeled casket-cart with eight 
wheels and drawn by five thousand robust persons. This is narrated in next chapter. 
'It is drawn by drawn by five hundred bulls...' aananda-raamayana says 
so. In other versions of Ramayana, it is said that many people will pull that casket-cart, 
as one or two persons cannot haul it. Once, when Seetha was playing with other girls, 
their flowery ball of girl's rugby goes under this cart. None of her girlfriends 
is dare enough to near this bow-casket-cart, since it is a reverential casket-cart. 
But Seetha goes there and pushes that casket-cart aside with her left hand, as though 
it is a garland, and retrieves that flower ball. This capability of Seetha in easy 
handling of Shiva's bow, becomes a bane to her, when one among the wives of 
sapta-R^iSi 'Seven Sages...' issues a curse to Seetha, saying that 'Seetha 
will be separated from her husband for some time, of course, for the good of people...' 
So says the tradition.

Shlok 19b- 20a: Oh, great saint, on knowing the valour of those valorous ones as valueless, I countermanded 
them... oh, ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, by that you may know [the sequel of 
it...] [1-66-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: Then, oh, eminent sage, those kings beleaguered Mithila in a blind fury, since 
a self-mistrust bechanced among them all, about their own valour... [1-66-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: They surmised for themselves that they are brushed off by me, and they possessed 
by a high rancour, they strangled the City of Mithila... [1-66-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Then elapsed is an year and in anyway the possessions for livelihood went into 
a decline, oh, eminent sage, thereby I am highly anguished [1-66-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: Then I have assuaged the assemblages of gods by my ascesis and gods are also highly 
gladdened and gave me fourfold forces... [1-66-23b, 24a]

[Commentary] Comment: The four components of army are foot soldiers, cavalry, elephant-squadrons, 
and chariot-warriors.

Shlok 24b- 25a: Then those evildoers and self-mistrustful kings while being drubbed [by the heaven-sent 
army, they have become] vigourless and broken, and they beat a hasty retreat... 
[1-66-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: Oh, tigerly sage this is that supremely radiant bow, and oh, saint of sacred vows, 
I will show it, even to Rama and Lakshmana... [1-66-25b, 26a]

[Commentary] Comment: Here by the use of word 'even' 'also' Janaka is reckoning Rama or Lakshmana 
on par with other kings who have tried their hand in lifting it. As of now, Janaka 
is not admitting any supremeness or super-humanness to them. In Janaka's asking 
at verse 4 'what can I do next...' etc., Janaka has sensed as to why this Vishvamitra 
brought some boys on this long a route, that too by foot. But he is not yet self-assured 
of Rama's capability or otherwise. Hence, the next verse starts with the clause 
'if'.

Shlok 26b: "If Rama strings the bowstring of that bow, oh, sage, I will offer my daughter, 
whose birth is non-uterine, to Dasharatha's Rama..." [So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.] 
[1-66-26b, c]

[Commentary] In the endnote of Ch. 56 of Aranya Kanda, some details are given about the enigmatic 
Seetha. Here also some points about her enigmatic birth are presented.

[Commentary] Seetha is considered to be the nature's nature, Primordeal 
Nature, mahaa-prakriti, and when the five elements of nature intermingle 
into one, that is the Manifest Nature, where the five elements are
pridhvi, aapa, teja, vaayu, aakaasha 'earth, waters, 
fire, air and space...' and there are many theories of their commingling like,
panchiikaraNa, saptiikaraNa quintuplication, and sevenfold 
commingling etc. The process of creation gives rise to 24 items: 1] empirical or 
fundamental matter, 2] mahat, 3] ahamkaara, 4-8] five subtle elements, 9-13] five 
gross elements, 14] mind, 15-19] five sense organs, 20-24] five motor organs, 25] 
jiivaatma, individual's soul, 26] Brahman, The Absolute. With these, a created 
living being is created. This is in the case of mortals and their births. But when 
Seetha is found in the furrow all these things have already happened and there is 
no question of human pregnancy to be attached to her. Hence Seetha is to be taken 
as Goddess Lakshmi, who is paraa-shakti, Vishnu-Maayaa 
and when she has to take an incarnation to become the prime cause to the effect 
of eliminating Ravana, no human activity of reproduction can be attached to such 
beings. If she were to be a human, perhaps she would not have exited from the pyre 
of fire when she self-immolated, after Rama and Ravana war. Some more information, 
though unrelated to Valmiki Ramayana, is given hereunder.

[Commentary] Lakshmi evolved from the Milky Ocean, when gods and demons churned it for
amrita, the Divine Elixir, along with it a host of 
other items like, haalaahala, [cosmic poison,]
candra Moon, kalpa-vrikSha, 
[Benevolent Divine Tree,] and the medicinal sage-god Dhanvantari 
holding the golden pot of amrita, have come out as 
has been explained by Vishvamitra to Rama in this Kanda.

[Commentary] Vishnu is the all-inclusive deity, known as puruSa 
or mahaa-puruSa... parama aatma Supreme Person,
naraayaNa one who peregrinates mortals in and out this 
mortal world, antaryAmi The In-dweller of all beings, 
and He is the sheShin the Totality, in whom all souls 
are contained. He is bhagavat where
bhaga, derives from the root 
bhaj meaning Gracious Lord, and vat one who 
has it. Vishnu possesses six such divine glories SaD-guna- 
vibhuuti, namely, 1] j~naana, Omniscience 2]
aishwarya, Providence, 3] shakti, 
Omnicompetence, 4] bala, Omnipotence, 5]
viirya, Immutability. 6] tejas, 
Resplendence, shakti is the samvit, 
the Primary Intelligence of God, while the other five attributes emerge from this
samvid and hence shakti 
is the god's ahamata Personality and Activity. Thus 
this Shakti of god is personified in mythological lore and is called Shri or Lakshmi, 
and She is said to manifest herself in, 1] kriyaa-shakti, 
Creative Activity and 2] bhuuti-shakti, Creation of 
God. Hence Vishnu cannot part with His own personality or creativity i.e.,
ahamta, which in its feminine form is called
shrii or Lakshmi. He therefore 
needs His consort Goddess Lakshmi to be with Him always, untouched by any. Thus, 
Goddess Lakshmi has to accompany Vishnu in all His incarnations, along with other 
paraphernalia like his conch-shell, his quoit and mace, and the thousand headed 
serpent aadisheSa etc. Such a delightful deity Goddess 
Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, but she is fickle 
like ripples lakShmii hi toyatarangacapalaa Lakshmi= Goddess Lakshmi; 
hi= indeed; toya= water; taranga= wave like; capalaa= wavering. 'Goddess Lakshmi 
is wavering like the waves of water...' chapala, chanchala, 
asthira, wavering, faltering, unstable, and maayaa, 
maa + yaa 'whose illusory play she is, or liilaa 
play of god. She comes in unnoticeably like the water in a coconut and evaporates 
innocently into thin air, at Her will. Such as she is she is easily grabbed by the 
greedy. Hence none can give birth to her except the Mother Nature, and hence she 
is called mahilaa ; mahi + laa where
mahi is earth and laa ; laH khaNDane 
triSu aadaane stri because Mother Earth gave birth to Seetha, Seetha is
mahilaa Hence it is better to avoid assuming her to 
be an ordinary lady of an ordinary birth, and she may be viewed either legendarily 
or mythologically, for Valmiki as an epical poet, himself has not chronicled the 
details of her birth.

[Commentary] Even Vishnu is deprived of Her in His incarnations, not only in Ramayana but also 
in His nR^isimha Man-Lion incarnation. There, Maya 
Lakshmi becomes a tribal woman to bring back the ferocious Lion-Man to his original 
form. And in other versions of Ramayana, it is said that Ravana abducted Maya Seetha, 
but not real Seetha. 'When the real Seetha herself is an enigma, what if Ravana 
abducts real or duplicate copy of that Seetha...' is the brushed aside adjustment. 
In either case, it is maayaa, liilaa illusory power, sport 
of Vishnu together with that of Goddess Lakshmi, cause this enigma. Hence, whenever 
She is thus absconding from Him, Vishnu searches and retrieves Her, for no one in 
Universe can handle her, nor amass all the wealth. The predestined wealth alone 
is enjoyable but nothing more can be amassed. So also are the riches in the present 
day world, come too suddenly and vanish that suddenly. No one is rich ever and anon, 
and on someday every one is likely to see the ups and downs in his graph of riches. 
It is Vishnu that retrives the real wealth back to His abode
VaikunTha, and even punishes anyone for his accumulation 
of beyond-the-means-wealth. The burning of Lanka by Hanuma in Sundara Kanda is an 
example to this.

[Commentary] In Lakshmi-tantra , a Vaishnavaite 
aagama text, She that unrestrainable Goddess Lakshmi declares Herself, as
naaraayaNii, vaiSNavii i.e., a coequal of Vishnu, in 
the play of the universe i.e., in God's liilaa, saying 
that: aham naaraayaNii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa 'I am indeed
naaraayaNii i.e. Lakshmi, the Supreme Essence of Vishnu... 
[Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.]

[Commentary] The Hindu mythology bases more on its eighteen Puraana-s, each of the six is rendered 
to each of the Hindu Trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. A]
Vishnu Puraana-s are: - 1] Vishnu, 
2] bhaagavata, 3] naaradiiya, 4] garuda, 5] padma. 6] varaaha. B]
Brahma Puraana-s : -1] Brahma, 
2] brahmaanda, 3] brahmavaivarta, 4] maarkandeya, 5] bhaviSya,6] vaamana. 
C] Shiva Puraana-s : - 1] vaayu, 
2] linga, 3] skanda, 4] agni, 5] matsya, 6] kuurma. In all these Puraana-s 
Goddess Lakshmi is given a laudable place without any sectarian dispute. In the 
Vaishnavaite Puraana-s, Shiva starts telling the efficacy of Vishnu to Goddess Parvati. 
While Shaiva mythology places Goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva, in one half 
of Shiva's body ardhanaariishvara-tattva, and Vaishnavaite 
tradition places Goddess Lakshmi in the heart of Vishnu itself, as if it is a Lotus
hridayakamala. This is to depict the inseparable unison 
of Universal puruSa, Male and
prakriti , Female, the seed and field.

[Commentary] While Valmiki Ramayana names Rama as Rama, the Padma Puraana etc., mythological 
texts bring in the Vedic texts and prefix shrii of
shrii-suukta of Rig Veda khila 5-87, which is a feminine 
counterpart of puruSa-suukta of Rig Veda 10-90, for
paramapuruSa i.e., Vishnu or Narayana, and thus call 
Rama of Valmiki as shrii raama. Vaishnavaite mythologies 
take hold of these and other Vedic references to Vishnu, and treat Vishnu / Narayana 
and Lakshmi as the inseparable divine couple, who maintain this Universe. The prefix
shrii means as 'one who takes delight in
shrii i.e., Lakshmi, meaning wealth, wealth of any 
kind. shriiriti prathamam naama lakshmyaaH  and ' if
a is the first name of Vishnu,
shrii is the first name of Lakshmi. Thus, primarily 
eight kinds of wealth are established, to be associated with Goddess Lakshmi. They 
are 1] aadi Lakshmi Wealth a priori 2]
dhaanya Lakshmi Cereal Wealth 3]
Dhairya Lakshmi Wealth of Courage 4]
gaja Laksmi Elephant Wealth, i.e., Elephantine Wealth 
of all animals and livestock, santaana Lakshmi Wealth 
of Progeny, 6] vijaya Lakshmi, Wealth of Victory, 7]
vidyaa Lakshmi Wealth of Education, 8]
dhana Lakshmi Monetary Wealth. And any thing that need 
be affluent gets the auspicious prefix shrii or suffix
lakshmi, and called raajya Lakshmi 
, Wealth of Empire, bhaagya lakshmi Wealth of Fortune, 
and the like...

[Commentary] The play of Goddess Lakshmi in the form of Seetha is Ramayana. As such, her absence 
from Rama caused Rama to travel up to Lanka, annihilate the evil, and retrieve her. 
Seetha herself expresses her anguish about Rama's indulgence in a Supreme welfare-state, 
than in herself, as Mahaakavi Kalidasa, in his epical poem Raghu Vamsha, and depicts 
what this bhaagya lakshmi has to say, when Rama, basing 
on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject, deserts Seetha in favour of
raajya lakshmi when Seetha said as below:

[Commentary] "Earlier you refused the kingdom-wealth, raajya lakshmi 
and came to forests, where I was with you. Now that, that kingdom-wealth,
raajya lakshmi on winning your affection is jealous 
of me, who am your bhaagya lakshmi 'fortune-wealth...' 
and she does not let me live in your palace." And thus, Seetha departs Rama to forests, 
at the fag end of Ramayana.

[Commentary] Valmiki declares Ramayana is siithaayaaH charitam mahaan... 
'Seetha's impeccable conduct...' by giving her an unusual birth from the furrow 
of the plough, and in the end she exits from this world into the same soil, where 
the earth is called vasundharaa, which cleaves under 
Seetha's feet, and takes Seetha into her womb again. As such, the reason for Seetha 
to be there in that furrow as baby is said to be a vow of Goddess Lakshmi, in her 
earlier incarnation as Vedavati. The mythologies go on to say that Vedavati is the 
brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati in marriage 
none less than Vishnu. But in his lifetime, it is an unfulfilled desire. Then Vedavati 
starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father's wish. When she is at her culmination 
point of her penance, Ravana, passing that way in sky sees this beautiful lady, 
nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation, curses Ravana 
saying that she will reincarnate herself, to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. 
Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. And Vedavati is reborn 
as Seetha of Ramayana, in an unusual way.

[Commentary] Here aananda-raamaayaNa has an interesting parable. 
Once there was a king named Padmaaksha who wanted Lakshmi as his daughter. On practising 
ascesis Vishnu appears and gives a fruit called maatulunga 
phala, and girl emerges from out of that fruit, and she is named as
Padma. But greedy to possess her, all the wooing kings 
war with Padmaaksha and his entire family is ruined and Padma jumps into fire and 
self immolates herself. Later when Vishnu's maayaa comes 
out of an altar of fire, sits in her meditation, Ravana sees her and wants to abduct 
her. Of course, she is otherwise said to be Vedavati in other texts. But again, 
she enters the fire altar and reduces herself to ashes. Even then, Ravana searches 
in those ashes for her. In there, he gets five diamonds of high quality. He comes 
to Lanka and paces those diamonds in a casket and jovially presents them to his 
wife Mandodari. When Mandodari could not lift the casket Ravana lifts it and opens 
its lid, as he lifted Mt. Kailash. When the casket is opened, Mandodari finds a 
baby girl in it and recognises her to be Goddess Lakshmi. Then they consult their 
teachers about that baby's arrival. Those teachers wishing good for Ravana, advise 
to get rid off this girl immediately, for he is Goddess Lakshmi, arrived here only 
to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders his servants to carry away 
this baby in a casket by an aircraft and get rid off it.

[Commentary] But Ravana rushes after the girl with a sword, to put that girl to sword. Empress 
Mandodari pacifies Ravana and says "Why purchase a later time death now itself at 
the hand of this baby... let that the casket be buried..." Ravana agrees. Mandodari 
also curses this girl saying, "this faithless girl, [for wealth 
is unfaithful,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses 
conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though 
wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole 
of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude..." Thus 
this casket is buried in the fields of King Janaka's empire by demons, clandestinely. 
Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal 
world, to foster this buried girl, and thus presumed her curse to be twisty. But 
there is King Janaka with all the above attributes. A king without ego, wealthy 
but living simple, childless, yet does not crave for one, like King Dasharatha. 
Hence, he is called raajarSi a saintly king. Seetha's 
birth is to be limitedly understood, as said by Janaka in this chapter. Otherwise, 
the nuances about the birth of Seetha are to be viewed through the viewfinders of 
mythologies, legends, and above all, through the viewfinders of tradition... but 
not in the vast of epical poetry, as Valmiki himself has undocumented it...



SARGA 67
------------------------------

[Text] Rama breaks Shiva's bow when he wanted to examine the tautness of its
          bowstring. Janaka is perplexed, while others swooned at the blast of breaking bow, and
          Janaka proposes Seetha to Rama in marriage. On the approval of Vishvamitra to that
          proposal, Janaka sends his plenipotentiaries to Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: On listening to the words of Janaka, the eminent-saint Vishvamitra indeed said to
  the king Janaka thus as, "let the bow be displayed to Rama..." [1-67-1]

Shlok 2: Then king Janaka indeed ordered his ministers, "bring the divine bow which is
  decorated with sandalwood paste and garlands... [1-67-2]

Shlok 3- 4: Thus clearly instructed by Janaka those high souled ministers have gone out from
  there and entered the palace-chambers, and they came out with an eight-wheeled coffer in which
  the bow of Shiva is ensconced, and those ministers got it tugged by five thousand tall men of
  illimitable energy who somehow tugged it very difficultly, and thus the ministers have re-entered
  there keeping that bow afore of them. [1-67-3, 4]

Shlok 5: On fetching that iron coffer wherein that bow is there, those ministers of the
  king have reported to their godlike King Janaka. [1-67-5]

Shlok 6: Oh king and sovereign of Mithila, here is the select bow that is reverenced by
  all kings, oh, best king, which you wished to be evincible to the boys, to evince their
  capabilities... [1-67-6]

Shlok 7: On listening the announcement of his ministers the king spoke to the noble souled
  Vishvamitra and to both Rama and Lakshmana too duly making palm-fold. [1-67-7]

Shlok 8: Here is that exquisite bow, oh, Brahman, which is held as a time-honoured bow by
  the lineage of Janaka kings, and with which even the highly forceful kings are rendered
  inefficient to take aim with it, previously... [1-67-8]

Shlok 9- 10: None in all the assemblages of gods, inclusive of demigods, demons, gandharva-s,
  yaksha-s, kinnaraa-s, or reptilian demigods, is capable enough to take aim with this bow and all
  are rendered incapable... and then, in brandishing this bow for a proper grip, or in bracing its
  bowstring to the other end, or in twitching the bowstring for its tautness, or in placing the
  arrow on bowstring at a proper place for a proper stretchability, or even in taking a good aim
  with it... what will be that capability of one from among humans... [1-1-9, 10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, eminent-saint, such as it is, this nonpareil bow among all bows is brought
  in, and oh, highly fortunate sage Vishvamitra, let this be displayed to those two princes..."
  Thus Janaka said to Vishvamitra. [1-67-11]

Shlok 12: Vishvamitra on listening the sentence of Janaka along with Rama, on his part said
  to Raghava, "oh, boy Rama... you may see the bow..." [1-67-12]

Shlok 13: Upon the word of the great sage Vishvamitra, Rama on unclosing the lid of that
  strongbox, wherein that bow is ensconced, saw the bow and said. [1-67-13]

Shlok 14: Now I wish to get the feel of this supreme bow, oh, Brahman, and I shall try to
  brandish it, or even try to take aim with it... [1-67-14]

Shlok 15: "All Right!" said the saint and king to Rama in chorus, and Rama upon the word of
  the sage grasping it at the middle handgrip playfully grabbed the bow. [1-67-15]

Shlok 16: While many thousands of men are witnessing that right-minded Rama the legatee of
  Raghu stringed the bow effortlessly. [1-67-16]

[Commentary] A bow has a definite height and it is a measure of length, from the ages even
  up to the age Kautilya, who gave many accounts for weights and measures, in his 'Artha Shaastra'
  a Penguin re-publication. Four aratni-s cubits are one dhanu, a bow-length,
  where one aratni is 18 inches, thus a bow-length is 6 feet and above, taking the
  standard size of archer as a six-footer and a little above. The bow's height is the height of the
  archer plus one measure of his head's height, as the upper end has to tower the archer's head.
  That being so, this bow belongs to Shiva and its height must be placed more than the human
  measure of 6 feet, and then it must be some 8 to 10 feet. And 'Rama is no crane-legged boy, as
  hisphysique is said to be of 'medium' size, and then how a boy of, say of 4, 41/2 feet, could
  catch the upper end of 8-10 feet bow to bend it...' is the objection. An archer has to stand the
  bow on ground, clutch its lower end under big toe, and with one hand, he has to bend it, while
  with the other he catches the bowstring to string the other end. He is not supposed to handle it
  like a holdall or a briefcase. For this objection it is said in a way that the poet is using the
  adjective mahaatmaa to Rama, ' an unfathomable one with an equally unfathomable soul...
  inasmuch as his duty is concerned...' The minute he touched the bow, it became a spongy stick and
  it listened to him and bent as he wished. Other way round, Rama is an ambidextrous archer and
  furthered is his skill by his possession of some divine missiles as given by Vishvamitra. Hence,
  his dexterity is now multiplied and he can handle any divine or human bow 'effortlessly...'

Shlok 17: Further, that dextrous one has stringed that bow with bowstring and started to
  stretch it up to his ear to examine its tautness, but that glorious one who is foremost among
  men, Rama, broke that bow medially. [1-67-17]

[Commentary] The bow is not broken by itself because of its oldness or dryness, but let us
  blame Rama for breaking it, as with any other toy which children are apt to damage in their
  playing. He stretched the bowstring so long until it broke. Neither his mother nor father
  available here. Otherwise, a 'moral class' would have chanced on him for braking articles in
  neighbour's houses. The bow is broken in the middle, not at either end, but at handgrip. This
  shows the strength of his palm on handgrip.

Shlok 18: Then there bechanced an explosive explosion when the bow is broken, like the
  explosiveness of down plunging thunder, and the earth is tremulously tremulous, as it happens
  when a mountain is exploding. [1-67-18]

[Commentary] We can write more words for the above sound as, 'Dhaam, Dhiim, Phut, and
  DiSkuu...' etc., as long as thesaurus permit. But all that will be nonsensical. An ear-splitting
  sound has come but it is "OM" the auspicious sonus prima grata, produced once upon a time by
  Shiva's drum, in order to emanate words through maaheshvara-suutraaNi, which were
  unintelligible even for the sages like Sanaka, Sananda, Sanat Kumaara et al., and which were
  deciphered by Nandi, the Holy Bull vehicle of Shiva, to those sages. Here it is Shiva's bow and
  name of Shiva and all letters that attaches to Him are shaM, sha.nkara, shaMbhava, are
  peace-making letters, as codified in AUM namaH
  shambhave ca mayo bhave ca namaH sha~Nkaraaya ca mayaskaraaya ca namaH shivaaya ca shivataraaya
  ca | - rudram - soma suukta - yajur  Hence the real sound of Om is
  audible and it is ear-splitting for ordinary audience, since ordinary people cannot possibly face
  realities, and it is a regularly audible sound for the other four who have not swooned. By the
  way, it will be impossible for us to listen the chanting of Veda-s, even in these days, in any
  Vedic school for at least half an hour, as our ears are untuned to their ghana paaTha or
  jaTa or other sorts of chanting. We feel stranded in some audio studio with fully loaded
  sound FX.

[Commentary] And the pacemaker Rama lifted the bow of the peacemaker Shiva, where the bow
  itself is "Om". The legendary Indian bow is composed of three parts, unlike Robin Hood's
  single-piece bow. The lower bowing part, upper bowing part combined by a grip handle, and the
  bowstring. The three pieces are comparable to the three letters syllabified "Om" - a u
  ma, where a is upper bowing piece of bow, u, the lower end, and
  ma, the bowstring. The painters usually paint this bow-breaking scene, where Rama will
  be still handling the upper end in his hand, while the lower part will be falling, and the
  bowstring will be still dangling onto the upper end. The upper part of bow is a and this
  a is Vishnu akaaraartho viSNuH, and the dangling bowstring is ma
  Goddess Lakshmi, lokamaataa maa ramaa mangaladevataa, dangling on the Supreme Person
  through thick and thin, and the detached-un-detached lower end is u, Lakshmana, or any
  other adherer. A lengthy account of this trilogy is provided in Aranya Kanda, Ch. 19, first
  verse.

[Commentary] And the pacemaker Rama is marrying the world with peace, by stringing the
  bowstring of peacemaker's bow, and it is not a mere marriage of some prince charming, with a
  charmy princess. Thus, this sound is the initial impact, impetus, brunt, or whatever, for
  universal peace, and that way this marriage attains a legendary significance in peace process,
  though by force.

Shlok 19: Bewildered by that raucous caused by the breakage of bow, all the people swooned,
  except for that eminent-saint Vishvamitra, king Janaka, and those two Raghava-s, namely Rama and
  Lakshmana. [1-67-19]

Shlok 20: While the people are being reaccustomed after their undergoing the shock, at that
  moment that sententious king Janaka, whose discomfiture has completely departed by now has said
  this to the eminent-saint Vishvamitra with a reverent palm-fold. [1-67-20]

Shlok 21: Oh, godly sage, the gallantry of Dasharatha's Rama is evidently seen... and the
  whys of this boy and wherefores of his stringing that massive bow are unimaginable to me! More
  so, humans lifting it! How so? This is an unhoped-for incident for me, besides, breaking it! This
  a is highly wondrous experience for me... [1-67-21]

Shlok 22: My daughter Seetha on getting Dasharatha's Rama as her husband, she will bring
  celebrity to the lineage of Janaka-s... [1-67-22]

[Commentary] This verse explains the advantageous status of Seetha than Rama in her birth
  and brought up. mama sutaa 'my daughter...' though I have not given her a physical
  birth, she is godsend to me, and I brought her up as a rarest of rare daughter with all the
  endowments of Janaka-s lineage which are impeccable... hence she is more than my physical
  daughter...' siitaa 'a furrow... born a furrow, an unusual non-uterine birth than the
  uterine birth of Rama from his mother Kausalya... hence Seetha has a plus point... dasharathaatmajam
   'Dasharatha's son...' a wooable bridegroom... because he is Rama ramayate iti
  raama 'makes others delightful...' besides this, the saying about an eligible bridegroom is
  there:  kanyaa varayate
  ruupam maataa vittam pitaa shrutam baandhavaaH shiilam icchanti suupaannam itare
  janaaH   'a bride cherishes charming mien, a prince-charming, rather... mother
  of the bridegroom wishes to have money through him... bridegroom's father wants him to be a wise one
  in dealings with his new wife and old parents... and bridegroom's relatives require of him good
  demeanour... and other people wish to have dough of cooked pulse-gram, marriage-feasts,
  rather...' so also my daughter will cherish this boy as his looks are like that of a
  prince-charming... and the money for his mother, scholarly attitude to his father, good demeanour
  and feasts etc., to friends and relatives, all he can afford... and on aasaadya reaching
  Rama... my daughter brings kiirti 'celebrity' to our lineage, which is in singularly
  unique... because kiirti is said in singular number, it will be singularly unique...
  hence let this boy not negate my proposal as my daughter has many plus points...'

Shlok 23: Oh, Kaushika, my commitment that she is the bounty of bravery has also come
  true... and my daughter Seetha who is nurtured well than my own lives is a worthy bride for
  Rama... [1-67-23]

Shlok 24: Should you give consent, oh, Brahman, my ministers will be hastened to speedily
  go to Ayodhya in chariots, oh, Kaushika, let safeness betide you, and one and all by this
  matrimony... [1-67-24]

[Commentary] Annex: 'This boy appears to be straight from the shoulder type, and he may now
  say boyishly, 'no, no, I just wanted to see and feel the bow, but that poor old bow is broken in
  my hand, but I have never said that I will marry your daughter without the consent of my
  father... and I am supposed to marry whomever my father ties down my neck...' knowing him to be
  such, I want to send proposals to Dasharatha at Ayodhya, that too if you say yes...'

Shlok 25: With their observant submissions those ministers will narrate in detail about the
  sincere endowment of Seetha as bravery's bounty to Rama, and they will lead king Dasharatha into
  my city that observantly... [1-67-25]

Shlok 26: "Those ministers will also tell the king Dasharatha that both the Kakutstha-s,
  Rama and Lakshmana, are under the aegis of saint Vishvamitra, and thus gladdening that king they
  will expeditiously usher in king Dasharatha for marriage..." So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.
  [1-67-26]

Shlok 27: Vishvamitra said, "so be it," and then that right-minded king Janaka on consulting
  with his ministers started to send his ministers, plenipotentiaries, to Ayodhya to inform
  Dasharatha in detail as to what has happened, and likewise to bring him to Mithila. [1-67-27]



SARGA 68
------------------------------

[Text] Janaka's delegation arrives at Ayodhya and submits its message to Dasharatha. Listening 
to the tidings that his son Rama not only lifted the bow of Shiva, but broke it 
as well, Dasharatha is overjoyed and refers the matter of marriage of Seetha with 
Rama to his ministers and teachers. All of the ministers and sages unanimously agree 
to that proposal and they are set to travel to Mithila the next day.

Shlok 1: Those envoys who are clearly ordered by Janaka entered the city of Ayodhya on sojourning 
for three nights en route, and whose horses are overtired for they are galloped 
so fast to loose no time. [1-68-1]

Shlok 2: On going to the palace those envoys are given an audience with the consent of Dasharatha, 
and when they are conducted into the palace-chambers they have seen the elderly 
king Dasharatha gleaming like a god. [1-68-2]

Shlok 3: Completely gone is the angst of all the legates on seeing godly Dasharatha, and 
all of them adjoing palms in reverence said this compliant and mellowly worded sentence 
to the king. [1-68-3]

[Commentary] Because Dasharatha is caught in the tomfoolery of Kaikeyi he cannot be estimated 
as an inane personality. It is their domestic cold war. He is famous for his achievements 
and he fought wars on behalf of no lesser gods. Though Valmiki does not narrate 
Dasharatha's exploits, other scripts say a lot about them. Hence, whenever Rama's 
daring, dashing, swashbuckling is to be pictured, he will be indicated as 'Dasharatha's 
son...' That is the reason why the angst of envoys is said in this verse as 'vanished' 
just by a glimpse of that godly personality, which hitherto haunted them as to how 
to countenance such a powerful personality.

Shlok 4- 5: Oh, exalted emperor Dasharatha! Janaka, the lineal king of Janaka-s and the present 
sovereign of Mithila is asking time and time again with mellowly words instilled 
with friendliness, after the wellbeing and after the unmitigated prosperity of your 
highness, along with that of your highness' priests and teachers, also that of your 
highness' subjects, who always precede your highness in convoys in any event, as 
your highness are the one who ingratiates himself with the Ritual-fires, ever and 
anon... [1-68-4, 5]

Shlok 6: His highness Janaka of Videha, and the sovereign of Mithila, having asked after 
your highness' wellbeing is sensibly saying this word to your highness, with the 
indorse of Kaushika... [1-68-6]

Shlok 7: Well-known is the solemn promise of mine that my daughter Seetha is a bounty 
for bravery... also well-know is that the kings who came to lift the bow turned 
out as gutless kings, and then they turned out as rancorous kings at me, and it 
is also well-known that I turned them back with my guts... [1-68-7]

Shlok 8: Oh, Emperor Dasharatha, your young and valorous son who serendipitously arrived 
at Mithila along with his younger brother Lakshmana, keeping Vishvamitra at his 
fore, finally carries off this girl, the well-known daughter of mine... [1-68-8]

[Commentary] Usually this verse gives meaning that 'two of your valorous sons won Seetha...' 
because of the usage of plural number viiraiH putrakaiH But this is counted 
as 'royal we' sort of expression to honour Rama. Hence this ka-pratyaya, 
though used in the verse, will be read as singular. There is another shade of wording 
for this verse: seyam mama sutaa raajan vishvaamitrasya shaashanaat | puriim imaam samaagatya 
tava pureNa nirjitaa || which uses only singular for Rama.

Shlok 9: Also, oh, highly dextrous king Dasharatha, noble souled Rama wrecked that divine 
bow, which is a gem of a bow among bows, at its central point before a grand assembly 
of people... [1-68-9]

Shlok 10: Seetha is the bounty for bravery and I shall have to afford her to the noble-souled 
Rama, as such it will be apt of you to give your consent as I wish to keep up my 
solemn promise... [1-68-10]

Shlok 11: Keeping your royal priest Vashishta and other teachers ahead of you, oh, great 
emperor, I wish you to come apace, let safe betide you, for it will be apt of you 
to take a look at your ennobled son Rama, and Lakshmana, too... [1-68-11]

Shlok 12: 'It will be apt of you to make my solemn promise maintainable, and that way you 
will derive delight on seeing both of your sons...' [1-68-12]

[Commentary] 'by the by, you will also derive delight in seeing Seetha, for she is also a hyphenated 
daughter of yours, sutashcha sutaa ca tayoH ekasheSaH... with another suffix, 
in-law...'

Shlok 13: "Thus the sovereign of Videha kingdom said these endearing words, abiding by the 
counsel of Sage Shataananda, and Sage Vishvamitra is also consentient to the proposal..." 
Thus the envoys conveyed the proposal and paused. [1-68-13]

Shlok 14: King Dasharatha is highly gladdened on hearing that message from the delegates, 
and said this way to Vashishta, Vaamadeva, and to his other ministers, as well. 
[1-68-14]

Shlok 15: This one Rama, the enhancer of Kausalya's rejoice, is stopping over at Videha kingdom 
along with his brother Lakshmana, and Vishvamitra is taking care of both these boys... 
[1-68-15]

Shlok 16: On observing the valour of Kakutstha Rama, noble souled Janaka wishes to gift his 
daughter as bride to Raghava Rama... [1-68-16]

Shlok 17: "If you all favour the tidings from the noble-souled Janaka as to what has happened 
in Mithila, we quickly proceed to that city, let not the time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha 
informed his counsel. [1-68-17]

[Commentary] The word vR^ittam 'happening' 'history' and it is generally translated 
as 'the history, legend, and the familial characteristics of Janaka...' But when 
Janaka already is famous through the bow of Shiva, and that bow itself is broken 
now, no more 'verification of antecedents' of Janaka is needed, and it is 'what 
has happened now' i.e., the impossible deed of breaking it.

Shlok 18: The ministers along with all of the great sages said in consonance, "Most Welcome..." 
and then that highly pleased king Dasharatha said to the ministers, "we travel tomorrow..." 
[1-68-18]

Shlok 19: The ministers of king Janaka who are gifted with all talents are given grateful 
hospitality by Dasharatha, and they all dwelt that night in Ayodhya, overjoyed at 
the successful completion of their august legatine, called 
sIta kalyANam...  [1-68-19]



SARGA 69
------------------------------

[Text] Dasharatha arrives at Mithila and Janaka receives him reverentially, as he belongs 
to a crowning dynasty, called Ikshvaku-s. Then, after the usual exchange of royal 
pleasantries and protocol, all of them stay in Mithila comfortably.

Shlok 1: On the next dawn that heartened king Dasharatha who is with his teachers and his 
relatives then said this to his minister Sumantra. [1-69-1]

Shlok 2: Now let the chancellors of exchequers draw ample riches, gems and numerous other 
items that are used in the marriage from bridegroom's side, all-inclusively, and 
let them travel in advance and let them be well-prepared for any exigency... [1-69-2]

Shlok 3: Let the quadruple forces start off in a trice from everywhere at my order, and 
others shall start with unexcelled vehicles like palanquins, sedan chairs, litters 
etc., and with those that can be yoked with horses, like cabined-coaches and horse-carriages... 
[1-69-3]

[Commentary] The fourfold army is generally taken as horses, elephants, chariots, and foot 
soldiers for the word caturanga-balam , while some say such an army is 
moved only when a massive combat is necessary, but not when going to marriages. 
Thus some say though army is moved, it is as much as required. But this word also 
qualifies as caturanga-balam= dhana, kanaka, vastu, vaahana sampatti, the 
quadruple opulence, namely 'riches, gold, equipage, and vehicles...' where opulence 
will be the only show in Indian marriages, either of poor or rich. R. C. Dutt comes 
near to this when telling in his poetic version: 'Ride in front with royal riches, 
gold and gems in bright array

Shlok 4- 5: "Vashishta, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali and Kaashyapa, and the long-lived Maarkandeya, and 
Sage Kaatyaayana... let these Brahmans travel in forefront... and let horses be 
yoked to my royal-cariole, and as the messengers of Janaka are hastening me arrange 
for the travel without time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha ordered. [1-69-4, 5]

Shlok 6: On the word of that best king the fourfold opulence, and even the fourfold forces 
up to some extent followed rearward of the king who is going after the sages who 
are going afore of him. [1-69-6]

Shlok 7: Travelling on a four-day-route Dasharatha reached the fringes of Videha kingdom, 
and on hearing this, the illustrious king Janaka arranged for welcome ceremonies 
at the outskirts of the city. [1-69-7]

[Commentary] These formalities are still prevalent in marriage functions, in one way or the other, 
in India, esp. rural India. The bridegroom's party will be received at the outskirts 
of the bride's place, esp. if it were to be a village, then a small function / ceremony 
will be held laudatory to the bridegroom, and then they are invited into that place 
of bride like, 'meet a party halfway...' type protocol. This is other than baraat 
'matrimonial pageantry...'

Shlok 8: Then the king Janaka who is by far gladdened went into a state of ecstatic elation 
when he met the senescent king and paladin of people, namely Dasharatha, as the 
pace for the marriage celebrations is quickened because of the immediate arrival 
of Dasharatha. [1-69-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: And the best one among men, king Janaka, gleefully said this commendable sentence 
to Dasharatha, the best legatee of Raghu, "oh, king, a hearty welcome to you. Oh, 
legatee of Raghu, your arrival to my city is just by my providence... you will now 
get delectation on seeing your sons who won accolades just by their valorousness 
in the act of raising and breaking Shiva's bow..." [1-69-9, 10a]

[Commentary] Though Rama alone broke the bow of Shiva, both Rama and Lakshmana are said to have 
done it. This is a common unified laudation used for both of them, in view of their 
insuperable brotherhood, and such a sort of commingling both, for one person's action, 
can be heard often. For e.g., when Lakshmana misshapes Shuurpanakha, Rama is said 
to have done, and even both are said to have done that act.

Shlok 10b- 11a: Providentially bechanced is the arrival of this great-resplendent and godly sage 
Vashishta, who arrived here with all of these eminent Brahmans, like Indra himself 
with all gods... [1-69-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: Providentially my hindrances are overcome by the arrival of godlike sages, and 
providentially my lineage too is gloried owing to this hymeneal engagement with 
noble-souled Raghava-s, who are the most valorous among all the valorous people... 
[1-69-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13b: Because you are born in first and foremost Ikshvaku dynasty, hence you are the 
Indra of Indra-like kings on earth... and hence, it will be apt of you to initiate 
the celebrations of marriage tomorrow, and the marriage itself after the culmination 
of the Vedic-ritual in three or four days, and the date and time for the marriage, 
that which is agreeable to the best sages can be decided, and you can get it performed 
on that date, through those great sages... [1-69-12b, 13a]

[Commentary] There is controversy about the marriage of Seetha with Rama, insofar as its categorisation. 
Whether it is one of the eight kinds or not, is a debated point. The eight kinds 
of marriages are braahma, daiva, praajaapatya, aarSa, aasura, gaandharva, raakshasa, 
paishaaca and this topic can be discussed at a later time.

Shlok 13b- 14a: On hearing that sentence of king Janaka the sententious king Dasharatha replied 
the king Janaka from amongst the sages. [1-69-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Recipiency rests with the restitutor..." so I have heard earlier. Hence, whatever 
you say, for you are the knower of probity and nothing goes amiss in your astute 
thinking, that we will do... [1-69-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] The word restitutor is used instead of 'donor' because Janaka is restoring the estranged 
divine pair to their togetherness in this mortal world. R. C. Dutt uses 'Gift betokens 
giver's bounty...' for this expression.

Shlok 15b- 16a: On listening that sentence of that affirmer of principles, namely Dasharatha, that 
which is conformable to the principles of marriages and familial glory, a thrill 
of joy came over the king of Videha. [1-69-15b. 16a]

[Commentary] Usually the bridegroom's party will be stiff-necked at least till the marriage is 
over, which has become a nuisance practice in Indian marriages. Here Dasharatha 
is telling the opposite, by which his words are viewed as agreeable to righteousness 
of marriages etc., and for which Janaka is surprised.

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then, on the foregathering of sages from Vashishta's side with the sages of Mithila 
all the sages have attained extreme joy and they spent that night happily. [1-69-16b, 
17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Then that most brilliant Rama, keeping Vishvamitra ahead, and strutting in step 
with Lakshmana, strutted to touch the feet of his father Dasharatha. [1-69-17]

Shlok 18b-19a: On seeing his two sons, the super medallists in Raghu's dynasty, King Dasharatha 
is highly rejoiced and he resided in Mithila with a high contentment, for the reverence 
of Janaka is that high. [1-69-18]

[Commentary] The expression of 'medallists' to the word Raghava-s as above will look 
odd. So an explanation to this is furnished in the endnote.

Shlok 19: Even the great-resplendent Janaka on performing ritual acts according to scriptures 
for the Vedic-ritual on hand, and the preparatory rituals for handing out both of 
his daughters in marriage, went into the sleep of the just, with his palm on his 
chest. [1-69-19]

[Commentary] The marriages will be commenced with initial ceremonies called ankuraaropaNa- 
aadi kriyaaH for an unhindered marriage function and for the harmonious family 
life of the newly wed.



SARGA 70
------------------------------

[Text] Ikshvaku's bloodline is narrated as custom demands to enquire into the bridegroom's lineage. Vashishta narrates this to 
 other Kushadhvaja, who is also summoned to participate in the wedding celebrations, and who later has to 
offer his two daughters to Bharata and Shatrughna. This listing and eulogising ancestors is an adjunctive custom in Indian 
marriages. Nowadays it is limited to cite only three preceding generations, instead of narrating from the first, since nobody 
holds his family tree, ready at hand.

Shlok 1: Then on the next day morning after getting the ritual liturgies performed through sages, he that articulator Janaka articulated 
this to sage Shataananda, the royal priest. [1-70-1]

Shlok 2- 3: My younger brother renowned thus as Kushadhvaja, a highly self-righteous one and a highly brilliant one is ruling from 
the auspicious and holy city named Saankaasya, which city is surrounded by River Ikshumati as a natural moat, in which moat 
bastions of tridents are staked all around... and my brother presides over that city as if he is sitting in the Pushpaka 
aircraft of richly-rich god Kubera, and as though supping the sugarcane juice-like waters of River Ikshumati... [1-70-2, 
3]

[Commentary] The words vaaryaa phalakaparyantaam also mean 'that city is surrounded by the plantation of citrus grapefruits 
that are famous for health keeping.

Shlok 4: "And I wish to see him, as he is the nominated benefactor of this Vedic-ritual of mine, and he too shall become a rejoicer 
in partaking the joyousness of this marriage... " So said Janaka to Shataananda. [1-70-4]

[Commentary] Kushadhvaja supplied whole lot of paraphernalia for this Vedic-ritual of Janaka from his auspicious city Saankaasya, and 
hence he is the benefactor of the ritual.

Shlok 5: That way when Janaka asseverated that enunciation in the presence of Shataananda, Shataananda in turn ordered and summoned 
envoys, and then some alacritous envoys have come, whom Janaka ordered to proceed to his brother. [1-70-5]

Shlok 6: By the order of the king those envoys who have speedy horses have travelled on to city Saankaasya speedily, to lead forth 
that tigerly man Kushadhvaja that speedily, which is as good as fetching Vishnu by order of Indra. [1-70-6]

Shlok 7: On arriving in city Saankaasya those envoys have seen king Kushadhvaja and on submitting what has happened to the king about 
Rama's breaking of Shiva's bow, and they have also submitted the point of view of Janaka regarding marriages of four daughters. 
[1-70-7]

[Commentary] The viewpoint of Janaka is to offset the problem of marriages of both the daughters of his brother Kushadhvaja. Dasharatha 
has four sons and Janaka presaged a quadruple alliance with him, where Janaka has two daughters and his brother Kushadhvaja 
has two.

Shlok 8: On hearing that event from the worthy envoys whose speed is praiseworthy, king Kushadhvaja came right away to Mithila by 
the order of king Janaka. [1-70-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: Kushadhvaja addressed himself to the insightful one and a compassionate person in the duty of an elder brother, namely Janaka, 
and on reverencing sage Shataananda firstly, next he has reverenced his fondly affectionate brother Janaka, and then he 
sat upon a majestic seat, that which is befitting to kings. [1-70-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Both the brothers of unlimited self-refulgence having assumed their high seats, they who are distinguished for their righteous 
acts have started to send Sudaamana, the distinguished minister. [1-70-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Oh, minister plenipotentiary, Sudaamana, you please proceed immediately to king Dasharatha, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s with 
illimitable resplendence, and let that invincible king Dasharatha be led hither along with his sons and along with his Vedic-celebrants..." 
Thus Janaka ordered Sudaamana, the minister. [1-70-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: Accordingly Sudaamana has gone to the visitatorial-palace of the promoter of Raghu's heritage, namely Dasharatha, and he 
said this on appearing before that king duly bowing down and hailing the king. [1-70-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b-14a: "Oh, valiant king, oh, sovereign of Ayodhya, his highness the sovereign of Mithila from the heritage of Videha kings is 
poised for seeking an audience with your highness, along with your highness' royal-priest Vashishta and other mentors..." 
The minister Sudaamana said so to Dasharatha. [1-70-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: On hearing that best minister's words, then king Dasharatha came to the place where Janaka is available, along with his 
kinsmen and the assemblages of sages. [1-70-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: That sententious king Dasharatha said this to the king from the lineage of Videha kings, Janaka, who is with his mentors, 
kinsfolk, and ministers. [1-70-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b-17a: "Oh, exalted king Janaka, you already appreciate that this godly sage Vashishta is godlike to the bloodline of Ikshvaku-s, 
and in all affairs he is our internuncio... [1-70-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19a: "Should an assent be given by Sage Vishvamitra, along with all the great sages present here, this equanimous Vashishta will 
narrate about my bloodline, lineally..." And, to the nod of Vishvamitra Dasharatha become reticent, and then the godly and 
sententious sage Vashishta who is along with his men of the cloth said these sentences to the king of Videha, namely Janaka. 
[1-70-17b, 18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20: The Unprovable emanated the timeless, changeless and perishless Brahma, and from that Being, namely Brahma, Mariichi is 
begotten, and Kaashyapa is the son of Mariichi, and the Sun is begotten from Kaashyapa, and Manu is said to be the son of 
the Sun... [1-70-19b, 20]

[Commentary] The avyakta is the 'Unmanifest' of advaita tenet. Here it an 'Unprovable' 
entity since it cannot be proved by pramaaNa-s 'source of knowledge' like
pratyakSha, anumaana, tarka, aagama... 'perception, inference, logic, scriptures...' and because 
Vishnu cannot be deduced by these sources of knowledge, Vishnu Himself becomes the avyakta. 
And from the viewpoint of mythology, Ramayana has no place for a 'featureless Absolute...' nirguNa- 
brahma of advaita, because Valmiki's initial questions to Narada include
ko guNavaan, and thus He is saguNa-brahma. Hence
avyakta or aakaasha, 'minus leeway...' all-pervading...' 
is Vishnu, the 'Unprovable'.

[Commentary] This aakaasha is the often repeated expression in Upanishad-s, telling it to be the
aatma, Absolute, abiding in each individual jiivaatma, Individual 
Soul. aakaasho hi vai naamaruupayoH nirvaahitaaH te yad antaram tad brahma tad amR^itam sa aatmaa - chaandogya - 8-14 
| ko he vaaNyatkaH praaNaat ya eSha aakaasha aanando na syaat - taittariiya - 7 anuvaaka | aakaashorarthaantaratvaadivyapadeshaat 
- 1-3-41 | daharottarebhyaH - 1-3-14 - brahma-suutra ;'who is he to be able to balance himself if this
aakaasha is not to be there...' Taittarriya; 'that which makes the names and forms is within 
you alone as your innermost inner-space, that alone is deathless...' Chaandogya; 'akaasha [is Absolute] because it is proclaimed 
to be something different etc., [from names and forms yet their revealer...]; 'the small [aakaasha] is Absolute because 
of subsequent texts [which give ample evidence of it...] Brahma-Sutra. Hence, it is Vishnu.

[Commentary] Out of the three epithets to Brahma one is 'timeless' because He continues to be in two paraartha-s, 
say 31, 10, 40, 00, 00, 00, 000 human years, without transmutation, yet He continues further. He is 'changeless' as his 
faculties or His divine being does not undergo any mutation or metamorphosis. He is 'perishless' during the above period 
and after, since Vishnu gave rise to Him. Up to here is ultramundane order of progeny and the mundane lineage is now continued.

Shlok 21: Manu is the earliest Prajaapati and Ikshvaaku is the son of Manu, and that Ikshvaaku is the first king of Ayodhya... know 
thus... [1-70-21]

Shlok 22: The son of Ikshvaaku is the legendary Kukshi, thus he is renowned, and the famous Vikukshi is the son of Kukshi... 
[1-70-22]

Shlok 23: From that most brilliant and courageous Vikukshi, Baana emerged as son, and the highly refulgent and valinat Anaranya is 
the son of Baana... [1-70-23]

Shlok 24: Pruthu is the son of Anaranya, and Trishanku is Pruthu's son, and the highly renowned Dhundumaara happened to be the son 
of Trishanku... [1-70-24]

Shlok 25: Dhundumaara begot a highly glorious and a speediest charioteer Yuvanaashva as son, and Mandhaata emerged as the son of 
Yuvanaashva... [1-70-25]

Shlok 26: Maandhaata engendered the highly noble Susandhi as son, and even Susandhi engendered two sons, namely Dhruvasandhi and 
Prasenajit... [1-70-26]

Shlok 27: From Dhruvasandhi, an illustrious one named as Bharata is begotten, and Bharata begot a highly effulgent son named as Asita... 
[1-70-27]

Shlok 28: To which Asita, kings like Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant Shashabindu-s have become adversaries and kings in 
hostility, he had to wage war with them... [1-70-28]

Shlok 29: While counterattacking those kings, Asita is dethroned in war and then he reached Himalayas along with his two wives... 
[1-70-29]

Shlok 30- 31a: Asita was with his meagre forces when he was in Himalayas, and there he drew nigh of his Time. At the time of his demise 
two of his wives were pregnant, and one of two wives gave toxic food to the co-wife for abortion... thus we heard... [1-70-30-31a]

Shlok 31b-32a: There was a saint named Cyavana, the heir of Sage Bhrigu, who in fascination with best and beautiful mountains then taking 
shelter on Himalayas. [1-70-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: One of the two wives of Asita, the lotus-petal eyed and highly fortunate one queen came there desirous of a best son, and 
reverenced the sage who is godly in his glow... [1-70-32b-33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: Another queen Kaalindi who administer food poison to her co-wife has also come to the sage, and she too reverenced him. 
That sage spoke to her who received poison from her co-wife regarding the birth of her son. [1-70-34]

[Commentary] There are variations in reading these lines. While some say that Kaalindi is one who 'gave' toxic food to her sister, while 
some others say that Kaalindi is the one who 'received' the poisoned food. Here taking the kaalindi ca 'Kaalindi 
also...' it is said that 'Kaalindi is she who has administered poison...' Since she is also pregnant, coupled with the guilt 
of poisoning, hence the use of ca , she too came to the sage.

Shlok 34b- 35: 'Oh, highly fortunate lady, a very good son and a very mighty son is there in your womb. Soon you will give birth to a 
highly vigorous, highly refulgent son and that illustrious one will take birth with toxicity, but there is no need to worry...' 
So said Sage Cyavana to the queen of Asita who received the poison. [1-70-35]

Shlok 36: On reverencing Sage Cyavana that husband devout princess whose husband is no more that lady gave birth to a son... [1-70-36]

Shlok 37: "Because he took birth along with the poison administered to his mother by her co-wife, he became Sagara, the emperor..." 
[1-70-37]

[Commentary] Parable: When king Asita passed away his queen and this Sagara's mother wanted to commit self-immolation, but this Sage 
Cyavana dissuades her from it because she is pregnant, and takes her to his hermitage. When she gave birth to Sagara, Sage 
Cyavana rears up Sagara and teaches him all of the archery by according aagneyaastra Fire-missile etc., kingcraft, 
and scriptures. On one occasion when Sagara asks for the details about his father, Cyavana had to tell all the legend of 
Asita and his conflicts with yavana-s, and shaka-s. Sagara becoming furious at Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant 
Shashabindu-s, wars with them and drives them out of this country. While doing so, Sagara makes yavana-s tonsured,
shaka-s or so-called Scythians, as half-tonsured, and paarada-s as shaggy haired ones, thus stripping 
of their Kshatriya-hood. Taking the nearness of name paarada to Persia, it is said that the kings repulsed by Sagara 
taken domicile in the Middle East and a aaryan or a aa riaan is Airan or present day Iran, and 
age-old are Indo-Iranian links. Further, the word Asia has its own nearness to the name of king Asita.

Shlok 38: From Sagara it is Asamanja and from Asamanja it is Amshuman, and from Amshuman it is Diliipa, and the son of Diliipa is 
Bhageeratha... [1-70-38]

Shlok 39- 40a: From Bhageeratha it is Kakutstha, from Kakutstha it is Raghu, and Raghu's son is the great resplendent Pravriddha, who 
is reduced to a human flesh eater, and he is also known as Kalmaashapaada... and from him, that Pravriddha, Shankana is born... 
[1-70-39, 40a]

[Commentary] This Pravriddha is really a great king in this lineage, but somewhat arrogant. So, at one time he was subjected to the fury 
of Vashishta and becomes a man-eating demon. But he too got his mystic powers. When he was trying to issue a counter-curse 
to Vashishta, by taking water into his hand, his wife Madayanti, being a husband devout wife dissuades him to not to counter 
all-powerful Vashishta. He on listening to his wife drops that water taken for cursing, onto his own feet. Then his accursed 
water blemished him via his feet. Hence, he is also termed as Kalmashapaada.

Shlok 40b- 41: Shankana's son is Sudarshana, and from Sudarshana it is Agnivarsna... And Shiigraga is the son of Agnivarsna, and Shiighraga's 
son is Maru and from Maru it is Prashushruka, and Ambariisha is the son of Prashushruka... [1-70-41]

Shlok 42: Ambariisha's son was Nahusha, the emperor and Yayaati is the son of Nahusha, but Naabhaaga is born to Yayaati... [1-70-42]

[Commentary] These names Nahusha and Yayaati also occur in other Puraana-s, indicating them in earlier eras to Ramayana period.

Shlok 43: Aja was Naabhaaga's son and from Aja, this Dasharatha is manifest, and from him, from this Dasharatha, these brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana are born... [1-70-43]

Shlok 44- 45: "Oh, best one among men, Janaka, from the beginning this bloodline of Ikshvaaku-s is spotlessly immaculate, immensely impeccable, 
indomitable, and irreproachable, and in respect of these kings born in this line of blood, oh, king Janaka, I espouse that 
it will be meetly of you to offer your seemly daughters to this seemly pair of Rama and Lakshmana..." So said Vashishta 
to king Janaka. [1-70-44, 45]



SARGA 71
------------------------------

[Text] Janaka narrates his lineage while offering his daughters as brides to Rama and Lakshmana. In doing so, he elaborates 
			more about his brother Kushadhvaja, whose daughters are the would-be-wives of Bharata and Shatrughna. They even 
			fix the timings for marriage.

Shlok 1: When sage Vashishta said that way, Janaka reverentially made palm fold and said this in reply, "oh, sage, let safeness betide 
you all... now, it will be apt of you all to listen to our distinguished lineage..." [1-71-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, eminent sage Vashishta, he who is born in a particular noble gens has to inform about his parentage in its entirety, 
especially when he offers a bride... thereby oh, great sage, let all be informed of about our lineage..." [1-71-2]

Shlok 3: Once there was an emperor Nimi, who was renowned in the triad of worlds by his own accomplishments, and who was uniquely 
seraphic-souled and a best one among all stalwart emperors... [1-71-3]

Shlok 4: And his son was named as Mithi, and Janaka was Mithi's son... the first one to be designated as Janaka... and even from 
that Janaka it is Udaavasu who took birth... [1-71-4]

Shlok 5: From Udaavasu it is noble souled Nandivardhana took birth, and Nandivardhana's son is named as Suketu, by his name... [1-71-5]

Shlok 6: From Suketu the highly powerful and virtue-souled Devaraata is born, and from that kingly sage Devaraata, it is Brihadratha 
who took birth, thus we have heard... [1-71-6]

Shlok 7: From Brihadratha it is the highly braving, courageous and valiant Mahaaviira has come, and the bold and truth-valiant Sudhriti 
from Mahaaviira... [1-71-7]

Shlok 8: Form Sudhriti, the right-minded and highly generous Dhristaketu took birth, and from the kingly sage Dhristaketu it is 
highly renowned Haryashva is the son... [1-71-8]

Shlok 9: Haryashva's son is Maru, and Maru's, son is Pratiindhaka, and the son of Pratiindhaka's is noble-souled king Kiirtiratha... 
[1-71-9]

Shlok 10: The son of Kiirtiratha is remembered as Devamiidha, and the son of Devamiidha is Vibudha, and Vibudha's son is Mahiidraka... 
[1-71-10]

Shlok 11: Mahiidraka's son is the great mighty king Kiirtiraata, and the son born to sagely king Kiirtiraata is Mahaaroma... [1-71-11]

Shlok 12: From Mahaaroma it is the virtue-souled Swarnaroma, and from kingly sage Swarnaroma it is Hrasvaroma... [1-71-12]

Shlok 13: Two sons are born to that knower of virtue and noble souled Hrasvaroma, I am the elder, and my younger brother is this 
brave Kushadhvaja... [1-71-13]

Shlok 14: He that king and father of ours, Hrasvaroma, anointing me in kingdom as I am the elder, and vesting the duty of looking 
after Kushadhvaja in me, he departed to forests... [1-71-14]

Shlok 15: On the departure of our aged father to heaven, I am looking after this godlike Kushadhvaja with brotherliness and lugging 
around the burden of this kingship... [1-71-15]

Shlok 16: Then after sometime, a valorous king named Sudhanva came beleaguering Mithila, from his city Saamkaasha... [1-71-16]

Shlok 17: 'The unexcelled bow of Shiva shall be given to me, along with the lotus-eyed virgin, Seetha...' thus he started to urge 
me... [1-71-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, Brahma sage Vashishta, for the reason of my non-bestowal of bow or bride he warred with me, and when he affronted me 
in that war I have put that Sudhanva to the sword..." [1-71-18]

Shlok 19: Oh, best sage Vashishta, on eliminating king Sudhanva, I have anointed my valiant brother Kushadhvaja in the kingdom of 
Saamkaasha... [1-71-19]

Shlok 20- 21a: Oh, best saint Vashishta, this is that younger brother of mine, and I am the elder. Oh, eminent-saint, I am bestowing those 
brides with a highly gladdened heart... Seetha for Rama, and Urmila for Lakshmana, let there be felicity for all... [1-71-20, 
21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: My daughter Seetha is the bounty for bravery and in simile she is the daughter of the divine Providence, and thus the second 
one Urmila too... oh, eminent-saint, with a highly gladdened heart I reiterate thrice while I bestow those brides, there 
is no doubt about it... [1-71-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] The thrice reiteration is the threefold commitment mano vaak-kaaya-karaNaaH i.e., 'the three instruments of communication, 
mind, voice, and body... so I endow the brides whole-heartedly, clear-articulately, and agleam-physically...' Here this 
verse is addressed to Vashishta, while other mms say that it is aimed at Dasharatha by placing words 'raghunandana' instead 
of 'munipungava.'

Shlok 22b: Oh, king Dasharatha, let the preceding ritual of samaavartana, be undertaken, and let manes 
be propitiated by the ritual, naandi-shraadha, and afterwards you make happen the wedding celebrations 
... thus, all will be blest... [1-71-22b, 23]

[Commentary] The wording godaana differs from the ordinary lexical meaning 'cow donation' as the word gaavaka means 
body hair and daana is releasing, or let-going, i.e., shaving. When the students return home after the studentship 
they will be admitted into household after some rituals like shaving off unnecessary hair, taking oil bath etc.
go-dvayoH tu rashmiH dR^ig- 
baaNa-svarja-vajraambu-lomasu - naa naa - go daanam caulavat kaaryam shoDaShe abde taducyate | In this 
there will be a real cow donation also to the teacher of that student, when the students sheds his hair, after the barber 
attends him. After shaving off the unwanted hair, then samaavartana is undertaken. The problem pointed out at this 
place is, that Rama or Lakshmana are born without vyanjana-kesha unwanted hair, except head-hair, as Indian mythology 
will not give a hairy makeup to these four brothers. 'How then Janaka asked to undertake such ceremony, when discardable 
hair itself is not there...' is the objection. Whether they have hair or not, the ceremony has to go on.

Shlok 24: Oh, great dextrous Dasharatha, the star ruling today is magha, isn't it... oh, lord, on the 
third from now, say day after tomorrow, when the star phaalguNi comes, in its later part, namely
uttara-phalugNi, you may make happen this wedding, and the bounties like
go-bhuu-tila-hiraNyaadi i.e., ' cows, lands, grains, gold etc., that ensue the wellbeing 
of Rama and Lakshmana, may be accorded to the eligible generously... [1-71-24]

[Commentary] These old people have meticulously calculated stars and their sidereal times for marriage, but being old, they have forgotten 
to print the date of wedding on wedding invitations or, at least said about it. Thereby the dating of Ramayana has become 
a problem, and dating with Ramayana prospered.



SARGA 72
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra proposes the marriages of Bharata ad Shatrughna with the two daughters of Kushadhvaja, the younger 
			brother of Janaka. This being a welcome offer, Janaka accords his immediate consent. Then Dasharatha proceeds 
			with the initiatory rituals for the bridegrooms and donates cows and riches.

Shlok 1: Then the eminent-saint Vishvamitra together with Vashishta said these words to Janaka, the valiant king of Videha, who has 
just said about his lineage. [1-72-1]

Shlok 2: The Ikshvaku-s and Videha-s are unimaginably admirable and immeasurably distinguished dynasties, oh, Janaka, the best one 
among all men, there is no single king comparable to one from these dynasties... [1-72-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, king Janaka, these espousals of Seetha with Rama and Urmila with Lakshmana is behovely to each other's dynastical prestige 
and even it is befitting to the winsome charms of the brides and bridegrooms, but that being so... [1-72-3]

Shlok 4: Oh, grand sire, you may listen to my words of advise... this younger brother of yours, king Kushadhvaja, is at home in 
every kind of probity... [1-72-4]

Shlok 5: Oh, king, the pair of daughters of this right-minded Kushadhvaja is nonpareil in comeliness in this world, hence, oh, grand 
sire, we choose to pair them off with Bharata and Shatrughna... [1-72-5]

Shlok 6: Oh, king, for the sake of those two honourable boys, for that young man Bharata and for that smart man Shatrughna, we opt 
your brother's daughters... [1-72-6]

Shlok 7: All these four sons of Dasharatha have handsomeness and youthfulness, and they are equal to the four rulers of the world 
from four quarters, and their valour vies with the valour of God Vishnu... [1-72-7]

Shlok 8: "Oh, best king, let both these dynasties of yours, the impeccable dynasty of Ikshvaku-s and the immaculate dynasty of yours 
as well, be interlocked by these wedlock-s..." Thus Vishvamitra advised Janaka. [1-72-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing the words of Vishvamitra that have the concurrence of Vashishta then Janaka reverently said this to those two 
eminent-saints. [1-72-9]

Shlok 10: By which reason you two eminent-saints personally bid fair to this befitting proposal, thereby I opine that my dynasty 
is highly honoured... [1-72-10]

Shlok 11: So be it! Safe betides you all! Let the pair of Kushdhvaja's daughters, namely Maandavi, Shrutakiirti, devout themselves 
as a pair of wives to the paired brothers, namely Bharata and Shatrughna, respectively... [1-72-11]

Shlok 12: Oh, eminent-saint Vishvamitra, let the palms of four princesses be taken in the palms of these four mettlesome princes 
in marriage, in the light of one day... [1-72-12]

Shlok 13: "Oh, Brahman, the savants acclaim that part of the day as the best for wedding ceremonies when both of the pre-Phalguni 
and post-Phalguni stars are available, and on such a time where post-Phalguni is ruling, for which Bhaga is the presiding 
deity for progeny..." So said Janaka to the marriage party. [1-72-13]

[Commentary] There is a lot of commentary from the viewpoint of astrology regarding these stars and days of this marriage. Some have 
said that uttare divase 'on best day...' phalguni= puurva phalguni 'pre-Phalguni... on the best day under 
pre-Phalguni star...' which usually does not happen, but it is also said to be correct by Maheshvara Tiirtha, as the Moon 
will be in the 12th house at that time, so the marriage is agreeable...' However the stars for best results of marriages 
are: rohiNii-mR^igashiirShyaaNi 
uttaraphalgunii-svaati iti vivaahasya nakShatraaNi | bodhaayana suutraaNi

Shlok 14: On saying those gracious words thus, king Janaka got up from his throne and coming nigh of both of the eminent-saints, Vishvamitra 
and Vashishta, reverently said this sentence. [1-72-14]

Shlok 15: You two, oh, eminent-saints, have done an excellent generous act in my respect, thus I will ever remain your proselyte... 
you may please preside over these thrones, that of mine, my brother's, and that of Dasharatha... [1-72-15]

[Commentary] The kind deed done by the two sages, Vishvamitra and Vashishta, is fetching right husbands for his daughters, and for his 
brother's daughters, without flattening his own flatties. And this sitting on the three thrones is for assuming symbolic 
rulership on the three kingdoms, Ayodhya, Mithila, and Saamkaasya, in getting the marriages performed without a hitch.

Shlok 16: "As to how this city Mithila appertains to Dasharatha, in the same way city of Ayodhya is mine... and there shall be no 
hesitancy for you two sages in governance on these three kingdoms, thus it will be apt of you to make the marriages happen 
as aptly as you can..." So said Janaka to the sages. [1-72-16]

Shlok 17: The legatee of Raghu-s king Dasharatha is gladdened while the legatee of Videha is talking in such a hobnobbing way, and 
he replied king Janaka in this way. [1-72-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, kings of Mithila, Janaka and Kushadhvaja, you two brothers have reverenced inestimable sages and coteries of kings, 
as such inestimable good manners are treasured in both of you... [1-72-18]

[Commentary] Annex: 'As said in good sayings like, 'good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue...' as such, your abilities 
in making these marriages happen will edge out our limited capabilities... and if we commit any mistake unwittingly, that 
may besmirch your unblemished personality, because for the first time I am marrying my sons, you shall pardon... by the 
way, you have performed many marriages, concluding that every bride is your own daughter-like, thus we hear... thus, your 
sitting complacently on intrusting all the works of marriages to us, is infeasible... so, you do all the works and we sit 
comfortably seeing the celebrations...'

Shlok 19: "Enjoy that blessedness! Let safe betide you! We now depart to our visitatorial-palace, and we shall customarily carry out 
the tributary rituals..." Dasharatha said thus. [1-72-19]

Shlok 20: On seeking leave of absence from the sovereign of people, Janaka, that highly renowned king Dasharatha promptly departed 
from there, keeping both of the eminent-saints afore, namely Vishvamitra and Vashishta. [1-72-20]

Shlok 21: King Dasharatha on going to his visitatorial-palace has procedurally undertaken the tributary rituals, and on getting up 
in the next morning, he carried out the initiatory rituals of marriages, in a grand way, in which donation of cows is a 
part. [1-72-21]

Shlok 22: That lord of people king Dasharatha has righteously donated hundred thousand cows to Brahman-s, in the name of each of his 
four sons. [1-72-22]

Shlok 23-24: In that cow donation ceremony intended for his sons, he that best one among men and the one who is affectionate towards 
his sons, Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, has donated on behalf of each of his sons, four hundred thousand cows, that 
are abundant milkers, and that have golden casings on their horns, and that are with their calves, and along with milking 
jugs made with bell metal, and he even donated very many other kinds of assets to Brahmans. [1-72-23, 24]

Shlok 25: On performing the cow donations and samaavartana, snaataka, the initiatory ceremonies of his 
sons, as well, he that serene king Dasharatha who is amidst the quartet of his sons, shone forth like serene Brahma, who 
is quartet-faced, with the quartet of Veda-s, and who is the overlord of mankind, amidst the quartet of presiding deities 
in the quartet of the world. [1-72-25]

[Commentary] The 'unnecessarily' repeated word 'quartet' refers to dharma where its manifestation is with four horns, catvaarii 
shR^ingaa, trayo asya paadaa, dve shiirSe... 'dharma's horns is a quartet, three are its feet, two are its heads...' 
so on. When read together with 23, 24 verses, the bullish Dasharatha is said to have the quartet of bullhorn like sons, 
who are being readied to administer dharma in the world.



SARGA 73
------------------------------



We need not wait for any invitation or wedding card or call for this marriage, as all are welcome, equally and individually. 
Let us go there straight, without any introductions and preliminaries.

Shlok 1: On which day the king Dasharatha made the impressive cow donations or, initiatory rites, on that day alone the valiant Yudhaajit 
turned up. [1-73-1]

Shlok 2: Yudhaajit, the son of Kekaya king and the brother of Kaikeyi, thus the direct maternal uncle of Bharata, having seen and 
asked after the wellbeing of Dasharatha said this to him. [1-73-2]

Shlok 3: The ruler and king of Kekaya, viz., my father and your father-in-law, has affectionately asked after the wellbeing of all, 
and in whose wellbeing you are interested at my place, they are all hale and healthy as of now... [1-73-3]

Shlok 4: Oh, Raghu's legatee, oh, best king, my father and the king of Kekaya is interested to see my sister Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, 
and for that reason I am sent to Ayodhya... [1-73-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "Oh, lord of the land, in Ayodhya I have heard that you went to Mithila along with your sons for their marriages, and wishing 
to see my sister's son Bharata I promptly travelled here..." Thus Yudhaajit told Dasharatha. [1-73-5, 6a]

[Commentary] Is this entry of this maternal uncle of Bharata a forced one or does this have any bearing on the flow of epic... is a doubt, 
though not a question. Further he is saying 'my sister's son' i.e., Bharata alone, instead of 'all my nephews...' Whether 
this episode has a bearing on future events or not, one maama is entered in Indian epics, like this one and 
Shakuni maama in Maha Bharata.

Shlok 6b-7a: Then king Dasharatha on seeing the adorable guest who arrived in his presence, and who is a merited one for adoration, Dasharatha 
adored Yudhaajit well, with full observances. [1-73-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8: Then on taking rest for that night along with his noble-minded sons, and again on getting up in the next morning, and on 
performing morning-observances as a duty-bound king, Dasharatha arrived at the hall of Vedic-ritual, keeping the sages in 
his forefront. [1-73-7b-8]

[Commentary] He arrived at the Vedic-ritual hall that he was frequenting for the last few days. Unless invited the bridegroom's party 
will not enter the marriage hall, and nowadays such an invitation includes a small function also, called varapuuja 
as every bridegroom will be looked up to as Vishnu, and the bride as Lakshmi. The marriage hall is constructed nearby this 
Vedic-ritual hall, thus it is to be assumed.

Shlok 9-10a: Rama arrived at his father together with all of his brothers, keeping sage Vashishta and other eminent-saint ahead of them, 
on an opportune and appropriate hour called 'Victory...' and all the bridegrooms are adorned with all kinds of jewellery 
appropriate for the wedding time, and all have performed the auspicious ceremony for marriage-thread, conducted prior to 
the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent 
to marriage ceremony. [1-73-9, 10a]

[Commentary] The ceremony for the marriage thread, the sacred thread of marriage for knotting as a necklace of the bride, mangala- 
suutra is nowadays mixed up with gauri-puuja, and this gauri-puuja took precedence of that ceremony, 
because gauri-puuja, took its roots in the auxiliary Ramayana-s, where Seetha is said to have gone to Goddess 
Parvati's temple, prior to her marriage, to perform gauri-puuja, pledging herself to Rama. The thread bands tied 
at the wrists of both the bride and bridegroom is as per wedding time vows, to bring them under the pledge of marriage, 
until its consummation. Indian marriages are time-oriented and every function has to happen on the appointed hour. Hence, 
the arrival of bridegrooms is also on an opportune hour, which astrologically brings forth success of that event. But some 
say that this auspicious hour Vijaya occurs in the early part of the day, where this marriage is occurring in the later 
part of day, hence this time is to be reckoned as one that acquires some victory later in the epic.

[Commentary] Brides are not the lone category of people destined to wear jewellery. But bridegrooms are also asked to wear golden ornaments, 
at least one, on such occasions. The metal gold is said to contain some effect by which a man or a woman will be benefited, 
health wise: mR^itaa durluptam madhumat suvarNam dhanam jananam ruNam daarayiSunam... after all gold is gold.

Shlok 10b- 11: Then that godly sage Vashishta on going from Vedic-ritual hall to marriage hall said this to Janaka, "Oh, best one among 
best people, oh, king Janaka, having performed the auspicious marriage-thread ceremony, Dasharatha along with his sons is 
looking forward for the donor... [1-73-10b, 11]

Shlok 12: "In marriages all the puruSaartha-s , the component values of life, namely rightness, riches, 
revelries, and results of final release will be occurring only if the benefactor and beneficiary meet, isn't it. Hence let 
king Dasharatha come, and then on actualising this best marriage you too will be doing your best devoir as royal priest... 
[1-73-12]

[Commentary] Hindu marriage is not a contractual obligation because it protracts over seven life cycles of that couple. Therefore, it 
is calculated correctly and celebrated sacredly.

Shlok 13: Janaka is not just a decidedly valiant king but he is the profound knower of probity also, besides being an unreservedly 
generous king, hence he has already made all arrangements, and when he is spoken in this way by Vashishta that king replied 
this sentence to that right honourable Vashishta. [1-73-13]

Shlok 14: Who is that doorman that prevents your entry? Or, for whose orders you all await with a bated breath? Do you hesitate in 
your own house, or what? This kingdom is as good as yours... isn't so... [1-73-14]

[Commentary] These are neither questions nor surprises, but the usual retorts and repartees usually employed during wedding time by both 
parties, sandhi-s of northerners and sammandi-s, of southerners, i.e., the wedding parties. By these rebuttals 
and ripostes, both the parties come close with each other's family habits or with its members.

Shlok 15: Oh, eminent-saint Vashishta, on absolutely performing the auspicious ceremony for the marriage-thread, and thereby tying 
thread-band at wrists my daughters have already arrived, and they are at the base of the Altar of Fire, like the irradiant 
jets of flames of radiant fire... [1-73-15]

Shlok 16: "I am already ready and awaiting for you remaining at this Altar of Fire. Let everything be done indeed without any deterrents. 
What for the king Dasharatha is dawdling..." So said Janaka to Vashishta. [1-73-16]

[Commentary] And Vashishta reported this to Dasharatha, and Dasharatha and his coterie then started a wedding-walk, which usually will 
be dillydallying, inching and poking along, very leisurely. Even today this custom, not custom exactly, the habit of 'wedding-walks' 
is there and a baraat 'pageant of bridegroom's party' covers two furlong distance in two hours, or even more, keeping 
the bride's party on tenterhooks.

Shlok 17: On hearing that sentence of Janaka, then Dasharatha started towards marriage hall, and then he started to enter his sons 
one by one, four in all, into marriage hall along with all of the assemblages of sages. [1-73-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: Then that king from Videha bloodline, Janaka, said in this way to Vashishta, "Oh, the knower of punctilios, oh, Brahma-sage, 
oh, masterly sage, along with other sages you make happen all of the marriage ceremonies of Rama, the rejoicer of the world..." 
Thus Janaka spoke to Vashishta. [1-73-18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20- 21- 22- 23a: Thus said, that godly sage Vashishta on saying, "so be it," to Janaka, embarked on arranging Altar of Fire keeping sage 
Vishvamitra and the virtuous sage Shataananda afore of him, and that sage with great ascesis, Vashishta, has arranged an 
Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. 
Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with 
just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, 
and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled 
wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk 
etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and 
he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. [1-73-19b, 20, 
21, 22, 23a]

[Commentary] These are some of the usual paraphernalia for marriage ceremony even now. The sprouting sprigs are symbolic for the prospective 
sprigs from this marriage, and rice-flakes for the abundance of livelihood of the couple. Usually the concave lid like vessels 
will be filled with black cotton soil, and on them nine varieties of grain navadhaanya will be sprinkled to obtain 
sprigs. Later they are to be kept sacred for some days, watering daily, and then can be implanted in earth, if they survive. 
There are hosts of shops specialised to sell these items and the shopkeeper firstly asks for information 'for bride's side 
or for bridegroom's side?' And if we say, 'we are from bride's side' a long-list is presented, [while bridegroom's side 
will have a shorter list of items,] and then the shopkeeper mercifully asks 'how much is the dowry?' If we say this much 
or that much, he will present a Victorian model push-close pull-open velvet bag. If we exclaim 'what for is this, priest 
has not listed this' then he politely says, 'the priests of these days are unaware of customs and the dowry is to be put 
in that velvet bag and then given, as a royal presentation...' And if we say 'we are drained out by the dowry, wherefrom 
we give royal presentations...' then he will spew fire on us saying 'you spend so much on dowry, can't you purchase its 
velvet bag...' and thereafter a sermon follows about the dying Indian culture at the onslaught of westernisation, while 
he starts throwing the packets of navadhaanya etc., as though he is giving alms to the beggar. Though Janaka has 
not purchased such a bag of dowry, he has some more problems with this marriage. A discussion on this is there at later 
part. Here the sprouted sprigs are the sprouting avengers on the evil, called Ravana.

Shlok 23b- 24: Then that great resplendent and eminent-saint Vashishta neatly overlaid even-sized sacred grass on that Altar of Fire synchronising 
with Vedic-chants, and on preparing Ritual-fire by rubbing two wooden sticks, called araNi 
, he placed that fire in the pit of Altar, which is aflame now, and then reverently and in tune with the Vedic-hymns he 
effused oblational liquids into that Altar of Fire, with short-handled and long-handled wooden scoops. [1-73-23b, 24]

Shlok 25- 26a: Then that king Janaka led forth Seetha, who by now is decorated with every variety of bridal jewellery, and on positioning 
her en face Raghava in the presence of Altar of Fire, then Janaka addressed Rama who is the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's 
rejoice. [1-73-25, 26a]

[Commentary] By the way, where is this Kausalya? Does Rama enrich her happiness without bringing her to his marriage? We have not heard 
of her or of other queens or hosts of his other wives, for the last three, four days. Has she come, at all? - Yes, she has 
come and she is physically present - is the argument of some, basing on Valmiki's style of unrecorded accounts on trivial, 
or matter of fact scenes. They are implied and implicit. Dasharatha has performed some cow donations, religious functions 
etc., which he is not supposed to do without his wife at his side. These ladies are implicitly included in the first verse 
of sixty-ninth chapter: sopaadhyaayaH sabaandhavaH 'with teachers, with relatives...' and Dasharatha has no 
near relatives, not exactly relatives, but family, other than his queens and sons. So, they all are in 'et cetera... and 
others' cadre at present. Other way round, it is said in Kshatriya-s only male members will go and get the bride, which 
has no reasonable or tenable import, as far as marriages are concerned, and where every marriage concerns only with womenfolk 
and their panoply.

[Commentary] Seetha is said to have all bridal jewellery, which is not odd or particular to this corner of globe. But it is oddish and 
exotic jewellery if the bride is from well-to-do family or from royal family. Though not all, some of the jewellery items 
that are almost extinct now are listed here. siimanta-pralamba a pendant clipped at back of head, dangle through 
the central parting of head-hair, onto the crown of head, with nine-gem-stud locket; shiroja-suuci diamond studded 
hair pins on either side of head above ears; naasaabharanam a round nasal ring; naasabhuSaNam single 
or a pair of nine-gems studded nasal ornament; karNaabharaNa, taaTanka, karNikaa various kinds of earrings with 
dangling cups, to which trinket bells dangle; shata-yaSTika hundred stringed pearl necklace; anukanThii, muktaavalii, 
graiveyikam and many other kinds of necklaces; mekhala three finger width golden cincture, studded with nine-gems, 
and with fine golden chains dangling like festoons; saptakii seven stringed girdle string, where the strings dangle 
onto hip, with expanding festoons; keyuuram bicep-lets; kankaNam bracelets and bangles from wrist halfway 
up forearm; maNi-manjiira, tulaa-koTi, paadaangada ankle-let with kinkiNii trinket bell-globules; 
cuuDaamaNi a circular jewel at bun of hair from which a gold sheet dangles till the end of braid, on which all zodiac 
signs are engraved. At the top, on the left and right of this cuuDaamaNi ornaments in the shape of sun and moon 
are pinned into hair, and at the end of braid three / five gold cups studded with hair like strands upakaca will 
be dangling. This set of braid's ornamentation is said to receive the solar energy to whole of the spine. So goes on and 
on the list of ornaments, to the delight of the girl wearing them and to the delight of the goldsmith making them.

[Commentary] Here there are five Raghava-s and only one kausalyaanandavardhana i.e., Rama. Then poet should have simply said 
'Rama' instead of 'Raghava' but there are many Rama-s, Parashu Rama, and Bala Rama and suchlike, and on such calling as 
'Rama...' Parashu Rama, who is scheduled to enter after marriage, may perhaps enter now, in a faux pas. Then the poet should 
have said dasharathaatmajam . Then, who will be that single soul from among the four boys of Dasharatha to come 
forward. And if all the four hear the calling, as 'oh, Raghava' all will reply in chorus "ok, it is I..." then what will 
happen? Avoiding all these irksome situations, the poet gave this stage-direction to Janaka that he should aim at the son 
of Kausalya, with a subtext, 'you are mothered by some human female, whereas my daughter is motherless, rather un-mothered,
ayonijaa non-foetal is her origination, hence it is apt of you to not to belittle her, anytime and anywhere... 
and you have to keep faith with her, since she outshines in outperforming your task in this so-called incarnation...'

Shlok 26b- 27a: "This is Seetha, my daughter, she acquits herself in whatever duty you undertake. Take her wishfully, let safeness betide 
you, take her palm into your palm..." [1-73-26b, 27a]



Here Sita stands, my daughter fair, / The duties of thy life to share. / Take from her father, take thy bride, / Join hand 
to hand, and bliss betide! / - Ralph T. H. Griffith



The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza iyam, mama, 
tava 'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at 
some of them.



Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told "take her...' Why this iyam 
i.e., "this" It is explained as below:



Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking 
at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers



Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?



Janaka: Because she is 'Seetha '



Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion...



[Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his 'The Windhover' sheer plod 
makes plough down sillion /]



Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel 
of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because 
of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol 
of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally 
tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under 
your feet... vedaaham etam puruSham mahaantam aadityavarNam tamasaH parastaat | if the Supreme Person beyond 
darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul aham vedmi mahaatmaanam 
raamam satyaparaakramam - bala 19-14 likewise you shall know iyam siitaa, for she is somebody to match you... 
have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s



Rama: Why not every bit of it...  you name, it I tell it



Janaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?



Adi Shankara's commentary: There are three letters that denote the Absolute sa, ta, yam; and the syllable
ii on sat is for easy pronunciation. The letter sa indicates immortality and the word ta 
mortality, and the syllable yam conditions and bridges both the above ' Ramanuja comment: The letter 
sat is immortality and the letter ti is mortality and yam conditions both, hence sattiyam 
is indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness ' Madhvaacaarya says: sat, delivered immortal souls;
ti yet to be delivered bounded souls; yam both the delivered and bounded souls.



Janaka: Seetha is that yam the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal, setu - eSa 
setu iti vidhaaraNaa the presiding deity of cetana-acetana dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu 
Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion, raaghavatve bhavet siitaa... It is said 
in yet another scripture, yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii 
ca tathaa iishvarii || 'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller 
of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha 
alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth ratna-garbhaa and you are 
a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold anargham api maaNikyam 
hemaashrayam apekShate otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning 
you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or 
more Ravana-s



Rama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi



Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is 
manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also, ayam iishvarii is manifest as iyam this girl... from siitaa 
furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, 
and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above 
mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours



Rama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?



Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge 
from earth, a lovely act for you.



Rama: Then why mama sutaa... she can be fostered in any orphanage



Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not 
just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming 
of vi-deha... it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background 
and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as mama sutaa 'my daughter ' And many, many 
kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to 
counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; 
a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha, iyam siitaa 
mama sutaa as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards



Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey



Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in kanyaa-daana 'bestowal of bride ' because your 
marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... 
that is why I tell pratiicCha enaaam ' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me;
bhadram te 'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yours paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa ' you take her palm 
into your palm ' that which is customary in human paaNigrahaNa-mahotsava 'wedding ceremony '; by the way, you 
always keep your consort in your heart hR^idaya kamala do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your 
incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may 
come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby

[Commentary] Likewise, let us, the readers of rAmAyaNa, keep this info about Rama undisclosed to Ravana, if any of us meet Ravana by 
chance....



And we now proceed to the human level import of this verse.



Janaka: 'iyam "this girl" who has --- mugdhamanoharamanoj~namohanaatmakasukumaarasoundaryalaavaNyaadau--- 
a beauty par excellence [and par problmatique beauty as well, for Ravana alone has got more words to extol her beauty, as 
in Ch. 46 Aranya ];



so, iyam "this one" is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started 
towards Mithila;



hence, iyam "this one alone" is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva's bow, and 
whom you are envisioning praasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH 'on verandas of multistoried 
buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you ' during these days of your stay 
in Mithila....



Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral 
conclusion...



Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my 
daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that 
hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so,
iyam siita was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow...



Rama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans



Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I said mama sutaa 'my daughter ' when it is said mahataa 
tapasaa raama... ' by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama.. what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and 
fostered this girl with much better ascesis [than your father], and even protected her from warring factions [only to give 
back to you ]; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, 
why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal 
enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I said
sahadharmacarii tava ' she will be in toe with your duties'



tava dharmasahacarii ' whatever is your duty that duty become hers too '..



Rama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even



Janaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her... I have not said siitaam dadaami 
'I am donating Seetha ' but I said pratiicCha enaam 'take her, take her back ' or else, she will exit as she came 
and unfulfilled will be your mission... it is up to you to decide.... no compulsion whatsoever...



Rama: Then, let her take hold of my arrow and walk with me round the Altar of Fire, because, for Kshatriya-s that is the 
custom...



Janaka: I know, I know, but this marriage does not fit into any of the eight kinds of marriage prescribed for humans... 
hence I carefully said paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa' take her palm into your palm '

[Commentary] The types of ancient marriages as laid down by scriptures are eight kinds. 1] braahmya: inviting a celibate scholar 
after completion of his Vedic studies, and offering a bride with due ceremony; 2] daiva: offering a bride to a 
ritwik when he is conducting a Vedic-ritual; 3] aarSa: giving the bride after donating a cow and ox for the success 
of Vedic-ritual; 4] praajaapatya: offering a bride without seeking anything from the bridegroom, to follow the 
course of dharma; 5] aasura: giving ample money to bride's party or to bride and marrying her at costs; 6] gaandharva: 
man and woman falling in love and marrying on their own, just out of lust and bodily pleasures; 7] raakShasa: if 
a bride or bride's part do not agree, by maltreating, torturing and terrorising them, and thereby seizing the bride; 8]
paishaacika: while the girl is asleep, or making her drunk, or unconscious and then molesting her, by which she 
becomes a 'can't but' bride - a worst kind of marriage.

vivaaha iti cet - sahadharmacarii tava - iti uktyaa praajaapatya eva vivaahaH - dk

[Commentary] And when none of the eight is unsuitable for Seetha's wedding it is brought under the fourth praajaapatya- because
sahadharmam carati iti praajaapatya - aashvalaayana | samyogamantraH praajaapatye sahadharmam caryataam - gautama 
| sahadharmam carataam iti praajaapatyam - bodhaayana | But here something is sought from the bridegroom, in the 
name of lifting the bow. But that is negated saying the 'seeking' is the seeking of material assets, not valour or bravery. 
It is namesake, and even the nomenclature that Seetha is the bounty for valour viiryashulkaais a namesake; 
kShatriyeShu viirya vara eva shreShTatvaat taadR^ishaya kanyaam pradaatum viirya parishodhanam kR^itam iti shulka iti kathanaat 
shulka-shabdaH aupacaarikaH | dk Hence this marriage is for implementation of righteousness and it is treated as extramundane 
and celebrated every year.



Rama: This marriage does not fit into any category! Then why this marriage at all!



Janaka: To be in tune with this world's tradition... however, this marriage technically comes under the category of 
praajaapatya



Rama: So, you adjusted the rule books... then why me, let her take my hand...



Janaka: The enjoyer has to grab the object of enjoyment, not vice versa... take her now and bhadram te and 'be 
blest '

[Commentary] Next, Janaka is asking the bridegroom like a poor Indian father to take a poor and motherless bride Seetha.



Janaka: iyam - 'this' girl is a simple match to you who broke the bow of Shiva;



siitaa' born in furrow' a motherless girl, hence, kindly be merciful towards her;



mama sutaa ' my daughter ' rather, a poor fellow's daughter; where I have always been engaged in rituals and ceremonies, 
thereby I may not have brought her up properly, and thereby if she does talk rashly or behave oddly, like an ill-bred girl, 
kindly tolerate and correct her;



sahadhrmacarii iva where iva is ' like ' just take her like your 'custom-bound consort ' and let her 
be useful in ceremonies and rituals, though not for pleasure trips and excursions ';



pratiicCha enaam 'take her ' where the bridegrooms usually woo, court and date girls, send many messages to her 
parents asking for that girl in marriage; but, this girl being an uncommon one, I am begging you to take her;



paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa you take her hand as she is hesitating to take your hand, for your hand is strong enough 
to break an unbreakable bow, she is fearing to take your hand, lest her arm too will be broken;



bhadram te 'be blest ' when you honour our appeal



And there are many, many more shades of meanings derived from this verse, but all culminate to say - 'you two are made for 
each other '

Shlok 27b- 28a: "She who is prosperous and husband-devout, will always be abiding you like your own shadow..." So saying that king Janaka 
then poured forth water into the palms of Rama, which is sanctified with hymns. [1-73-27b, 28a]

[Commentary] Pouring water at the time of donation into the donee's hand symbolises the free flowing will of the donor. The 'shadow' 
expresses nitya-sambandhatva 'ever related entity...' Or, a trace of His liilaa-vibhuuti, maayaa. Though 
they are living separately so far, that farness is now washed off by this holy water.

Shlok 28b- 29a: Then there occurred great flower-showers from firmament, while sages and gods staying in firmament have exclaimed, "nice... 
fine..." to the drumbeats of heavenly drums. [1-3-28b, 29a]

[Commentary] What happened to these gods when boyish Rama eliminated Tataka and others? Are they any lesser feats than this marriage? 
And why this drumming and showering flowers and blessings, when it is 'just' a human's marriage? Now the cause for the effect 
is conjoined to Rama to effectuate their plea to Brahma. If the entire arsenal given by Vishvamitra is set-aside for a moment, 
the 'present' now presented by Janaka is the ultimate weapon for the use against Ravana. aprameyam hi tat tejo yasya 
saa janakaatmajaa 'unlimited is the energy, to whom Janaka's daughter belongs...' Rama is the instrumental cause 
in eliminating Ravana, whereas Seetha is the efficient cause for it. Lanka is ruined by Seetha, through Hanuma with the 
help of Fire-god, but not by Rama, or all of the monkeys put together. And Rama eliminates the half-dead Ravana. There are 
some more flower-showers and drumbeats and dances, later.

Shlok 29b- 30a: On handing over his daughter Seetha who is duly sanctified with sanctified waters, King Janaka is completely overwhelmed 
with exhilaration for the successful performance of his bit as a father and he said this. [1-73-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: Come on, Lakshmana, safe betides you... say yes to Urmila, the one who is decided by me to be given to you... take her 
palm into yours... lapse not the time... [1-73-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] When Bharata is the elder of Lakshmana, how Lakshmana is called now... is a lingering doubt. That rule 'the elder brother's 
marriage is first...' does not apply if the brothers are from co-wives: pitR^ivyaputre saapatne paranaariiShu teShu 
vaa | vivaahadaanayajnaadau parivedo na duuShaNam || 'the elderliness among the sons of father's brothers or mothers 
co-wives, or other sons from other wives, do not count in their marriages, donation ceremonies, of Vedic-rituals... an younger 
one can be called first on such occasions...'

Shlok 31b-32a: Janaka having said to Lakshmana that way, he also addressed Bharata, "Oh, Bharata, the delight of Raghu-s, take Maandavi's 
palm into your palm... [1-73-31b-32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: That honourable king of Mithila even said to Shatrughna, "oh, dextrous Shatrughna, take the palm of Shrutakiirti into yours... 
[1-73-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: "Oh, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna ... you all are tender-hearted, well-behaved and well-intentioned brothers from 
Kakutstha lineage... without lapse of time take up other ceremonies..." So said Janaka to bridegrooms. [1-73-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: All the four bridegrooms are palminpalmed with all the four brides, paying heed to Janaka's words, and abiding in Vashishta's 
orchestration of Vedic hymns and procedures. [1-73-34b, 35a]

[Commentary] The word 'palminpalmed' may look oddish, but it is in fashion with the verb 'arminarmed' invented by poet Roger McGhou.

Shlok 35b- 36: On performing circumambulations along with their wives around the Ritual-fire, and around the Altar of Fire, and that way, 
around king Janaka, the awarder of wives, and around sages as well for they conducted the marriages well, those great-souled 
bridegrooms that have emerged from Raghu's dynasty on performing further deeds of ritual consistent with custom as directed 
by Vashishta, they are all wed. [1-73-35b, 36]

[Commentary] Firstly Vashishta enkindled the holy fire and offered oblations in it for the wellbeing of Rama and his brothers, say the 
bridegrooms. Next, another round of enkindling of holy fire took place in which Rama and brothers have offered marriage 
time oblations. After accepting the palms of brides, they made circumambulations, and then each couple established its own 
ritual fire and offered oblations into it. Then each couple had oblated rice-flakes into the fire, and again performed circumambulations 
to that Ritual-fire, respectively. Thus, the marriage is not a handshake like one-minute affair, as they all shall be before 
fire, daylong.

Shlok 37: There occurred rich and highly dazzling flower showers from firmament, and that ambience is filled with the drumbeats of 
divine drums and with vocal and instrumental music, and promenades of apsara-s danced, and even the gandharva-s sang tunefully, 
and because it is the marriage of celebrated bridegrooms from Raghu's dynasty, such a charming spectacle is envisioned.. 
[1-73-37, 38]

Shlok 39: In this kind of ongoingness of harmonious music of vocal, instrumental and that of dancers, those great resplendent brothers 
married their wives on circumabulating the Ritual-fire fire thrice. [1-73-39]

Shlok 40: Then those legatees of Raghu went to their visitatorial-palace with their wives, followed by king Dasharatha along with 
the assemblages of sages, kinfolks, queens and wives included, and Dasharatha feasted his eyes on sons and daughter-in-laws. 
[1-73-40]



SARGA 74
------------------------------

[Text] Parashu Rama confronts the wedding party that is returning to Ayodhya from
          Mithila. On his very entry, the atmosphere becomes pell-mell and a whirlwind ensues.
          Expecting some problem from this Parashu Rama, the sages like Vashishta and others starts
          to receive him in a peaceable manner. Not caring anyone around Parashu Rama starts a
          dialogue with Dasharatha Rama.

Shlok 1: When that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, then the eminent-saint
  Vishvamitra on asking for the leave of absence from those kings, Dasharatha and Janaka, and from
  both Rama and Lakshmana, he set out to northern mountains, namely Himalayas. [1-74-1]

Shlok 2: When Vishvamitra departed that ruler to the delight of people, namely Dasharatha,
  on asking leave of absence with king Janaka who outvies bodily affairs, promptly set forth for
  the city of Ayodhya. [1-74-2]

Shlok 3- 4- 5a: Then that king Janaka of Mithila, the one from Videha lineage, gave innumerable
  patrimonial riches. He has also given umpteen number of cows, millions of excellent shawls and
  silk dresses, and elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, besides hundreds of highly
  decorated girls, divine in their mien, as unexcelled chambermaids and handmaidens to the brides.
  [1-74-3, 4, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: King Janaka gave beau idÃ©al bridal riches in gold, silver, pearls and corals even,
  for he is very highly gladdened as Seetha's marriage came true. [1-74-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Having given many kinds of bridal gifts and having accompanied his daughters for a
  distance, then having received a bid adieu from Dasharatha, that sovereign of Mithila, Janaka,
  re-entered is own palace in Mithila. [1-74-6, 7a]

[Commentary] It is customary to follow the wedding party up to the outskirts of village or
  town. In the meantime, there will be two or three hugs of mother and the bride, shedding two or
  three litres of tears, while the father of the bride secretly wipes his own moist eyes, and the
  like. Because, this despatch of the bride is considered as another life to her, for she cannot
  come to her father's house as and when she wants. Even if she comes, she has  to return to 
	her husband's place at some point of time, because from now onward 'that' house has become 'her'
  house. In this particular case of Seetha, she does not come to Mithila after this episode and
  even when Rama abandons her she goes into the womb of her mother, Mother Earth, but not to
  Mithila. So let us leave Janaka and his queen as they have the satisfaction in marrying their
  daughter, whose marriage itself is problematical so far, and when that has happened, now some
  sort of dissatisfaction has cropped up, in leaving her off with some forest ranger, called
  Rama.

Shlok 7b- 8a: Even the king Dasharatha, the sovereign of Ayodhya proceeded with his noble-souled
  sons, keeping all the sages in the fore, while his forces followed him. [1-74-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: But while going with the assemblages of sages and with young Raghava-s, namely
  Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, the sky-bound birds started to screech with startling voice
  from all around facing that tigerly-man Dasharatha. [1-74-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Also thus, all of the earth bound animals are going his leftward, and on seeing
  this, albeit he is a tigerly king he is perplexed, and particularly asked Vashishta. [1-74-9b,
  10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Unpropitious is the starling voicing of birds, whereby my heart is throbbing
  down... and propitious is the leftward going of the animals, thereby my heart is throbbing up...
  why so?" [1-74-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On hearing all that is said by king Dasharatha, the instinctual sage Vashishta
  said this sentence in a soothing voice, "I will tell apart the result of these auguries...
  [1-74-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "The shrieks voiced by the birds are foretokening the forthcoming providential and
  perilous trepidation, but the behaviour of these animals is betokening it as mitigable... hence,
  let this consternation be forsaken... [1-74-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: While they are discussing among themselves, a whirlwind started to whirligig
  there, as though to shake the earth and shatter all gigantic trees. [1-74-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Murkiness enshrouded the sun, thus everyone is unaware of quarters, a sandstorm
  enwrapped that army, by which it has become as though ensorcelled. [1-74-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Then Vashishta and the other sages, the king Dasharatha along with his sons
  remained there with animation, and everything and every other one available there has become
  inanimate. [1-74-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17- 18- 19: In that catastrophic darkness, that sand-muffled military of king Dasharatha has
  seen the son of Sage Jamadagni, namely Bhaargava Rama, the subjugator of kings of kings. He
  appeared calamitous in his look by wearing tufty matted and unruly head-hair, an unassailable one
  like Mt. Kailash, an unbearable one like the Epoch-End-Fire, irradiant with his own radiance,
  hence imperceivable for commoners, and such as he is, he clinched an axe on his right shoulder
  and clasped a bow in his left hand, that in simile is like a congeries of electroluminescence,
  and handling an arrow which is as if ready to electrocute, and he vied in his overall look with
  the devastator of triple cities, namely God Shiva. [1-74-16b, 17, 18, 19]

Shlok 20- 21a: On seeing him who is perilous in his propensity and flaming like the Ritual-fire,
  Vashishta and the other prominent Brahman-s who are the practisers of meditation and
  fire-oblations have come together and started to susurrate, up and down. [1-74-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b-22: "Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by
  the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously
  when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again,
  or what?" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. [1-74-21b, 22]

[Commentary] An account of Parashu Rama's elimination of Kshatriya clans is given in
  endnote.

Shlok 23: After their susurrus the sages have approached him, who in his very look is like a
  visitation, with oblational water and addressed him with benign words of greeting like, "oh,
  Rama, oh, Bhaargava Rama..." [1-74-23]

Shlok 24: On receiving the deference paid by the sage Vashishta, that inexorable Rama of
  Jamadagni started to talk to Rama of Dasharatha. [1-74-24]



SARGA 75
------------------------------

[Text] The visitant Parashu Rama narrates the legends of bows of Vishnu and Shiva to Rama. Unheedful of the request of Dasharatha 
to spare his sons, Parashu Rama addresses Dasharatha Rama directly and asks him to take an aim with the longbow of Vishnu, 
and if Dasharatha Rama is capable to do so, Parashu Rama says that he will give a duel to him.

Shlok 1: Oh, valiant Rama of Dasharatha, your valour is bruited as a sensational valour, and sensational is your smashing of Shiva's 
bow, also thus I have thoroughly heard about your others deeds like elimination of Tataka et cetera... [1-75-1]

Shlok 2: That way, smashing of that particular bow of Shiva is wondrous and even unimaginable... on hearing that alone I happened 
upon you, bringing another outranking bow... [1-75-2]

Shlok 3: This alone is that catastrophic bow received through Sage Jamadagni... flex it with an arrow on bowstring stretching up 
to your ear, and in that way show your capability... [1-75-3]

Shlok 4: "Thereby, on examining your strength in your taking aim with this bow, and should you be deservedly valorous, I will give 
you a combative duel..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-75-4]

[Commentary] Pt. Satya Vrat cites this in his book 'The Ramayana - A Linguistic Study... 'As in English, we speak of yuddhadaanam 
- giving a fight to the enemy - in Sanskrit, too...' it is giving a duel.

Shlok 5: On hearing that sentence of Bhaargava Rama, then king Dasharatha became a pitiable one, and with a downcast face and adjoined 
palms said this. [1-75-5]

Shlok 6: Aren't you a Brahman with inviolable ascesis, and whose rancour on Kshatriya-s has calmed down long back. Why this hostility 
again. It'll be apt of you to award aegis to my sons, for they are yet youngsters... [1-75-6]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'peace is primary for Brahman-s... though that was once disturbed in you, you redeemed it after your eradicating 
the then ruthless Kshatriya-s... thus your rancour was appeased then... and you too peacefully retired for inviolable ascesis 
and acquired still higher bliss by them... do you now wish to violate your own intrinsic nature of peacefulness being a 
blissful one, being an all-knower, being an elderly Brahman, that too on mere boys...

Shlok 7: Aren't you from the bloodline of Bhaargava-s who always conduct themselves in self-study of Vedas and self-principled ways... 
haven't you readily discarded weapon-wielding on your promise to Thousand-eyed Indra... [1-75-7]

[Commentary] Annex: 'how can you abnegate your own promise of shastrasanyaasa 'reclusion from weaponry...' by wielding a weapon 
now, and thus becoming yourself a self-critical personality, and thus making the entire Brahman-hood as a self-contradictory 
classis...

Shlok 8: Such as you were, you on becoming a dedicatee to probity, haven't you given the planet earth to Kashyapa and haven't you 
repaired to forests, and haven't you flagged yourself on Mt. Mahendra... [1-75-8]

[Commentary] Annex: 'if so, is this for showing the flag or else is it for keeping the flag flying... in anyway, is it inapt of you to 
eliminate the progeny of your own donee... Kashyapa... and if you say that 'I don't kill you all nonentities, but my target 
is this Rama...' then my reply will be like this...

Shlok 9: "Or, oh, insurmountable sage, have you chanced upon us for a total annihilation of ours... when Rama is singularised and 
eliminated, nay-said that we all will be living..." Thus Dasharatha had gone on appealing in his love for his sons. [1-75-9]

[Commentary] Annex: 'should you leave off Rama and eliminate rest of us all, Rama will not live... or, if you leave all of us and eliminate 
Rama alone, we all don't live... anywise it is an 'anywise' annihilation of ours... for I am still living for this Rama, 
and Rama alone...'

Shlok 10: While Dasharatha is speaking in that way that intransigent Bhaargava Rama of Sage Jamadagni uncaring for those merciful 
words of Dasharatha addressed Rama of Dasharatha alone. [1-75-10]

Shlok 11: These are the two strong and sturdy unsurpassed longbows, well-designed by gods and well-crafted by Vishvakarma, the Divine 
Architect, and these are very important among all bows and well-worshipped by all worlds... one broken in your, and the 
other in my hand... [1-75-11]

Shlok 12: Oh, best one among men, out of the two longbows gods gave one to restive Trymbaka, God Shiva for a combat with demon Tripura, 
and oh, Kakutstha, that bow alone is the annihilator of Tripura, the demon... and you have broken that alone... [1-75-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: This is the second one and the choicest gods gave this to Vishnu, thereby this is named after Him as 'Vishnu's bow...' 
this is an indestructible and enemy-citadel conquering longbow... and this is identical in its efficacy with Rudra's longbow... 
[1-75-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 16a: Once, all the gods were asking the Grandparent, Brahma, as to who is powerful and who is less powerful among the blue-throated 
Shiva and Vishnu... but the Grandparent Brahma on inferring the intent of gods started to create adversity among those two, 
Shiva and Vishnu, for the Grandparent is the best adherer of truthfulness, as truth cannot be demonstrated on hearsay evidence... 
[1-75-14b, 15, 16a]

[Commentary] 







Legend: Brahma thought that it would better to enact a drama to cleanse the one-sided mentalities 
of these lesser gods. So, he started to write the script, and himself becoming the writer-director of that drama. That script 
is hereunder.







Brahma: Mahadeva, who is the destroyer of Tripura, or say triple-citadels?



Shiva: Why? It is me, of course...



Brahma: Why do you boast that way of yourself? It is the long-arrow of your longbow, isn't it?



Shiva: Yes of course...



Brahma: Then Vishnu was presiding deity of that long-bow... isn't t?



Shiva: Yes, it is he, but I shot it from my bow... basically, is this a confusion, or, are you playing any part of Narada...



Brahma: Not so, the other day Vishnu was telling that he alone did that master task...



Shiva: How can it be! In the triple of doer-deed-instrument, instrument cannot become the doer... has his language gone 
topsy-turvy, noun is becoming verb and verb is lost to adjective and...



Brahma: Ok, Ok... we do not care much for grammar as we care more for communication, grammar is paNini's headache... but 
what he said is that he alone did it... not you...



Shiva: Then why I am called... why that longbow is given to me... you should have got it done by Vishnu... 
why calling me... you have unnecessarily 
spoiled my dance program...



Brahma: Not that... I said what he said... let's not quarrel among ourselves...



Shiva: I not only quarrel but wage war, if it comes to my interests and my devotees' interest... how many times I have not 
done so...



Brahma: That is what Vishnu was telling... every time you give a boon to every demon, and involve yourself in enmeshment, 
and Vishnu has come to come and rescue... have he forgotten the episode of bhasmaasura... thus Vishnu is saying and asking...



Shiva: Now I don't tolerate... I will take him to task...



Exit Shiva - Enter Vishnu. Brahma reverses the above dialogue and says that to Vishnu



Vishnu: No, No, highly objectionable... I will take him to task... I will take him to task...



Exit All. War Started.

Shlok 16b- 17a: Owing to their animosity then occurred a fierce and hair-raising war among Shiva and Vishnu, as each aspired victory for 
himself... [1-75-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: By the 'hum' sound of Vishnu that ruinously overpowering longbow of Shiva is broken, and the triple-eyed God, Mahadeva, 
is frozen... [1-75-17b, 18a]

[Commentary] The bow is jR^imbhitam broken by the hum in dissent of Vishnu - Govindaraja. And Maheshvara Tiirtha says that the 
bow as well as Shiva are rendered jaDa motionless. There are many legends on this shiva-garvabhanga 'deflation 
of Shiva's pride' and some info about is given in endnote.

Shlok 18b- 19b: Then gods along with the assemblages of sages and celestial carana-s have come together and appealed to those two for appeasement 
in the matter of wielding authority, and then those two superior gods, Shiva and Vishnu, went into a state of amity... [1-75-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "On seeing the bow of Shiva rendered inert by the mettlesomeness of Vishnu, from then on the gods along with the assemblages 
of sages deemed Vishnu to be the paramount... [1-75-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b-21a: That celebrated Rudra on his part with indignation has handed over that longbow, which is already fitted with unloosened 
arrow, to the sagely king among Videha kings, namely Devaraata... [1-75-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] This longbow of Shiva is reported as given after the devastation of the ritual of Daksha Prajaapati, the father of Sati 
and the father-in-law of Shiva as said at 1-66-9: dakSayaj~navadhe puurvam dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan | This ritual 
of Daksha is a composite of many problems. Shiva neither as god nor as the son-in-law of Daksha is invited to that ritual, 
Shiva's consort Sati self-immolates herself in her father's ritual, Viira Bhadra and other deputies of Shiva depredate 
that ritual, and this shiva-keshavayuddha 'duelling of Shiva and Vishnu...' happens... all to show - a single 
person's disinterestedness ruins even a holy marriage. Here Daksha was uninterested to give his daughter Sati in marriage 
to Shiva.

Shlok 21b- 22a: Oh, Rama, this alone is that enemy-citadel conquering longbow of Vishnu, and Vishnu handed over this to Sage Riciika, the 
son of Bhrigu, as a trustworthy trust... [1-75-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b-23a: That great-resplendent Sage Riciika on his part has handed over this divine bow to his son with unmatchable deeds of religious 
merit, who is my father Sage Jamadagni... [1-75-22b, 23a]

[Commentary] The word of Jamadagni means 'one who is born in Ritual-fire and having fire as his anima...' jaajamadya jajaane aham 
jajahii ha jajaayiSii | jamadagniH iti khyaatam tato maa viddhi shobhane || where the word jajaamanta is 'those 
who devour oblations repeatedly and at a single time in Vedic-rituals, namely gods; jamu - bhakshane so I am
jajiihi because I sprang up from Ritual-fire... and when the first syllable in ja jaamat is dropped it 
remained as jamat and when combined with fire jamat agni it shortened after dropping matup pratyaya 
to become jamadagni so oh, lady know me as one born and having Ritual-fire... or, Vedic-ritual itself...'

Shlok 23b- 24a: Adhering to a barbarous mentality Kaartaviirya Arjuna put my father to death, when the ascetically powerful father of 
mine has isolated himself from arsenal... [1-75-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b: Oh, Rama, on hearing the unregenerate and highly perfidious murdering of my father, I rancorously extirpated Kshatriya-s 
as and when they are born, that too not for one time, but I did so for thirty-seven times going around the earth... and 
on getting the entire earth under my control I performed Vedic-ritual, and at the end of that Vedic-ritual, I gave all that 
earth to sage Kashyapa, a sage with divine soul and with pious observances, as a ritualistic-generosity... and I am at present 
on Mt. Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me... [1-75-24b, c, 25, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27: On hearing about the breakage of Shiva's longbow, then I promptly came here. Thereby, oh, Rama, wield this supernatural 
and superlative longbow of Vishnu, which is passed on to me from my forefathers and my father. Keep your fealty to Kshatriya-hood 
in view, and wield this as you have wielded Shiva's longbow... [1-75-26b, 27]

Shlok 27: Take an aim with an arrow that conquers enemy's citadels fixing it on this supramundane longbow... and oh, Kakutstha, should 
you be capable of it, thereafter I will give you a duel... [1-75-27]

[Commentary] This is a long drawn bloody quarrel between the two sects of vaiSNavism Vishnu faith and
shaivism Shiva faith, over centuries. Here it is doubtlessly expressed in the epic that Vishnu 
is superior to Shiva. anena shivaat viShNoH utkarShaH 
pratipaaditaH - ayam eva arthaH | dk 'by this Vishnu is proposed to be superior to Shiva...' but it does 
not mean 'every time or everlastingly...' Insofar as the incarnations are concerned, it is Vishnu, but not Shiva. In philosophy, 
both are one and in theology, they are separate. sR^iShTi-sthiti-antakaaraNaat 
brahma-vishNu-shivaatmikaam | sa sanj~naam yaati bhagavaan eka eva janaardanaH || vishNu-puraaNa api cet samaram praapya 
bhaviShyasi maam adhikaH | bhaarata - droNa-parva ekam eva advitiiyam brahma - sat eva saumaya idam agram assiit - sarvam 
khalvidam brahma - brahmaa vaa idam agre asiit - hiraNyagarbhasamavartataagre - antarbahiH ca tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayaNa 
sthitaH - eka eva rudro na dvitiiyaaya tasthe - ekam sad vipraa bahudhaa vadanti ekam santam bahudhaa kalpayanti - abheda 
shruti where the last one is 'when there is only one Absolute wise men and poets create many of his forms...' 
to explain in ordinary parlance, that too through Puraana-s. This is because of the complexity of Vedas. In fact, Vedas 
do not tell anything straightaway 'this god, that is god...' but asks us, rather intuits us, to infer ourselves about the 
nature of god, according to our own IQ. And to be precise, Vedic gods are different from Puranic gods and Veda holds on 
to one Brahman, or The Absolute. The Rain-god, Fire-god, Indra et al are the instrumental gods in knowing that Absolute. 
The content of Vedas is just like the complexity of complex video game of present day. The more you play you either get 
yourself addicted to it, or shun it, or get demented by it.

[Commentary] Vedas go on saying pure truths in plain terms like: sham naH suuryorucakShu- 
udaitu sham nah catasraH pradiipto bhavantu | sham naH dhruvayo bhavantu naH sindhavaH shamu san santi aapaH || R^igveda 
7-35-8 - 'Bless that the sun, with extensive radiance, Rises for peace. May the four quarters of horizon, Be auspicious 
for peace and harmony...' What is so great about the sun or his radiance? If we persist in asking why this is said like 
that, then a dozen other quotes will be brought in to explain the idea behind it. Again another hymn:
sahasrashiirShaa puruShaH 
sahasraakShaH sahasrapaat | R^igved 10-90-1 - 'He has thousands of heads, He has thousands of eyes...' 
It would be ridiculous to think of a god with thousands of heads and thousands of eyes, but if it is explained 'He has thousands 
of heads, to think about mankind, and he has thousands of eyes to watch over the good and bad deeds of mankind... it may 
be meaningful. Max Muller has this to say about the study of Vedas:

[Commentary] Of course, this learning of Vedas by heart is carried on under a strict discipline; it is, in fact, considered as a sacred 
duty. A native friend of mine... tells me that a boy, who is to be brought up as a student of Rig Veda, has to spend about 
eight years in the house of his teacher. He has to learn ten books: first, the hymns of Rig ved; then a prose treatise on 
sacrifices, called the braahmaNa; then the so-called Forest book or aranyaka; 
then the rules of domestic ceremonies; and lastly, six treatises on pronunciation, grammar, etymology, metre, astronomy, 
and ceremonial...' India can it what teach us, by Max Muller - a recent republication of Penguin.

[Commentary] All the above is for no practical utility in these days, except for an enquiry into that 'Brahman.' So also there is a probability 
for phonetic problem uccaraNadoSa in Vedas which causes pratyavaaya 
a boomeranging bad effect. If we wish to chant its hymn 'oh, Indra, slay my enemies...' and if a diphthong or a diagraph 
is mispronounced it becomes 'Oh, Indra, kill me, instead of my enemies...' and it is said to happen that way
yad bhaavam tad bhavati... Unless they are practised for a life time, they are un-understandable, 
hence they are set aside and Puraana-s are brought in their place. Further, the effect of Vedas is said to be declining 
according to yugadharma era theory... What that was available in satya- 
yuga a period where the conflict was only between god and man, for e.g., the legend of Harishcandra and his truth 
speaking, which stands tested by almost all gods, but that truthfulness is lessened in treta-yuga 
Ramayana's period, where the conflict was between man and demons, which dharma is further lessened in
dvaapara-yuga period of Maha Bharata, where the conflict is among one's own brothers, and that 
much dharma of that period is almost extinct in kali-yuga which is obvious, from the known 
history of India, where the conflicts are going on between man and man - husband and wife, father and son, neighbour and 
neighbour, and so on.
This is on par with the four-legged dharma, The Holy Bull, nandi 
loosing its legs one after the other and now you will see that Bull in any sculpture with half raised right foreleg, where 
other three went under its belly.

So Puraana-s are evolved to throw some light on what Vedas have to say, of course with some religious overtones. Elsewhere 
we have detailed about Puraana-s of them Shiva and Vishnu Puraana-s are though prominent, but their adherers quarrel tooth 
and nail about the superiority of Shiva or Vishnu. In Vishnu Puraana many instances of coalescence of Vishnu with Shiva 
are narrated tvat vaakyagauravaat etat 
mayaa cakram nivartitam | tvayaa yat abhayam dattam tat datttam akhilam mayaa - Krishna says to Shiva 
at the time of eliminating a demon called Baana Asura, 'As you say I have taken back my disc, and if you give a boon I deem 
all that is given by me...' So many instances can be quoted like this. But here Parashu Rama has no intention to kill Dasharatha 
Rama, as said in Padma Puraana: rarakSha bhagavaan - bhaargava 
raamaH - ekam ikShvaakostu mahaakulam | maataamahasya anvayatvaat reNukaavacanaat tathaa | 'that god 
Bhaargava Rama safeguarded one great dynasty of Ikshvaku-s, for they are related to his grandmother, besides at the request 
of Renuka Devi, his mother...' So, god Bhaargava Rama is a nepotist and saved Dasharatha Rama. Not so, Bhaargava Rama is 
neither a nepotist nor a god to be worshipped. He is not worshipped because his incarnation is not a full incarnation of 
Vishnu as Dasharatha Rama. Only the wrathful impetuosity of Vishnu is incarnated like Bhaargava Rama to perform butchery 
and even infanticide. bhaargavo ati dR^iptaH prasiddhaH 
tadaaniim ca krodhaandha iti svakShatriyavadhaat upratam shastrasannyaasam ca parityajya capala iti viditaH 
'Bhaargava Rama is a highly impudent personality and blinded by his wrath, thus to eliminate his own Kshatriya-s [namely 
his own relatives, Dasharatha and his sons; again the caste system is peeping in, isn't it!] On overstepping his pledge 
of renunciation of weaponry, he came... hence his actions are faltering...' appayaa diikshita, 
a shaivaite. He came here to perform certain unsaid action, which we will see in next episode.

[Commentary] This is on par with the four-legged dharma, The Holy Bull, nandi

SARGA 76
------------------------------

[Text] Rama takes aim with Vishnu's longbow and asks Parashu Rama to choose the target to release the arrow, as arrow 
			of that bow cannot go astray. Parashu Rama opts for elimination of his ascetic merit and heavenly realms thereby. 
			Rama releases the bow annihilating that merit and after that, Parashu Rama retreats into oblivion.

Shlok 1: On hearing that sentence of Rama of Jamadagni, then Rama of Dasharatha said this to him in a courtly owing to the presence 
of his father Dasharatha. [1-76-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness towards your father, 
I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness from your paternal debt, but... [1-76-2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble 
one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness..." So said Rama to 
Bhaargava. [1-76-3]

[Commentary] Up to here both these Rama-s are in close quarters with other few present there. After this dialogue, they have moved a 
little away from the throng and facing each other as true combatants. A swordsman or an archer needs an arm-length, or sword-length 
or bow-length, at the least, to swagger his weapon. This place is to be assumed as an isolated place and no one is seeing 
or listening. This scene has an analogy in Maha Bharata when Krishna teaches Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. There, it is said, 
that Krishna froze the time to teach all the eighteen chapters, and none among two sides of warring factions are aware of 
Krishna, his teachings, or of Arjuna, excepting Sanjaya, who is placed at a distant place and has seen all with his wisdom-eye. 
Here we have to borrow that wisdom-eye of Sanjaya and see at these two Rama-s and their actions. When their episode is over 
the mist cast around them, rather on our eyes, will be cleared, when Rama returns to his father. This is said in later verses. 
Further more, all the people available there are rendered unconscious at the arrival of Bhaargava Rama, and a few like Dasharatha, 
Vashishta, Rama's brothers are with senses. So, even if they hear and see this scene, those listeners or seers do no harm 
in revealing Rama's godhood to world, or in particular to Ravana.

Shlok 4: Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that estimable weapon, 
namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow that is already fitted on it... 
[1-76-4]

[Commentary] and, along the same lines Rama also said to have extricated the essential nature of Bhaargava...' The above said 'distancing' 
of these two Rama-s has another purpose. Rama has certain innate nature of making his observers enchanted by his very personality. 
Even Ravana looks at him adoringly in the war scene. This apart, his hand has certain ability to extricate the innate nature 
of others, should he lay his hand on them. We rarely see him touching or patting others, except for Seetha, Lakshmana, Hanuma, 
and say a squirrel etc. So, it is believed that, Rama has now expropriated the essential nature of Vishnu from Bhaargava 
Rama, while snatching the bow from his hands. For this Padma Puraana says:iti uktvaa devii vaiShNavyaa shaktyaa tad 
gataayaa saha | jagraaha vaiShNavam caapam vinayena ca liilayaa || 'oh, Devi Parvati, saying so Rama took away the 
Vishnu's anima from Bhaargava Rama, along with bow of Vishnu, sportily and obediently, too...' Thus, Rama of Dasharatha 
bade goodbye to his earlier incarnation, Parashu Rama, as two swords cannot be in one sheath.

Shlok 5: On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim with it, but being 
indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of Jamagadni. [1-76-5]

Shlok 6: Oh Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship with Vishvamitra, 
and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow that exterminates your life... [1-76-6]

[Commentary] Bhaargava-s are Brahman-s and a Brahman cannot be killed braahmaNo na hantavyaH then how Rama is prepared to eliminate 
a Brahman, subjecting himself to the sin called 'Brahman killing...' brahmahatyaa paataka... There is no sin in 
eliminating a Brahman who is weaponed and warring. tathaa ca bhaarate raajadharme kR^iShNam prati bhiiShmaH - pitruun 
pitaamahaan pitryam guruun sambandhibaandhavaan | mithyaapravR^ittaan yaH sa~Nkhye nihanyaa dharma eva saH || Maha 
Bharata, shannti parva. 'It is no sin to eliminated fathers, grandfathers, teachers, and the like [even if they are Brahman-s,] 
for they are under an illusion, called war...' So said Bhiishma to Krishna and thereby Panadava-s have eliminated Drona, 
Kripa, Ashvatthaama and suchlike weaponed Brahman-s in war, but not in peace. There are many more such sayings of Bhiishma. 
Here Parashu Rama said that he will give a duel to Rama, hence he is no more a Brahman when he raises a weapon. And he is 
a blood relation of Vishvamitra, and that corner of mercy is not allowing Rama to release the arrow on Parashu Rama.

Shlok 7: Oh Bhaargava Rama, either this motility of yours at the speed of your mind, or even those unparalleled realms of heavens 
which you have earned by the power of your ascesis, I will eliminate whichever you wish... [1-76-7]

Shlok 8: "This Vishnu's divine arrow is the conqueror of opponents' citadels, and a vanquisher of their vigour and vainglory, and 
it will not fall through wastefully... isn't it!" So said archer Rama to axeman Rama. [1-76-8]

[Commentary] The debate on the superiority of Vishnu or Shiva may have its own mythological import, but as far as Ramayana is considered, 
the eulogy for Vishnu's longbow is intended to suggest the all-powerful capacity of Vishnu in eliminating demons and to 
lead the epic to its own goal. Dharmaakuutam has to say this: prakR^ite - adhikam menire vishNum - iti raamaayaNavacanam 
tu agre kartavyasakalaraakShasavadhahetubhuutavaiShNavadhanuShaH praashastapratipaadanaparam j~neyam | Hence 
the mythological quarrels have no place in Ramayana.

Shlok 9: Gods together with the assemblages of sages have come keeping the Grandparent Brahma at their fore, likewise the gandharva-s, 
apsara-s, siddha-s, caarana-s, kinnaraa-s, yaksha-s, sprites and reptilian beings have also come to see Rama who is now 
wielding the extraordinary longbow of Vishnu, and extremely amazing event that is going to ensue. [1-76-9, 10]

[Commentary] The 'amazing event' is not the handing over or taking over of longbow, but it is the transference of the essential nature 
of Bhaargava Rama to Dasharatha Rama. Nrisimha Puraana has this: tataH parashuraamasya dehaat nirgatasya vaiShNavam 
| pashyataam sarvadevaanaam tejo raamam upaavishat ||

Shlok 11: Then, when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being rendered 
as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama of Dasharatha. [1-76-11]

[Commentary] Vividly: When the aura of Vishnu available in Bhaargava Rama has entered Dasharatha Rama through that inscrutable longbow 
of Vishnu, Dasharatha Rama's aura dazzled like that of Vishnu, and that dazzlement of Vishnu's aura threw the world in a 
daze, and then that aura-less, thus vigourless Bhaargava Rama has nothing to do except to stare at Vishnu-like Rama, with 
upraised eyes.

Shlok 12: Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama of Dasharatha, and 
he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly. [1-76-12]

Shlok 13: Once, when I donated entire earth to Sage Kashyapa, Kashyapa told me 'uninhabitable is my domain, viz., this earth for 
you...' thus... [1-76-13]

[Commentary] A donor cannot enjoy a gift anymore, once donated to the donee. And if the donor still clings around that donation, it does 
not come under the true definition of 'donation.' Hence, Parashu Rama is asked to depart from this world. Hence he has gone 
to the ethereal mountain called Mt. Mahendra.

Shlok 14: Such as I was, in my observance of my mentor Kashyapa's order I do not spend nights on this earth from then afterwards, 
oh, Kakutstha Rama, as I made over this earth for Kashyapa, indeed... [1-76-14]

Shlok 15: Thereby oh, valiant one, it will be inapt of you to impair this motility of mine, oh, Raghava, I will depart with the speed 
of cerebration to Mt. Mahendra, a par excellent mountain... [1-76-15]

Shlok 16: But I triumphed over matchless realms of heavens with my ascesis, oh, Rama, you may hash them up with that irreversible 
arrow... let there be no time-lag... [1-76-16]

Shlok 17: I have realized your touch of nature as that of the Immutable Supreme Being, God of Gods, the Exterminator of the demon 
Madhu, namely Vishnu, by the touch of your handling that bow... oh, enemy-inflamer, blessedness alone betides you... [1-76-17]

Shlok 18: All of these gods who have come collectively are beholding you and your next move, for you are an unequalled one in your 
achievements and to whom there is no counter-dueller in conflicts... [1-76-18]

[Commentary] Parashu Rama is hastening up Dasharatha Rama to finish business quickly, otherwise the nature of Rama and his incarnation 
will publicized, not by these two Rama-s, but the game watching gods. If these spectators stay for a long time in sky, some 
airborne demon will let the cat out of the bag.

Shlok 19: Oh, Kakutstha Rama, you are the lord of the triad of worlds, such as you are, you faced me down, and it is malapropos to 
say that this is a disgrace to me... [1-76-19]

Shlok 20: "It will be apt of you to unloose that unsurpassed arrow, oh, Rama, as you have ethical commitment to wipe out demons as 
I wiped out menacing kings, and should you unloosen that arrow now I wish to depart to the ethereal mountain Mt. Mahendra, 
a point of no return for me..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-76-20]

Shlok 21: While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off that nonpareil arrow 
from that longbow of Vishnu. [1-76-21]

Shlok 22: On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to 
Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain. [1-76-22]

[Commentary] Rather, ready to depart... as he is given some more role-play in next verses.

Shlok 23: Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, and the gods with 
the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised. [1-76-23]

[Commentary] Please refer the endnote about this longbow and how it is passed on to Janaka's dynasty.

Shlok 24: Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to Rama of Dasharatha, 
went on his own way into oblivion. [1-76-24]

[Commentary] The bestowal of Shiva's bow to the dynasty of Janaka is said variously at various places. In the hermitage 
Vishvamitra it is said that the bow is given in Vedic-ritual taddhi puurvam narashreSTha 
dattam sadasi daivataiH | 1-31-8 In the previous chapter it is said that the bow is given in 
the hand of Devaraata devaraatasya raajaRSeH dadau haste sasaayakam | 1-75-20 
And earlier it is said to be given in Dasksha's ritual dakSayaj~navadhe puurvam 
dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan | 1-66-9 Seetha says about this to ascetic Lady Anasuya that Rain-god 
gave this to Janaka's dynasty mahaayaj~ne tadaa tasya varuNena mahaatmanaa | dattam 
dhanurvaram priityaa tuuNii caakSayyasaayakau | Ayodhya II-118. These statements, though not 
self-contradictory, and though they create a little confusion, they all are correct. When Daksha's Vedic-ritual 
is devastated, Shiva wanted to throw back the useless bow, that was worsted by Vishnu's bow, on the 
face of gods. But gods fearing for the ire of Shiva requested Shiva to give that bow to Devaraata, on 
their behalf. Shiva gave it to Devaraata as a trust, through Rain-god Varuna, but Shiva did no bequeath 
it. Later Janaka on appeasing gods in Vedic-ritual asked them to leave the bow once for all in Janaka 
Dynasty. Gods have agreed to it. And Rama broke it.

[Commentary] Now Dasharatha Rama gives back the other bow of Vishnu brought by Parashu Rama to the same Rain-god 
Varuna, who is present there at both Rama-s, in the thin air, when the environ is enshrouded by certain 
darkness, and when Rama is last seen with that upraised longbow at 1-76-23, and just before darkness 
is dissipated, Rama gives that bow to Rain-god, according to the first verse in next chapter.

[Commentary] Well known is Krishna's showing his Cosmic Form vishvaruupa to Arjuna, 
while teaching Bhagavad Gita in Maha Bharata. But that Bharata records Rama's display of His Cosmic 
form to Parashu Rama, only at this juncture. In Ch. 89 of anushaashanika parva 
of Maha Bharata it is said in detail as: pashya maam svena ruupeNa cakShuH te vitaraamyaham | tato 
raamashariire vai raama pashyati bhaargavaH |aadityaan pavamaanaan rudraan saadhyaan ca samarudgaNaana 
| pitaro hutaashanaH caiva nakShatraaNi grahaaH tathaa | and a long account follows on this. But 
this has not been amplified or explained in other texts, due to unknown reasons. However, it is not 
part of Valmiki Ramayana.



SARGA 77
------------------------------

[Text] The wedding party arrives at Ayodhya on the exit of Parashu Rama. Yudhaajit, the maternal uncle of Bharata, 
			who came before marriages, now takes Bharata and Shatrughna to his kingdom. Rama and Lakshmana from then on 
			are engaged in the welfare works of their subjects, at the behest of their father. Rama and Seetha will then 
			enter the threshold of their blissful married life.

Shlok 1: On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and he gave away that 
longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god. [1-77-1]

[Commentary] On this longbow and its giving to god of Rain, some discussion is incorporated in the earlier chapter.

Shlok 2: On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu's lineage, placatingly 
addressed his agitated father Dasharatha. [1-77-2]

Shlok 3: "Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, 
to move on towards Ayodhya..." So said Rama to his father. [1-77-3]

Shlok 4- 5: On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the forehead of Raghava, 
and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is further gladdened in deeming 
that he and his sons took a rebirth. [1-77-4, 5]

Shlok 6- 7- 8a: Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful city Ayodhya, whose 
royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and bannerettes up above 
them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with urbanites welcomers who 
are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, 
flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced 
at their king's re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. [1-77-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king Dasharatha followed 
by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the lofty and lordly Himalayan 
palazzo. [1-77-8b, 9]

[Commentary] 'King entered the house...' is not just an entrance of a character into a scene, but it entails a lot of ceremony called
gR^ihapravesha 'entering into householder-hood, the second stage of life gaarhapatya-dharma out of the 
four stages of living, 1] celibate scholar, 2] householder, 3] repairing to forest or sageship, 4] final release, moksha.
paaNigrahaNaanantaram kriyamaaNo gR^ihapraveshaH - dk where ceremonies go on for hours together.

Shlok 10- 11a: In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and when his long 
cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and other wives are 
overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides. [1-77-10]

[Commentary] Again this 'receiving bride' is an elaborate variety of fun and games of womenfolk will take place, at which place there 
is almost no entry to men. For example, name telling. An Indian bride, or the later time wife is supposed to not to call 
her husband by his name. It is a sacred taboo, and her addressing shall be in genderless, person-less, and numberless hooting, 
cooing or calling like e jii - o jii - emanDii - ennango - shuniye so on. To cite one such ceremony it is 'naming 
game.' Here the bride is compelled to tell the name of her husband, and she will be hesitating to do so, because of her 
newness to this house or to her husband. After some teasing attempts, she mutters her husband's name, and then only she 
will be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and dampening is that fun, in these days of 
readymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly functions, they do all those womanish things... 
because, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained 
four brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness. It may be observed that Kaikeyi is the lone queen with 'beauty' 
as her attribute, and the problem with her is seeded here alone, saying that enchantment of Dasharatha towards her outweighs 
his affection to Rama, later.

Shlok 11b-12a: Then the womenfolk of the king welcomed the highly propitious Seetha and the highly fortunate Urmila too, along with both 
the daughters of Kushadhvaja, namely Maandavi and Shrutakiirti, with pageantry and festivity. [1-77-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b-13a: All of the brides and bridegrooms clad in silks promptly worshipped the gods in sanctums to the benedictory chanting of 
Vedic hymns and Ritual-fires, thus they shone forth like the tongues of Holy Fires of Vedic Altars. [1-77-12b, 13a]

[Commentary] These young couples by themselves are radiant, and they are now clad in radiant silks that glitter wavily like the tongues 
of fire, and the Ritual-fire s are already there flaring wavily, to the weave-like chanting of Vedic benedictions. With 
all these waving, flaring, glaring the couples too appeared as the humanly Ritual-fires before the wood burnt Vedic Ritual-fires.

Shlok 13b- 14a: Then all the princesses paid respects to all of the respectable ones, and they luxuriated in sequestered palace-chambers 
along with their husbands. [1-77-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] This 'paying respects to respectable elders' is but one line. In reality, the torsos of those that pay respects will be 
put to test, because they have to 'pay' by bending and touching the feet of elders, each time to each, paadaabhivandana, 
pai lagoo . And if the girls are from jeans or pants culture, [because days have gone,] they will be fresh and new 
to bridal sari, which itself will be a weight to carry. And many times we see the young brides falling on the blessing couple 
because her bridal sari gets entangled in the toes of the bride, and she is not yet ready to manage it. So goes on this 
parade until their backs are broken.

Shlok 14b- 15a: And those best men among men, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, who are by now accomplished persons in weaponry and 
whose marriages have also come to pass, occupied themselves in the welfare of kingdom while assisting their father and moving 
around with good hearted people. [1-77-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Then after sometime that king Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, spoke to his and Kaikeyi's son, Bharata. [1-77-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "This is your maternal uncle and the son of king of Kekaya, and this valiant Yudhaajit came here to take you to Kekaya province, 
and he is staying behind because of your marriage..." thus Dasharatha bade farewell to Bharata suggesting that Bharata may 
now go with Yudhaajit. [1-77-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: On hearing the opinion of Dasharatha, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, then readied himself to travel along with Shatrughna 
to Kekaya province. [1-77-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: That valiant and best one among men Bharata on asking leave from his father, from Rama, an uncomplicatedly dextrous one 
in undertaking deeds, and even from his mothers, Kaikeyi, Sumitra, and Kausalya, travelled on along with Shatrughna. [1-77-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b-20a: Yudhaajit on clinching not only Bharata, but Shatrughna also, that valiant one is highly gladdened and entered his own city, 
indeed to the high rejoice of his father, King of Kekaya. [1-77-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: After the departure of Bharata, then the masterly proficient Rama along with Lakshmana started to square with the plans 
and programs of his godly father for an ideal-sovereignty. [1-77-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22-23a: Rama keeping his father's directives in view undertook welfare activities for the people that are agreeable and even advantageous 
to them, and in the entirety of those activities, and he undertook activities to humour motherly affection with his mothers, 
and educational activities with educators, and in a highly self-disciplined manner he used to review them carefully from 
time to time. [1-77-22b, 22, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24-25a: That way Dasharatha is pleased with the deportment and comportment of Rama, likewise the Brahman-s and urbanites, and even 
all of the indwellers in the entire kingdom are pleased, and he who has high distinction, his truthfulness alone is his 
vantage point, and whose hallmarks are of higher degree, that Rama has manifested himself to those subjects in the kingdom, 
and even to all of the living beings in the world, as the Self-Created Brahma. [1-77-23b, 24, 25a]

Shlok 25b-26a: Also, that hearty Rama who permeated into the heart of Seetha is ensconced in Seetha's heart alone, and he disported for 
many seasons along with Seetha. [1-77-25b, 26a]

[Commentary] The other mms use raamaH tu instead of raamaH ca where this tu says a difference. Then, 'Rama 
is busy in welfare and other works of state, tu 'but' he is also impassioned for Seetha. And he is manasvii 
'hearty one' warm, friendly, spirited etc., are his dispositions for kingdom, people, governmental works tu 'but' 
he is that 'hearty' for Seetha... Hence tad gataH - tasyaam gataH 'he pervaded her psyche, hence casketed in her 
heart... In the other mms it will be tasyaaH hR^idi nityam samarpitaH 'heart of Seetha is 'always' dedicated to 
Rama... and that word nityam 'always, eternal, everlasting...' couple. So, they may be a couple from time immemorial
tu 'but' they are as good as a fresh and fervent young couple... bahuun R^ituun 'for many, many seasons 
to come...' he is disporting with Seetha. Why tell seasons when there is calculated calendar with years, decades, and centuries... 
Not so... their disporting is according to seasons, with seasonal environ, with a seasonable togetherness... vijahaara 
is grammatically a parasmaipadi then the fruition goes to the subject, and subject of the verse is Rama, so he 
alone is the enjoyer and insatiate is his enjoyment with Seetha, even during and after bahuun R^ituun many, and 
many seasons. niravadhikaparasparabaddhaanuraagaabhivR^iddhi ' an endless, mutual, conjugal, impassion and 
its enrichment - the self-content bliss of monogamy.

Shlok 26b- 27a: Seetha has become the beloved of Rama as she is wedded with the assent of his father Dasharatha, further Rama's love for 
Seetha burgeoned by virtue of Seetha's own virtues and loveliness. [1-77-26b, 27a]

[Commentary] Here the good old saying atiruupavatii siitaa - atimuurkhaH ca raavaNaH 'Seetha is the greatest beauty, Ravana 
is the highest pigheaded demon...' may be remembered. He loved her for his father's voice / Had given her and approved the 
choice: / He loved her for each charm she wore / And her sweet virtues more and more. - Griffith.

Shlok 27b- 28a: Even Rama as her husband made his mark in Seetha's heart twice as good, and they both used to clearly converse about their 
thoughts in their heart of hearts, just by their hearts. [1-77-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b: In her mien Seetha is identical with goddesses, and she is like personified Goddess Lakshmi, thus she is the reshaped Divine 
Prosperity, and as she hails from Holy Mithila she shall be held Holy, and since she is the daughter of Janaka, a loftiest 
sagacious and invincible king, she is sagely and stately, besides being shapely, and she with all these heaps of natural 
traits and characteristics, Seetha is rejoicing the heart of Rama. [1-77-28b, c]

Shlok 29: When passionately conjugated with such a princess from the irreproachable king Janaka, Rama, the son of sagely king Dasharatha, 
has enthusiastically shone forth like the God of Gods and the Efficient Cause, namely Vishnu, when He is together with Goddess 
Lakshmi. [1-77-29]

[Commentary] The 'son of king' suggests that Rama as a prospective king has no paucity for any items of enjoyment. The best 'princess' 
suggests that Seetha is no less than him, but now her prosperity edges on that of Rama, because she has Rama as her husband. 
And how will be their mutual affection and love? Many more pages can be written on it, but insufficiently, and perhaps inefficiently. 
This stanza from a romantic work maalatii maadhaviiyam will say how such a love would be:
liinena prati bimbite iva 
likhite utkiirNaruupeva ca | pratyupteva ca vajralepaghaTite ivaantarnikhaateva ca | saa naH cetasi kiilitena vishikhaiH 
ceto bhuvaH pancabhiH | cintaasantatitantujaalena nibiDasyuuteva lagnaa priyaa || 'my darling is 
immersed in my heart as sugar merges in milk, as the Red oleander reflects in a prism, as a portrait painted on canvas, 
as a picture carved on a stone tablet, as a gem studded in a ring, as bedaubed skin-cream, and as though the five darts 
of Love-god are nailed fixedly, [which darts usually will be in a touch-and-go fashion,] and as though stringed with thought-strings 
of my heartstrings, that are the halters with fastness...'

AYODHYA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------

[Text] Valmiki describes the innumerable virtues of Sree Rama in this sarga. Dasaratha
wants to coronate Rama as the crown prince with the approval of all his people. With this end in
mind, he invites various citizens, important people from all cities and villages in his
kingdom.

Shlok 1: Bharatha, while going to his maternal uncle's house, has taken his brother Satrughna
(he who has no sins and who annihilates his enemies) along with him with love.

Shlok 2: Treated with good hospitality and paternal love by his maternal uncle, Yudhajit, who
was a lord of cavalry, Bharatha stayed with his brother there.

Shlok 3: Those heroes of valour Bharatha and Satrughna, though staying there enjoying all the
comforts, were remembering their age old father.

Shlok 4: The mighty Dasaratha was also often remembering his sons Bharatha and Satrughna who
were out of his state and who were equivalent to Indra and Varuna.

Shlok 5: Dasaratha was bestowing his equal love to all his four sons who were best among men,
as though they were his four hands emerging out of his own body.

Shlok 6: Rama, like the Brahma among all the living beings, the most virtuous among those
brothers and the mightiest was a great source of joy for his father.

Shlok 7: That Rama - was He not the eternal Vishnu who was born on earth as prayed by
celestials to kill the egoistic Ravana?

Shlok 8: Like Adithi by Indra, best among the celestials, Kausalya shone by her son Rama, the
mighty.

Shlok 9: Rama was beautiful in form, a hero of valor and without envy. By virtues, he was
like Dasaratha. In this way, he was an incomparable son on earth.

Shlok 10: That Rama was always peaceful in mind and spoke softly. He did not react even to the hard
words spoken by others.

Shlok 11: That Rama, because of his good bent of mind, feels glad even by whatever way a good
thing is done to him. He does not remember any number of bad things done to him.

Shlok 12: Whenever he finds some time even while practising archery, Rama used to converse
with elderly people, elder by way of conduct or wisdom or age or with good- natured people.

Shlok 13: Rama was a wise man. He used to speak sweetly. He was the first man to initiate a
talk. His speech was compassionate. He was valorous. But he was not arrogant of his mighty
valor.

Shlok 14: He did not speak untruth. He was all knowing. He used to be receptive and worshipful
to the elders. People used to love him and he used to love the people.

Shlok 15: He had compassion. He conquered anger. He used to be receptive and worshipful to the
wise. He had mercy towards the meek. He knew what was to be done. He had always self-control. He
was clean (in conduct).

Shlok 16: That Rama, having an attitude suitable for his social rank, giving due respect to
righteousness of warrior-class, believed that by following the righteousness he would attain great
fame and through it the fruit of heaven.

Shlok 17: Rama was not interested in actions, which were not beneficial. He was a scholar. He
had no taste in tales opposing righteousness. Like vachaspathi, his eloquent speech contained a
series of strategies for action.

Shlok 18: Rama was a young man without any disease. He was a good speaker. He had a good body.
He knew both time and place. He could grasp the essence of men. He was the one gentleman born on
earth.

Shlok 19: People loved the virtuous prince Rama and treated him as their spirit moving
outside.

Shlok 20: After completing his education properly, Rama, after knowing the veda along with vedanga-s
as prescribed, became better than his father in the use of bow and arrows.

truth. He was straightforward. He was properly trained by elderly brahmana-s those who knew
righteousness.

Shlok 22: Rama knew the real form of desire, wealth and righteousness. He had a good memory
power. He had a spontaneous wisdom. He had skills in arranging customs useful to society prevalent
at that time.

Shlok 23: Rama was humble. He did not let his feelings appear outwardly. He kept his thoughts
to himself. He helped others. His anger and pleasure were not wasteful. He knew when to give and
when not to give.

Shlok 24: Rama had a firm devotion and steadfast mind. He was not stubborn nor did he speak
evil words. He was free from idleness and was ever alert. He recognized his own errors and those of
others.

Shlok 25: Rama knew the theory and practice of sciences. He understood the differences among
men. He could judiciously discriminate whom to protect and whom to punish.

Shlok 26: He identified good men and protected them. He knew the people worthy of reprimand.
He knew the ways and means of getting income as well as the system of spending, as perceived by
economic sciences.

Shlok 27: Rama could obtain great skill in the groups of sciences along with their
subsidiaries. He was interested in enjoying comforts only after understanding the economy
and virtues. He never remained inactive.

Shlok 28: Rama was acquainted with the fine arts useful for entertainment. He knew how to
distribute the wealth. He was efficient in riding and also taming of elephants and horses.

Shlok 29: Rama was the best of persons knowing the science of archery in the world; and was
well appreciated by the champions of archery. He attained skills in marshalling the army. He faced
and killed the enemies in battle.

Shlok 30: Even enraged celestials and demons could not defeat Rama in battle. He had no
jealousy. He conquered anger. He had no arrogance and envy. He had not even humiliated any living being.
He had not surrendered to time.

Shlok 31: That Prince Rama, with these good virtues, was fair to the people. He was agreeable
to the three worlds. By patience and the related virtues, he was equal to earth, by wisdom to
Brihaspathi and by valor to Devendra.

Shlok 32: Rama, by his virtues, was a source of happiness to all the people and a spring of
joy to his father. As the sun shines with his rays, Rama was shining, thus, with his virtues.

Shlok 33: The earth wished Rama to be her Lord as he was adorned with self -control and norms
of behavior bearing undefeatable valor equal to that of universal lords like Indra.

Shlok 34: Dasaratha, who annihilates enemies, started thinking as follows after observing his
son with his many incomparable virtues.

Shlok 35: The long living and aged Dasaratha thought: "Will Rama become king while I am still
alive? Shall I enjoy that happiness?"

Shlok 36: A great loving thought was ringing in his mind that when he would be able to see his
beloved son Rama crowned as a king.

Shlok 37: "Is not Rama, as a raining cloud to the earth, better liked by people than me, as he
desires the development of the world and has compassion towards all living beings."

Shlok 38: "Rama is equal to Yama and Devendra in valor, to Brihaspati in wisdom and to a
mountain in courage. He is more virtuous also than me."

Shlok 39: "Shall I attain heaven, after seeing in this age, my son ruling the entire
earth?"

Shlok 40-41: Rama had many other virtues beyond hitherto stated virtues not to be seen in other
kings. His virtues cannot be counted and they are the best in the world. Seeing that type of
virtuous Rama, Dasaratha along with his ministers, decided to make Rama the prince.

Shlok 42: The wise Dasaratha observed that there was sign of a great alarm being forecast because
of bad omens found in earth heaven and the sky. He also told the ministers that his body
was getting aged.

Shlok 43: He recognized that if Rama were crowned as king, he would not have worries as Rama
had beautiful face as a full moon; was a great wise man; and was liked by the people.

Shlok 44: The righteous Dasaratha was hurried with concern in the coronation of Rama as it is
for his own benefit and for the benefit of people. Because it is as per his liking and also as the
appropriate time has come.

Shlok 45: Dasaratha called for other kings and officers staying in various cities and villages
in his kingdom separately.

Shlok 46: The hurried Dasaratha did not call for the king Kekaya, the maternal uncle of
Bharatha or the King Janaka as he thought they both could hear the good news even afterwards.

Shlok 47: The king Dasaratha presented them suitably with houses and jewelry. Duly adorned
himself, he looked after them in the manner Lord Brahma looks after his children.

Shlok 48: All the invited kings, duly liked by their people, entered the assembly after the
king Dasaratha , who annihilates the opponent's army, occupied his seat.

Shlok 49: The kings thus entered, occupied their various seats allotted to them by the king,
by facing toward the king as per the prescribed rules.

Shlok 50: Surrounded by the respected and humble kings sitting closely to him as well as the
important heads of cities and villages, king Dasaratha shone like lord Devendra surrounded by
celestials.



SARGA 2
------------------------------

[Text] Dasaratha mentions his desire about coronation of Rama before the assembly of
people. All people in the assembly unanimously and delightfully accept it while describing all of
Rama's virtues.

Shlok 1: Addressing invited gathering in the court, Dasaratha spoke in friendly, pleasing and
clear terms.

Shlok 2-3: In a loud voice resembling that of a kettle-drum, resounding the air like a
thundering cloud and in a sweet splendid and incomparable voice endowed with the characteristics of
a king's voice, King Dasaratha the lord of men spoke to the kings as follows:

Shlok 4: "It is well known that my excellent kingdom was ruled by my ancestral kings as if it
were their son."

Shlok 5: "I have a desire that this entire land which was protected by the descendents of
Ikshvaaku dynasty, be bestowed with goodness and the resultant happiness."

Shlok 6: "Following the path established by my ancestors, I have always protected my people
with alertness and to the best of my ability."

Shlok 7: "In conducting the kingdom for benefit of the entire people, my body became impaired
under shade of the white umbrella."

Shlok 8: "This body has been living for many thousands of years. Hence I desire rest."

Shlok 9: "This burden of worldly righteousness is very heavy. This can be sustained only by
royal power with qualities like courage and valor. A person who has no control of senses can not
carry this burden. I have become tired while carrying this burden of righteousness. "

Shlok 10: "I desire to take rest, entrusting the rule to my son for the benefit of the people,
after obtaining consent from all those best Brahmans who are close to me."

Shlok 11: "My eldest son Rama is equal to Devendra in valor. He is the conqueror of cities of
enemies. He is equal to me in all qualities."

Shlok 12: "Joyfully, I shall appoint Rama, who shines like the moon together with Pushya star,
who is the best among the protectors of righteousness and who is an excellent man, to the realm of
prince."

Shlok 13: "If Rama becomes the lord, the three worlds also will have the best master. He is a
glorious man. That Rama is the only fittest lord for the kingdom."

Shlok 14: "By entrusting this kingdom to Rama, I shall be thus doing an immediate good and
shall be devoid of difficulties."

Shlok 15: "I am telling this after lot of thinking. Give consent to me if you feel this to be
good and befitting. How else shall I do it?"

Shlok 16: "This is my desire. Yet, let there be thinking on any other beneficial way. Thinking
by impartial neutral people will be distinctive and well developed through grinding of opposing
views."

Shlok 17: Those delighted kings complimented king Dasaratha so speaking with a loud applause
as the peacocks cry in delight when they see the raining great cloud.

Shlok 18: That building appeared trembling by the sweet and reverberating sound made by the
gathering of people there with their fond uproar.

Shlok 19-20: After understanding the opinion of King Dasaratha, who knew the holy and worldly
matters, the Brahmans, important people, urban and rural citizens came to a consensus after
discussing together and told the aged king as follows.

Shlok 21: "Oh king! You are an elderly person with thousands of years of age. Hence,
inaugurate Rama as the ruling prince."

Shlok 22: "All of us want to see Rama, with long arms, the hero with great might born in the
clan of Raghu , his face protected by a white umbrella, moving on a great elephant."

Shlok 23: King Dasaratha, after hearing their words, spoke as follows as though he did not
know their mind earlier and sought to know their true intention.

Shlok 24: "Oh kings, I have a doubt as to why you want Raghava to be the king immediately
after hearing my words. Inform your real opinion in this matter."

Shlok 25: "Why do you desire to see my son as the prince, when I am ruling this earth with
righteousness?"

Shlok 26: Those kings together with urban and rural citizens after hearing those words spoke
to the great soul Dasaratha as follows: "Oh king! Your son Rama has many auspicious virtues".

Shlok 27: "Oh king! We shall tell you now the various virtues of your wise son, listen to
them. His qualities are equal to those of celestials. They are liked by all. They give happiness to
all."

Shlok 28: "Oh king! Rama is equal to Devendra in heavenly qualities. He has true valor. He is
greater than all the kings born in Ikshvaaku clan."

Shlok 29: "Rama is the world renowned gentleman. He is keenly interested in truth and
righteousness. Only Rama can make both righteousness and wealth combine without separation."

Shlok 30: "He is equal to moon in making the people happy; equal to the earth in the quality
of forgiveness; equal to Brihaspati in wisdom and verily to Devendra in valour."

Shlok 31: "Rama knows all righteousness. He is true to his word and has good character. He has
no envy. He has patience. He consoles those who are in troubles. He speaks good words. He has
gratitude. He keeps senses under control."

Shlok 32-33: "Rama is soft natured; has stable mind, always an auspicious man, and has no envy.
He speaks truthful and loving words to all living beings. He worships aged Brahmans endued with the
knowledge of various sciences. By that, his name, glory and splendor are growing in this
world."

Shlok 34: "He is skilled in the use of various weapons known to celestials, demons and men. He
has duly concluded his vow of studying the various sciences and has systematically learnt all the
Vedas along with its branches. *"

[Commentary] * Branches of Vedas: - (six in number): 1.Siksha or phonetics 2.Vyakarana or
Grammar 3. Chandas or Prosody 4. Nirukta or Etymology 5. Jyautisha or Astronomy 6. Kalpa or the
branch of knowledge prescribing the ritual and giving rules for the ceremonial or sacrificial
acts.

Shlok 35: "Rama is best in the world in the art of music. He has best relatives. He is gentle.
He is not weak in mind. He has great wisdom."

Shlok 36: "Rama was trained in all matters from the best of Brahmans skilled in the art of
righteousness and in the science of political economy. If it is necessary to go to a battle to
protect a village or a city, Rama goes with Lakshmana and returns home only after obtaining
victory."

Shlok 37-38: "After returning from battle, Rama goes to citizens on an elephant or a chariot and
inquires about their well being as though they were his own kinsmen, like a father does to his
sons. He asks about their wives and children, about the sacred fires, about their servants and
students, always completely as per the due order."

Shlok 39: "Rama the best among men always asks us interrogatively thus: 'Are your disciples serving you by keenly
performing their actions?' "

Shlok 40: "Rama feels very sad towards afflictions of men; and feels delighted in all
functions celebrated by people on the occasions of child birth and the like, just as their own
father does."

Shlok 41: "Rama speaks only truth. He is a great hero. He serves elders. He kept the senses
under control. Rama, who talks smilingly, protects righteousness in all ways."

Shlok 42: "Rama duly procures beneficent deeds. He is not interested in wrangling talks. He is
an orator like Brihaspati by his replies and rejoinders."

Shlok 43: "Rama, who enchants the world, has beautiful eyebrows. He has red and broad eyes. He
is absolutely like the God Vishnu himself in strength, heroism and valour."

Shlok 44: "He knew the ins and outs of public administration. His senses are not afflicted by
passion. He is capable of administering not only earth, but also the three worlds."

Shlok 45: "Rama's anger or mercy is not arbitrary at any time. He kills those who are to be
slain as per rules. He is not angered at the innocent."

Shlok 46- 47: "He gladly bestows wealth to those with whom he is satisfied. As the sun shines by
his rays, Rama shines by his qualities that are peaceful, which are enchanting and delightful to
men."

Shlok 48: "All people desire Rama, who is endowed with this wealth of qualities, who has true
valour, who is equal to presiding deities like Devendra, to be their lord."

Shlok 49: "Oh king Dasaratha! Rama is born to you as a son, because of your good fortune, for
the welfare of this world. He has all the virtues befitting of a son, like Kasyapa, the son of
Marichi."

Shlok 50-51: "All people in the state including those in the capital as well as those in the
nearby and in the far off places, pray for long life, health and strength of Rama of reputed
nature."

Shlok 52: "Both young and aged women are praying with a stable mind each morning and evening
to all celestials, for the benefit of renowned Rama."

Shlok 53: "Oh best of kings, Dasaratha ! We shall see Rama adorned with princely kingdom. Your
son Rama has the complexion of a black lotus flower and annihilates all his enemies. Let the wish
of the people be fulfilled by your grace."

Shlok 54: "Oh fulfiller of people's desires, Dasaratha! For our benefit, you gladly and
immediately inaugurate your son Rama, who is equal to Vishnu, who is interested in the welfare of
the entire world and who is possessing the best of virtues."



SARGA 3
------------------------------

[Text] Dasaratha, glad after hearing the words of assembled people, requests Vasishta and
Vamadeva to start arrangements for the anointing ceremony of Rama. Vasishta and Vamadeva order the
officers present there to make all arrangements, describing them in detail. Dasaratha then orders
Sumantra to bring Rama to the assembly. After letting Rama know of his desire, Dasaratha then
advises Rama on how to rule the kingdom for the benefit of the people.

Shlok 1: King Dasaratha, accepted their salutations with folded hands resembling lotus buds
and spoke good and agreeable words to them as follows:-

Shlok 2: "Oh! I am very much pleased and incomparable is my fortune in that you desire my
beloved elder son to be anointed as prince. "

Shlok 3: King Dasaratha, thus duly returning the honor done by them, spoke while they were
listening, to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other Brahmans as follows:

Shlok 4: "This is the glorious and auspicious month of Chaitra, in which the forests bloom
with flowers. Let all arrangements be made for the coronation of Rama as prince." While these words
of the king were being completed, there was a great delightful uproar of the people.

Shlok 5: When their applause gradually subsided, King Dasaratha spoke the following words to
the best of sages, Vasishta.

Shlok 6: "Oh Divine Vasishta! Be pleased to order now for the traditional ceremonial that is
to be done and various accessories needed for the anointing ceremony of Rama."

Shlok 7: Vasishta, the best of Brahmans, hearing the words of king Dasaratha, ordered the
officers who stood there with folded hands before the king, as follows: -

Shlok 8-9-10-11: "Gather the following in the sacred fire house of the king at dawn: gold and the
like, diamonds, things needed to perform worship, various herbs, white floral garlands, corn, honey
and clarified butter in separate vessels, new clothes, chariot, all weapons, the four divisions of
army, an elephant with auspicious signs, white fan, flag staff, white umbrella, one hundred golden
pots with brilliant shine, bull with gilded horns and a complete tiger skin".

Shlok 12-13: "If any other small things are required, arrange for all of them. Let the doorways
of the royal palace and those of the entire city be worshipped with sandalwood paste, floral
garlands and good smelling incense."

Shlok 14: "Let fine rice of good quality with milk and yogurt, fully sufficient for one
hundred thousand Brahmans be arranged."

Shlok 15: "Let that rice be given with due respect to important Brahmans tomorrow at dawn;
along with clarified butter, yogurt, corn, and lot of gifts."

Shlok 16: "There will be an invocation for the well being of all, tomorrow at sun rise. Let
brahmanas be invited and suitable seats be arranged for them."

Shlok 17: "Let the flags be hung and the royal highways be sprinkled with water. Let well
dressed dancers and musicians wait in second enclosure in the royal compound."

Shlok 18: "As worshipping is to be done in temples and at road junctions, let some deserving
people gather there with rice, eatables, presents and garlands separately."

Shlok 19: "Let all the warriors enter the well developed front yard of the royal palace with
long swords, armors and clean clothing."

Shlok 20: Those wise men Vasishta and Vamadeva attentively ordered for all those things to be
done there, informed that to king Dasaratha and performed the remaining things also.

Shlok 21: Pleased and satisfied with the arrangements made Vasishta and Vamadeva approached
king Dasaratha and told him that all had been done according to his words.

Shlok 22: Afterwards, Dasaratha spoke to Sumantra "Let Rama, who has a disciplined intellect,
be brought by you immediately."

Shlok 23: As commanded by the king, Sumantra brought there, Rama, the best of charioteers, in
a chariot.

Shlok 24-25: Afterwards the kings belonging to east, west, north, south as well as those
belonging to Mlechha kingdom, Aryaa Vartha kingdom and those ruling in hill and forest areas sat
there and attended on King Dasaratha as celestials attended on Devendra.

Shlok 26: The sage king Dasaratha, sitting in the midst of those kings like Devendra in the
middle of the celestials, saw from the palace itself, his son Rama arriving in a chariot.

Shlok 27-28-29: Rama was as beautiful as the king of Gandharvas. His valiance was world famous. He
had great strength and walked like a vigorous elephant. He had long arms, and with his enchanting
face, he looked like the moon. He stole the eyes and minds of the people by his looks, generosity
and virtues. King Dasaratha was thus not satiated enough in seeing Rama, coming like a cloud that
gladdens people by relieving them from the scorching summer heat.

Shlok 30: Sumantra helped Rama to get down from the excellent chariot and with folded hands
followed behind Rama, who approached his father.

Shlok 31: Rama, the best among men, ascended the steps of the palace, which resembled Mount
Kailaasa, along with Sumantra, to see the king Dasaratha.

Shlok 32: Rama with folded hands approached his father, bowed down mentioning his own name and
offered salutations to his father's feet.

Shlok 33: King Dasaratha took into his embrace that beloved son who was standing humbly beside
him with folded hands.

Shlok 34: King Dasaratha gave Rama a great throne, which was high, excellent and beautiful,
decorated with gold and diamonds.

Shlok 35: Rama, occupying that great throne, caused it to shine with his own brightness, just
as the spotless sun in the morning causes Meru mountain to shine with brilliance.

Shlok 36: Rama by his brilliance made that assembly to shine, just as the moon shines the
clear autumnal sky, with the dimless stars and planets.

Shlok 37: King Dasaratha was as delighted in seeing his beloved son, as one delights in seeing
oneself adorned, in a mirror.

Shlok 38: King Dasaratha, the best among those who have sons, smilingly conversed with his
son, and addressed Rama as follows, as Kasyapa does to (his eldest son) Devendra (the ruler of
gods).

Shlok 39: "Oh Rama! You are an exemplary son born to my exemplary elder wife. Being excellent
in virtues, you are beloved son to me."

Shlok 40: "O, Rama! As you with your good qualities cherished these people, you get the
princely kingdom on the day of Pushyami star (when the moon appears in conjunction with the
constellation Pushya).."

Shlok 41: "Oh, son! By nature, you are very humble and virtuous. Even then, because of my
friendship with you, I can tell you this for your benefit."

Shlok 42: "Be even more humble and always keep the senses under control. Leave the bad habits
born out of desire and wrath."

Shlok 43: "Through direct and indirect means, keep ministers and others happy."

Shlok 44-45: "Like the celestials becoming happy after obtaining the nectar, friends of a king
(ruler of earth) are delighted when he fills the granaries and armories to the brim, making the
common people delightful and happy. Hence, you too act like this."

Shlok 46: The well -wishers of Rama, after hearing those words, intending to do good to
Kausalya, immediately came to her and informed the matter to her.

Shlok 47: The best among women, Kausalya gave away gold, cows and different types of diamonds
to those who informed her good news.

Shlok 48: Rama, after offering salutations to king Dasaratha, ascended the chariot and went to
his splendid house after being worshipped by the crowds on the way.

Shlok 49: Having heard those words of the king, seeing their dearest wish gratified, the
citizens took leave of the King Dasaratha and returned to their homes full of joy, in order to give
thanks and render homage to the Gods.



SARGA 4
------------------------------

[Text] Dasaratha decides to coronate Rama as the prince the next day. He asks Sumantra to
bring Rama to his presence once again. After Rama arrives, Dasaratha expresses to Rama his desire
to anoint Rama as a prince the very next day. He cites various bad dreams and inauspicious signs as
the reason for his haste. Rama thus informed by his father, goes to his mother's house and informs
her of the good news. Kausalya becomes delighted at the news and gives Rama her blessings.

Shlok 1-2: After the citizens left, Dasaratha who was efficient in taking decisions pertaining
to place and time of ceremonies, again conferred with the ministers and decided thus: "Tomorrow
will be a day when the constellation of Pushya would be in the ascendant. My son Rama, who has eyes
like red lotus, can be crowned as a prince tomorrow".

Shlok 3: Thereafter, king Dasaratha entered the inner palace and then ordered Sumantra thus,
"Bring Rama again here".

Shlok 4: Obeying the king's words, Sumantra went to Rama's house immediately to bring Rama
once again.

Shlok 5: The doorkeepers informed Rama that Sumantra had come again. Hearing that, Rama was
uncertain as to the reason for Sumantra's arrival again.

Shlok 6: Rama immediately allowed Sumantra inside and spoke these words to him: "Tell me
completely the purpose of your arrival again."

Shlok 7: Hearing those words, Sumantra said: "King Dasaratha wants to see you. Decide
yourself in this matter whether to proceed to your father or otherwise".

Shlok 8: Rama, after hearing Sumantra's words, started immediately and went to the royal
palace to see king Dasaratha, the Lord of people, again.

Shlok 9: Hearing Rama to have arrived, king Dasaratha allowed him to come into the house, to
tell him an excellent and affectionate word.

Shlok 10: The glorious Rama, soon after entering his father's house, saw his father from a
distance and fell prostrate before him in an act of submission, with his palms joined together.

Shlok 11: Dasaratha lifted Rama up and took him into his embrace. Then, he offered a beautiful
seat to Rama and spoke to him as follows:

Shlok 12: "Oh Rama, I have now become aged after living for a long period. I enjoyed all the
luxuries in life, as I desired. I propitiated Gods by performing hundreds of sacrifices, in which
food and lots of fees were given away to the officiating priests. "

Shlok 13: "O Rama, the best of men! You are now born to me as without an equal on earth and as
my beloved child. I had given away lots of donations, I had performed holy rites and I have also
studied Vedas and other Holy Scriptures during my life time."

Shlok 14: "Oh gallant Rama! I also enjoyed all the comforts, as I desired. Thus I am relieved
of all debts to the celestials (by performing holy sacrifices), to the sages (by studying Vedas
etc.), to my ancestors (by begetting you), to the Brahmans (by giving away donations and food) and
to myself (by enjoying all comforts as I desired)."

Shlok 15: "I have no duty other than to anoint you for the crown. Hence, do what I tell
you."

Shlok 16: "Now all the people want you to be the king. Hence, I can install you as
prince."

Shlok 17: "Oh, Rama! It is not only the people's desire, but also these days I am getting
fearful and inauspicious dreams. Here, thunderous comets are falling with great sound, during day
time."

Shlok 18: "Oh, Rama! Astrologers are informing me that fearful planets like Sun, Mars and Rahu
are encroaching my birth star."

Shlok 19: "Whenever such inauspicious signs are produced, the king generally will get either
death or a fearful accident."

Shlok 20: "Oh, Rama! Hence, before my mind gets changed, get you anointed to the crown. Are
not the minds of men unstable?"

Shlok 21: "Today, the moon is entering the constellation known as Punarvasu which comes before
Pushyami star. The astrologers inform that the coronation ceremony can be fixed for tomorrow, when
the moon joins Pushyami star."

Shlok 22: "Hence, get anointed for the crown on the day of Pushyami star. My mind is urging me
as it were to expedite things. O, annihilator of the enemies! I shall anoint you for the princely
kingdom tomorrow."

Shlok 23: "That is why, with self control, you along with your wife should observe fast for
this night from now onwards, and sleep on a couch made of Kusha grass."

Shlok 24: "Generally, there are many obstacles for such type of functions. Hence, your friends
should guard you vigilantly from all directions."

Shlok 25: "It is my opinion that your coronation function should occur, while Bharata is away
from the city."

Shlok 26: " Bharata, your brother, goes according to his eldest brother. He is righteous,
compassionate and has the senses under control. He verily follows the path of good people."

Shlok 27: "Oh, Rama! It is my opinion that minds of men are inconstant. But the ever
righteous, endowed with goodness, sometimes may act unexpectedly on impulse."

Shlok 28: Dasaratha, after telling in this way about the ensuing coronation ceremony scheduled
for the next day, permitted Rama to depart. Rama offered his salutations to his father and went to
his house.

Shlok 29: After hearing the decision of Dasaratha regarding coronation ceremony, Rama entered
his house and by starting immediately, went to his mother's queenly house.

Shlok 30: There, in the queen's worshipping place, Rama saw Kausalya silently in meditation,
wearing silk clothes and praying to goddess Lakshmi.

Shlok 31: Hearing the good news of the coronation ceremony of Rama, Sumitra and Lakshmana came
there even before Seetha was brought.

Shlok 32: At that time, Kausalya closed her eyes and was in meditation. Along with her,
Sumitra, Lakshmana and Seetha were sitting nearby.

Shlok 33: Hearing that her son will be anointed for the princely kingdom on the day of
Pushyami star, Kausalya with controlled breath, was meditating on lord Vishnu.

Shlok 34: Rama approached his mother, even while she was engaged in pious observance, offered
salutation and spoke the following words making her delighted.

Shlok 35: "Oh, mother! My father ordered that I should rule the people. As per his orders,
there will be anointing ceremony to me tomorrow."

Shlok 36: "Seetha too, along with me should observe fast this whole night. The father together
with preceptors and teachers said this to me."

Shlok 37: "Have all the auspicious rites that are required for the ensuing tomorrow's
anointment ceremony, performed to me and to Seetha today."

Shlok 38: Hearing the news of anointment ceremony, which was being desired by her for a long
time, Kausalya spoke to Rama the following sweet words with tears of joy in her eyes.

Shlok 39: "Oh, child Rama! You live a long life! Let your enemies be destroyed! Let the
cousins of mine and of Sumitra be made happy by your glory."

Shlok 40: "O, my little son! You were born to me on a day of an auspicious star. That is why,
your father king Dasaratha was propitiated by your virtues."

Shlok 41: "O, son! My worship to the lotus eyed Lord Vishnu with endurance has become
fruitful. Hence, this glorious kingdom of Ikshvaku dynasty is going to embrace you."

Shlok 42: Rama, after hearing the words spoken by his mother, saw his brother Lakshmana who
was sitting humbly nearby with joined palms and spoke to him smilingly as follows:

Shlok 43: "O, Lakshmana! You rule this earth together with me. This glorious kingdom has
reached you, who are my second conscience."

Shlok 44: "O, Lakshmana! You enjoy the benefits as desired by you and the fruits of kingdom. I
desire to live and even to rule the kingdom but for you."

Shlok 45: Rama, after speaking thus to Lakshmana, offered salutations to both the mothers, got
Seetha to obtain permission from them and went to his house along with Seetha.



SARGA 5
------------------------------

[Text] On the wish of King Dasaratha, Vasishta goes to Rama's palace and asks him to
perform fast that night along with Seetha. Vasishta returns to Dasaratha's palace and informs him
about this. On the way to the king's palace Vasishta observes the festive atmosphere in Ayodhya
anticipating Rama's coronation the next day.

Shlok 1: After Rama left, king Dasaratha called for his family priest Vasishta and spoke to
him as follows about the ensuing anointment ceremony of the next day.

Shlok 2: "O, great sage Vasishta! Please go to the avowed Rama and Seetha today to make them
perform fasting for obtaining prosperity, glory and sovereignty."

Shlok 3- 4: Vasista, who is the best of knowers of Veda, who is expert in mantras, who is firm
in austerities and who is divine, said to Dasaratha : "I agree to it" and personally went to Rama's
house on a chariot which was ready and quite suitable for a Brahman; so as to advise Rama to
undertake a fast (with mantras) performed by Rama, a knower of mantras.

Shlok 5: That great sage reached Rama's house, which was radiant like a dense white cloud and
entered the three gateways of the house by the chariot itself.

Shlok 6: To respect the honorable sage, who arrived, Rama came quickly and hurriedly out of
the house.

Shlok 7: Rama quickly got nearer to Vasishta's chariot and personally helped him to alight
from the chariot.

Shlok 8: That family priest Vasishta seeing that lovable and humble Rama, spoke the following
words, bringing cheerfulness and happiness to him:

Shlok 9: "O, Rama! Your father is delighted with you. You will be getting the princely
kingdom. Hence, you and Seetha perform fasting today."

Shlok 10: "Your father; King Dasaratha is anointing you affectionately for the princely
kingdom tomorrow at dawn; even as king Nahusha has done to Yayati".

Shlok 11: Vasistha thus spoke to Rama and enjoined him to undertake a vow of fasting together
with Seetha, in the accompaniment of mantras.

Shlok 12: Thereafter, Rama worshipped the royal priest Vasistha suitably. Vasistha then got
Rama's permission and left his house.

Shlok 13: Rama spent some time by delightedly talking with friends and having been
congratulated by them in various ways went into his palace after taking leave of them.

Shlok 14: Then, Rama's house was shining, as brilliantly with delighted men and women, as a
lake filled with opened lotuses and visited by innumerable happy birds.

Shlok 15: Vasishta, leaving Rama's house, which seemed like the royal palace, saw the way
filled with people.

Shlok 16: All the royal highways in the city of Ayodhya were filled with groups and groups of
delighted people and became congested.

Shlok 17: Then, on the royal road, the resonance created by the rush of the people, moving
hither and thither like waves, combined with their rejoicing, resounded like the roar of an
ocean.

Shlok 18: On that day, in the city of Ayodhya, all the roads were cleaned and sprinkled with
water. There were rows of trees on both sides of the roads and flags hoisted on houses.

Shlok 19: Then, the people of Ayodhya including children, women and the old-aged were waiting
for sunrise, wishing the anointment ceremony of Rama to happen.

Shlok 20: In Ayodhya, people were enthusiastic to see the great public function, which was
decorative to the community and which would bring forward an increased joy.

Shlok 21: Vasishta, thus seeing the king's way being overcrowded with people, reached the
royal palace slowly by forcing a passage through that crowd.

Shlok 22: He walked up the royal palace, which was akin to the top of a mountain enclosed by a
white cloud and met king Dasaratha in the manner Brihaspati met Devendra.

Shlok 23: Seeing Vasistha had returned, King Dasaratha alighted from his throne and asked him
with regard to his mission. Vasistha informed him that it was accomplished.

Shlok 24: The members of assembly who were sitting along with the king till then, raised in
obeisance to Vasishta from their seats, following the example of the king.

Shlok 25: King Dasaratha, after obtaining permission from Vasishta, left that assembly of men
and entered his palace as a lion enters a mountain cave.

Shlok 26: That palace with women in top dress and form was like the palace of Devendra. By the
entering of King Dasaratha, the palace became more radiant, just as the moon radiates a beautiful
sky with its stars.



SARGA 6
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Valmiki narrates various rituals undertaken by Rama the crown
prince, along with his wife Seetha, on the eve of his anointment ceremony. The festivities in
Ayodhya, the happiness of the people with King Dasaratha's decision to anoint Rama are also
described here. Also, people from different directions arrive in Ayodhya to be there on the grand
occasion.

Shlok 1: After Vasistha left, Rama took bath and meditated on Lord Narayana with undistracted
mind along with his wide-eyed wife, Seetha.

Shlok 2: Taking the vessel with clarified butter on his head as per scriptures, he offered to
Lord Vishnu the clarified butter, by dropping it into the blazing fire.

Shlok 3- 4: Rama ate the remainder of clarified butter after finishing the sacrifice, which he
performed for his own good, silently meditated on Lord Narayana with controlled mind and slept
along with Seetha on a properly laid bed of Kusa grass in a splendid temple of Lord Vishnu. *

[Commentary] * The learned commentators point out that the deity referred to here is no other
than Lord Ranganatha, who had been worshipped by a long line of rulers of Ayodhya as their chosen
deity in a separate shrine built within the precincts of the royal palace. We are told at length in
the Patala Khanda of Padma Purana how Rama so kindly handed over the image to Vibhishana; through
whom it reached Srirangam (near Tiruchirapally) in South India; where it exists even to this day
and is held in the highest reverence by the Vaishnavas and other devotees all over India.

Shlok 5: Rama woke up three hours before dawn and caused to complete the entire decoration of
the house.

Shlok 6: Listening to the pleasing verses of professional reciters, he worshipped the early
sunrise and meditated on Gayatri* with an undistracted mind.

[Commentary] * Gayatri is an ancient meter of twenty-four syllables as a triplet of eight
syllables each (Rigveda iii-62-10: - tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yo nah
prachodayat) addressed to Savitri or the Sun as generator. Gayatri personified is considered as the
mother of the first three classes viz. priestly class, warrior - class and the trader-class in
their capacity of twice born.

Shlok 7: He praised Lord Vishnu by bowing his head before Him. By wearing pure silk clothes,
he got valedictory text recited by Brahmans.

Shlok 8: Their deep and sweet chorus of the valedictory, united with the accompanying musical
instruments, then filled the city of Ayodhya.

Shlok 9: All the people residing in Ayodhya were delighted when they heard that Rama and
Seetha had observed fast for the ensuing anointment ceremony.

Shlok 10: All the citizens decorated the town for coronation function of Rama, soon before
sunrise.

Shlok 11- 12- 13: Banners and colorful flags were hoisted on temples, which looked brilliantly like
the silver lining of cloud, at road junctions, in streets, on big trees situated in temple
compounds, from watching towers at city gates, on shops of wealthy merchants, on buildings of rich
family persons, on all assembly halls and all visible trees.

Shlok 14: From different sides, actors were showing their talents, dancers were performing
dance. Singers were singing and sweet voices were heard, pleasing the minds and ears.

Shlok 15: With Rama's anointment ceremony approaching, people were engaged in mutual
conversations in their houses and at road junctions, about the ceremony.

Shlok 16: Even children playing together before gateways of houses were telling each other,
narratives of Rama's anointment ceremony.

Shlok 17: The citizens made king's road splendid, by sprinkling flowers on it and by making it
good smelling with burning of incense and perfumes, on the occasion of Rama's anointment
ceremony.

Shlok 18: On a doubt of approach of night on completion of the ceremony, they arranged lamps
in the shape of trees to illuminate all the streets.

Shlok 19- 20: All the citizens residing in Ayodhya, having thus decorated the city desiring Rama's
coronation, gathered together in groups at road junctions and in assembly halls, mutually talking
about this matter there and praising king Dasaratha.

Shlok 21: "O! This king Dasaratha, who delights Ikshvaaku dynasty, having known himself that
he became aged, is going to anoint Rama for the kingdom. What a great man he is!"

Shlok 22: "Rama; who has seen the totality of the world is going to become our protector for
long. We have all been blessed by king Dasaratha."

Shlok 23: "Rama is modest, knowledgeable and righteous. He is as compassionate to us as to his
brothers."

Shlok 24: "Let the faultless and righteous king Dasaratha live long! Due to his blessings, we
are going to see Rama as being anointed for the kingdom."

Shlok 25: The villagers, who came from different directions after hearing the news of
coronation ceremony of Rama, listened to the narration of the citizens of Ayodhya.

Shlok 26: The city of Ayodhya was filled with villagers who came from different directions to
see the anointment ceremony of Rama.

Shlok 27: The noise in the city was heard by the groups of those people, while moving here and
there, as the roaring of an impetuous ocean on full moon days.

Shlok 28: That city of Ayodhya equal to the residence of the celestial god Indra, disturbed
with the sound being made all over by the villagers who came with the desire to see the ceremony,
shone like a roaring ocean filled with sea animals.



SARGA 7
------------------------------

[Text] Manthara feels very sad after hearing about anointment of Rama for the princely
kingdom. She tells Kaikeyi about the coronation of Rama. Kaikeyi becomes delighted and gives
Manthara one of her jewels.

Shlok 1: Manthara, a housemaid who was residing with Kaikeyi since her birth, accidentally
ascended the balcony of Kaikeyi's white palace, which resembled the full moon.

Shlok 2: Manthara, from that balcony, saw the entire city of Ayodhya, with all its principal
roads being sprinkled with water and strewn with heaps of flowers.

Shlok 3-4-5-6: Manthara further saw from that balcony the city decorated with the best of flags and
banners. The roads were cleared for uninterrupted traffic. All the people took head-bath. Brahmans
with flowers and sweets in their hands were chanting Mantras. The gateways of temples were white
washed. There were sounds of all musical instruments. The city was filled with rejoicing people and
resounding chant of Vedas. The elephants and horses were also merry. The bulls were making roaring
noise. The highly delighted citizens hoisted rows of flags on their housetops.

Shlok 7: Manthara asked a house maid with bright pleasing eyes and wearing white silk clothes
standing nearby, as follows: -

Shlok 8: "Why is Kausalya giving away money to people so delightfully today in charity,
eventhough she is badly lured of money?"

Shlok 9: "Why are people so happy today? Is the king duly pleased with something, doing any
great act? Tell me."

Shlok 10: That housemaid, bursting with joy, told Manthara in a great gladdening tone about
the great honor to be conferred upon Rama.

Shlok 11: "Tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star, king Dasaratha is going to anoint the
fault-less Rama for the princely kingdom."

Shlok 12: After hearing the words of that maid, Manthara quickly with wrath walked down from
the roof of the palace, which was in the shape of mount Kailasa.

Shlok 13: Manthara of sinful thought; burning with anger, approached Kaikeyi who was lying on
a bed and spoke these words:

Shlok 14: "O, fool! Get up. Why are you sleeping? A dreadful situation is befalling you. A
flood of troubles submerges you. Why are you not knowing this yourself?"

Shlok 15: "Oh, Kaikeyi ! You appear to be a beloved wife for your husband, but in reality he
does not like you. You boast of your fortune. Like the flow of a stream in summer; your fortune is
unsteady".

Shlok 16: Kaikeyi was very much worried after hearing hard words spoken with anger by Manthara
of sinful thoughts.

Shlok 17: Kaikeyi asked the hunch-backed Manthara as follows; "O, Manthara! Are you not safe?
You appear to be very sorrowful with your worried face".

Shlok 18: After hearing Kaikeyi's sweet words, Manthara who was an expert in talking, spoke
with anger.

Shlok 19: That Manthara, who was full of cunning, feigning to be seeking Kaikeyi's welfare,
appeared more worried, and making Kaikeyi sorrowful, spoke the following, to create hostility
between Rama and Kaikeyi.

Shlok 20: "Oh, queen! An unending great ruin has encircled you. King Dasaratha is going to
anoint Rama for the princely kingdom".

Shlok 21: "I am immersed in a bottomless pit of fear. I am in distress and my mind is burning
as if by fire. I hastened here to seek you out."

Shlok 22: "Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes king, his son will become king after him. Thus, Bharata's
name itself will be removed from the royal clan."

Shlok 23: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Having born in a royal family and being an emperor's wife, how is it
that you are not knowing about the cruelty in kingly duties?"

Shlok 24: "Your husband talks about righteousness, but does harm secretly. He says sweet words
but behaves cruelly. Because of your clean thinking; you are not able to know that he is cheating
you thus."

Shlok 25: "Your husband approaches you and talks good words, which are useless. But he passes
on benefit today to Kausalya only."

Shlok 26: "The evil minded Dasaratha sent Bharata to the house of his relatives and at dawn,
is going to install Rama on the throne without hindrance."

Shlok 27: "O, childish one! Like a mother, you wish for his well being. But he is an enemy,
and is called husband for a namesake. He is like a poisonous serpent in your bosom."

Shlok 28: "King Dasaratha has acted towards you and your son today in the same way as an enemy
or a serpent would behave if ignored."

Shlok 29: "O, stupid one! With his untruthful sweet words to you, who are ever deserving of
ease, the evil minded king is installing Rama on the throne and is thus ruining you along with your
son."

Shlok 30: "O, Kaikeyi, of amazing beauty! You have to take timely action immediately, so as to
save yourself, your son and me too."

Shlok 31: Hearing Manthara's words, that Kaikeyi of charming countenance who was lying in bed,
rose from her coach full of delight like unto the crescent moon in autumn.

Shlok 32: That Kaikeyi in the midst of her astonishment and joy gave a graceful jewel to the
hunch-backed Manthara.

Shlok 33: Kaikeyi, the best among women, gave a jewel to Manthara and spoke to her as
follows:

Shlok 34: "Oh, Manthara! You informed much gladdening news to me. What else can I do for you,
who informed such a good news?"

Shlok 35: "I do not see any difference between Rama and Bharata. That is why, I am happy that
Rama is being anointed for crown by the king."

Shlok 36: "O, Manthara! You do merit every favor. I have no other pleasant news than this.
Hence, you cannot ever again inform a better loving news than this. I shall give you a good boon.
Ask for it!"



SARGA 8
------------------------------

[Text] Manthara with her wicked thoughts tries to convince Kaikeyi of the possible
misfortune that could occur to Kaikeyi and her family if Sri Rama becomes the King. Although
Kaikeyi's initial reaction is to praise Rama's qualities; her mind is slowly but surely poisoned by
Manathara's sinful words.

Shlok 1: Manthara, becoming indignant with Kaikeyi, threw down the ornament given to her and
with anger and distress spoke the following words:

Shlok 2: "O, foolish one! Not knowing that you are in the midst of an ocean of trouble, what
is it that you are so delighted about, in a matter to be grieved?"

Shlok 3: "Oh, queen! Though stricken with grief, I mentally laugh at you in that you are
rejoicing at the time when a great calamity is befalling you."

Shlok 4: "I am lamenting over your foolish mind. Does any intelligent woman feel happy over
the prosperity of a stepson who is considered an enemy? Does it not amount to praising a befalling
death?"

Shlok 5: "Rama has a fear about Bharata because Bharata has equal rights over the kingdom. In
thinking about this matter, I am getting anguished. Do we not get disasters from those who are
afraid of us?"

Shlok 6: "Lakshmana, wielding a great bow, joined Rama with all his heart. Shatrughna is as
faithful to Bharata as Lakshmana to Rama".

Shlok 7: "Oh Kaikeyi! In line with even the proximity of birth; the claim to the throne of
Bharata alone can be pressed, that of Lakshmana and Satrughna who are younger is out of
question."

Shlok 8: "Rama is a learned man and a political statesman. His actions are timely and
appropriate. When thinking of your son's calamity to be resulted from Rama, I get shaken with
fear".

Shlok 9: "Kausalya is very fortunate. Brahmans are going to anoint her son for the great
princely kingdom tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star".

Shlok 10: "With folded arms, as a maid-servant, you have to serve that Kausalya who having
reached great prosperity, in the height of joy, will dispose of her adversaries (in the person of
Bharata and yourself)".

Shlok 11: "Thus, if you become Kausalya's servant-maid along with us, your son Bharata will be
Rama's attendant."

Shlok 12: "Rama's wives will get delighted. Your daughters-in-law will be unhappy because of
Bharata's waning position."

[Commentary] Comment: The words 'Rama's wives' here do not indicate that Rama had multiple
wives. Manathara refers to a possible future where Rama being a King would marry other women. It
was a norm then for a king to have more than one wife.

Shlok 13: Hearing Manthara speak thus in many distasteful words, Kaikeyi began to extol Rama's
virtues, saying: -

Shlok 14: "Rama knows all righteousness. Elders trained him. He has a proper gratitude. He
speaks truth. He has a clean conduct. He is the eldest son of king Dasaratha and hence eligible for
the kingdom."

Shlok 15: "The long living Rama will protect his brothers and servants like a father. O, the
hunch backed one! Why are you so pained on hearing about Rama's coronation?"

Shlok 16: "After Rama's rule for one hundred years, Bharata the best among men will certainly
replace Rama on his father's throne, which is that of his ancestors."

Shlok 17: "Oh, Manthara! When we got an occasion for rejoicing as at present and when a
festive occasion is to come off in future (too in the form of Bharata's installation, no matter
even if it comes after a hundred years), why do you feel agonized like this as though burning (with
jealousy)?"

Shlok 18: "For me, Rama is as lovable as Bharata and even more. Is he not doing more service
to me than to Kausalya?"

Shlok 19: "If Rama has kingdom then Bharata has it as well. Rama esteems his brothers just as
his own self."

Shlok 20: Manthara, after hearing Kaikeyi's words, felt very sad and after a long and hot
sigh, spoke to her the following words:

Shlok 21: "On one side, you are getting immersed in an ocean of sorrow filled with misery and
danger. But due to stupidity, you are not able to perceive the truth and you fail to assess your
real position."

Shlok 22: "O,Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes the king, his son will become the king after him in
succession. Thus, Bharata's name itself will be removed from the royal clan."

Shlok 23: "O, Kaikeyi! All the sons of a king will not be crowned for a kingdom. If all are
installed, there will be a great lawlessness."

Shlok 24: "Therefore, kings, O, Kaikeyi of faultless limbs, install their eldest son,
eventhough others may be full of virtues, as their successor to the throne."

Shlok 25: "Oh, Kaikeyi the affectionate one! Your son will be completely distant from comforts
and even from the royal clan; like an orphan."

Shlok 26: "I came here in your interests. But you have not understood me. You think it fit to
give me a present when your step-wife is getting prospered."

Shlok 27: "Rama, ascending the throne without hindrance, will either send away Bharata to some
other country or have him put to death. This is certain."

Shlok 28: "You sent Bharata to his maternal uncle's house even in his childhood. By being
nearer, love is born even on inanimate objects. By sending Bharata to a distant place, you made
Dasaratha to have no affection towards him."

Shlok 29: "Shatrughna was drawn towards Bharata and went along with him. Just as Lakshmana
joined Rama, Shatrughna joined Bharata."

[Commentary] Comment: Sage Valmiki might be implying here that if Shatrughna were to be
present then at Ayodhya, he would have tried for the prosperity of Bharata.

Shlok 30: "We hear that a tree marked down for felling by foresters, when covered by thorny
Ishhiika grass, is saved from this great danger of cutting. So also, Dasaratha might have supported
Bharata if he was staying near to him in Ayodhya."

Shlok 31: "Lakshmana protects Rama. Rama protects Lakshmana. Their brotherly love is as famous
as that of Aswini celestials."

Shlok 32: "Hence, Rama will not do a sinful act of killing Lakshmana. However there is no
doubt that he will do so in the case of Bharata."

Shlok 33: "Hence, I feel that it is better for your son to go to forest directly from his
uncle's house. This is good for you too."

Shlok 34: "If Bharata gets his father's kingdom as per law, it will be beneficial to you and
your side of relatives."

Shlok 35: "Your youthful son, habituated to comforts, is a natural enemy to Rama. How can
Bharata who failed to achieve his purpose live under control of Rama; whose flourishing object has
been realised?"

Shlok 36: "Rama is chasing and bringing down Bharata as a lion chases an elephant-king in
forest. You ought to protect Bharata."

Shlok 37: "Previously, you treated Kausalya with disrespect due to arrogance that you were
fortunate. Will not such Kausalya, your rival wife, revenge for that animosity?"

Shlok 38: "O, Kaikeyi! The day Rama becomes lord of this earth with its great oceans,
mountains and towns; that day you and your Bharata will get a bad and pitiable position of
ignominy."

Shlok 39: "When Rama gets power of the kingdom Bharata will certainly get ruined. Hence, think
of a solution to get your son Bharata the kingdom and to send Rama, your enemy, to exile."



SARGA 9
------------------------------

[Text] This chapter describes Manthara's success in turning Kaikeyi's mind away from good
towards evil.

Shlok 1: After hearing those words, Kaikeyi with her face burning with anger, had a long and
hot sigh and spoke to Manthara as follows:

Shlok 2: "Now itself, I shall send Rama quickly to forest. I shall get Bharata anointed for
princely kingdom immediately."

Shlok 3: "O Manthara! What is the means by which Bharata will get the kingdom but Rama will
not get it by any method. Think about it now."

Shlok 4: After hearing her words, the sinful thinking Manthara, spoke thus to Kaikeyi to
destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom.

Shlok 5: "O Kaikeyi! I am very glad. I shall tell you the means by which your son Bharata
only will get the kingdom. Listen to it!"

Shlok 6: "Oh, Kaikeyi! You desire to hear from me the means for your benefit. Have you
forgotten about it or are you hiding, even if you have remembered it?"

Shlok 7: "O the lady of charms, Kaikeyi! If you desire to hear this from my mouth, I shall
tell you. Listen to me. Let it be acted upon after listening to me."

Shlok 8: After hearing Manthara's words, Kaikeyi slightly rose from the well-laid bed and
spoke the following :

Shlok 9: "O Manthara! Tell me the trick by which Bharata will get the kingdom and Rama will
not get it under any circumstances."

Shlok 10: After hearing Kaikeyi's words, the sinful thinking, hunch backed Manthara, spoke
thus, with an intention to destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom.

Shlok 11-12: "O Queen! Once upon a time, when there was a battle between celestials and demons,
your husband Dasaratha went along with you and other holy kings to help Indra in battle, to a
famous city called Vaijayata in which the demon Timidhvaja lived in a southern direction in the
forest of Dandaka."

Shlok 13: "That great demon famously called shambara, who had several magic effects, defeated
all the celestials and conferred battle upon Devendra."

Shlok 14: "In that great battle, demons approached and forcefully killed men who were injured
by arrows and also those who were sleeping at night."

[Commentary] Comment : It is not a virtuous practice according to scriptures, to kill injured
people and defenceless people sleeping at night. Demons do not follow such scriptures.

Shlok 15: "Then, king Dasaratha fought a great battle there. With their weapons, demons made
into pieces the long armed Dasaratha."

Shlok 16: "O Queen! You saved the life of your unconscious husband by taking him away from the
battle field. There also, you again saved him, when beaten by demons with their weapons."

Shlok 17: "O Kaikeyi with auspicious appearance! Getting delighted, he gave two boons to you.
Then, you said, " I shall ask you whenever I require them". He then agreed to it."

Shlok 18-19: "O Queen! I do not know what had happened there. You yourself told this story
previously to me. I am keeping this in my mind because of my friendship with you. Hence, you have
to stop, by force, the arrangements being made for Rama's coronation."

Shlok 20: "You ask your husband as two boons, anointing Bharata for princely kingdom and
sending Rama to exile for fourteen years."

Shlok 21: If you send Rama to forest for fourteen years, your son Bharata will get intimate
association in the hearts of the people and will get stabilised in kingdom.

Shlok 22: Oh, kaikeyi! Now, enter the room of wrath as if angry with him and lie down on floor
without any spread underneath and wearing soiled clothes.

Shlok 23: As soon as you see Dasaratha, be sorrowful and keep on weeping, without looking at
him and without talking to him face to face.

Shlok 24: You are always dear to your husband. I have no doubt about it. King Dasaratha will
even jump into a fire for your sake.

Shlok 25: The king is not capable of making you angry. He is not even able to see you with
anger. He will give up his life for your love.

Shlok 26: Oh, foolish one! The king will not be able to transgress your word. You realise your
abundant strength.

Shlok 27: King Dasaratha may offer you diamonds, pearls, gold and various other precious
stones. Do not care for them.

Shlok 28: Oh, Kaikeyi, the great fortunate! you remind Dasaratha of those boons given by him
to you in that battle between celestials and demons. See that your benefit does not get
thwarted.

Shlok 29: Dasaratha himself will raise you from the floor and offer you the boon. Thus , after
making him steady, you ask for this boon.

Shlok 30: "Oh, king! send Rama to forest for fourteen years. Let Bharata be made as king of
this earth".

Shlok 31: Rama having been sent to forest for fourteen years, your son will stand firmly,
having laid his roots and will stay in power for the remaining period.

Shlok 32: Oh, Kaikeyi! Ask Dasaratha of sending Rama to forest also as a boon. Thus, your son
will accomplish all the desired benefits.

Shlok 33: Thus , by sending Rama to exile, he will not become amiable to people. Your Bharata
will become king, after the enemies having been annihilated.

Shlok 34: When Rama returns from forest, your wise son will accumulate friends and draw people
to his fold, thus establishing roots himself.

Shlok 35: This is the appropriate time for you. Be fearless and by your insistence, make the
king turn aside his effort to anoint Rama.

Shlok 36: Kaikeyi, being brain-washed an unworthy matter as the most worthy matter by
Manthara, accepted her well and having delighted, spoke to her as follows:-

Shlok 37: Though of right thinking in nature, Kaikeyi was very much surprised to hear
Manthara's words and like a small girl, got into a wrong path.

Shlok 38: Oh, Manthara! You are telling very good things. Till now, I have not recognised you
as this good. You are the best among the hunch-backed on this earth in making intellectual
decisions.

Shlok 39: Oh, Manthara! you always show interest in my well being and wish for my benefit. But
for you, I would not have been aware of the king's intentions.

Shlok 40: There are so many hunch backed persons in the world. Their bodily construction is
very bad. They are crooked and dreadful. But you appear lovely, as a lotus flower bent by
breeze.

Shlok 41: Your chest is appearing equally on both sides and is loftily extended unto the
shoulder. Below it is the stomach with an excellent navel, which is lean as though it is shy of
seeing the loftiness of chest.

Shlok 42: Oh, Manthara! with perfect hips and well rounded breasts and with your face like an
untainted moon you are shining well.

Shlok 43: Oh, Manthara! your waist decorated with golden belt is making sound. Your
leg-muscles are well rounded and your feet are tall.

Shlok 44: Oh, Manthara! you are splendid like a royal swan walking before me, with long thighs
are wearing a silk sari.

Shlok 45: In addition to all those thousand magic effects lying in shambara, the lord of
demons, another further thousands of magic effects are lying in you.

Shlok 46: In your long hunch, which looks like an apex of a chariot, are dwelling your various
thoughts, royal arts and magic effects.

Shlok 47: Oh Manthara! When Rama goes to forest and Bharata gets kingdom, I shall adore this
hunch back with a golden garland.

Shlok 48: Oh, Manthara! After accomplishing the benefit desired by me, I shall, with delight,
get your hunch back anointed with well refined gold of good quality.

Shlok 49: Oh, Manthara! I shall get beautiful ornaments made and for your forehead auspicious
dots of variety done of pure gold.

Shlok 50-51: You will be moving around like an angel, wearing beautiful clothes. You will achieve
an important position in the eyes of your adversaries with pride and with your face, incomparably
competing with moon.

Shlok 52: The hunch backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service, at your
feet, as how as hunch-backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service at your
feet, as how as hunch-backed you are doing it to me.

Shlok 53: Manthara in this way being praised spoke these words to Kaikeyi, who was lying in a
clean couch like a flame of fire upon the sacrificial altar.

Shlok 54: Oh, Kaikeyi the auspicious one! When water has already flown out, there is no use
constructing a dam. Now rise and do this purposeful action. Show your influence to the king.

Shlok 55-56-57: By surrendering to the words of Manthara and having been thus encouraged by her,
Kaikeyi who was of wide eyes, who was proud of her intoxicating beauty, who was a gifted woman and
a queen, removed pearl necklace worth in lacs and other great valuable auspicious ornaments from
her body, entered the chamber of wrath along with Manthara, lied on the floor there like a golden
wire and spoke to Manthara as follows:

Shlok 58: "After Rama's going to the forest, Bharata shall get the kingdom. Or else, you
inform the king that I died here itself".

Shlok 59: Neither gold nor diamonds nor ornaments are of any use to me. on which day Rama gets
anointed for the kingdom, the same day it will be the end of my life.

Shlok 60: Afterwards, that Manthara again spoke to the seriously talking mother of Bharata
that is Kaikeyi the following words which were beneficial to her and not beneficial in relation to
Rama.

Shlok 61: If Rama becomes king, you and your son will be destroyed. Oh, Kaikeyi of auspicious
qualities! Hence you try for coronation of your son, Bharata

Shlok 62: Having thus hit by arrows of words employed by Manthara again and again, Kaikeyi
felt sad, was angry with the king, by keeping hands on her heart, was surprised with the cleverness
of Manthara and praised her time and again.

Shlok 63: If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses or
garlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the loaf here.

Shlok 64: If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses or
garlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the life here.

Shlok 65: Kaikeyi, thus uttering cruel words, having removed all ornaments, lied on the floor
without a mattress like a fallen angel.

Shlok 66: Kaikeyi, having removed all adornments, having her face covered by the darkness of
extreme anger and with her depressed mind, looked like a starless sky in a gloomy night.



SARGA 10
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter, Kaikeyi enters the house of wrath. Dasaratha tries to pacify her
anger.

Shlok 1: Having been thus wrongly preached by that sinful Manthara. Kaikeyi lied down on the
floor as a Kinnara woman beaten by a poisoned arrow.

Shlok 2: The skilful Kaikeyi, after deciding in mind what ought to be done told it all slowly
to Manthara.

Shlok 3: Being stupefied by the words of Manthara, that Kaikeyi became dejected, made firm
resolve, with deep and warm sigh, like a maiden-serpent and thought for that moment about the ways
which can lead to her happiness.

Shlok 4: Manthara, who is Kaikeyi's companion and who is desirous of getting benefit, heard
of Kaikeyi's firm resolve and became very much pleased as if she achieved success.

Shlok 5: Kaikeyi, being angry and well determined, lied down on the floor with eye brows,
knitted in her face.

Shlok 6: Thereafter, she threw away her colourful chaplets and beautiful ornaments on to the
floor.

Shlok 7: Those chaplets and ornaments which were thrown away by her were making the earth
shine, as stars to the sky.

Shlok 8: Tying her single braid of hair tightly over her head and wearing soiled clothes,
that Kaikeyi lying down in the chamber of wrath was looking like a Kinnara woman lying down
dead.

Shlok 9: King Dasaratha ordered for various arrangements to be made for Rama's coronation,
took permission to leave from the elders who were present there and entered his palace.

Shlok 10: king Dasaratha, who kept all activates under his control entered into the inner
chambers to tell the good news of Rama's coronation to Kaikeyi who was a worthy woman to be told
the good news first (thinking that she has not yet heard the news).

Shlok 11: That Dasaratha with vast glory entered Kaikeyi's chambers as moon enters the sky
with white clouds.

Shlok 12-13-14-15-16: King Dasaratha entered his magnificent palace but could not find his beloved kaikeyi
on her best couch there. Peacocks and parrots were being reared in that palace, sounds of birds
like curlews, and swans were heard around. The place was resonant with sounds of musical
instruments. Short and hunch-backed maid-servants were moving here and there. There were bowers
surrounded with creepers and lovely champaka and Ashoka trees. There were painted rooms. There were
altars built with ivory, silver and gold. There were trees yielding flowers and fruits in all
seasons and wells in the middle. There were beautiful seats constructed with ivory, silver and
gold. Various types of food, drinks and snacks were made available. That palace was looking like
heaven with beautifully adorned women.

Shlok 17: Being possessed of power of lust, that king who came with object of sexual pleasure,
was distressed in not finding his beloved wife and enquired the people there.

Shlok 18: In former times, Kaikeyi did not keep away herself at that kind of hour, nor the
king enter her chambers at any time without her presence.

Shlok 19: After entering the house, king Dasaratha enquired with the aid-servants there as
before, without knowing about foolish Kaikeyi who desired to get her selfish ends.

Shlok 20: Then, a female door-keeper fearfully folding her hands in supplication, said: "Oh,
king! The queen ran to her chamber of wrath with much anger".

Shlok 21: That Dasaratha having much disturbed mind already for the absence of Kaikeyi there,
became more dejected after hearing the words of door-keeper.

Shlok 22: King Dasaratha, after seeing Kaikeyi lying down on floor in the chamber of wrath,
became tormented with grief.

Shlok 23-24-25: That Dasaratha, who was sinless, a youthful woman dearer than his life, lying down
on the floor with an intent to do sin. At that time, she was looking like a completely uprooted
creeper, like a fallen angel, like a thrown down Kinnara woman, like an expelled divine dancer
Apsarasa, like a dropped off illusionism and like a female deer tied up in a net.

Shlok 26: That Dasaratha touched Kaikeyi affectionately, as a great elephant in a forest
touches a female elephant which is wounded by poisoned arrow.

Shlok 27: That Dasaratha, possessed with infatuation and having fearful mind, touched that
lotus-eyed woman with his hands and spoke the following words.

Shlok 28: "Oh queen, of auspicious qualities! I do not know that you are angry with me. Who
has cursed or disrespected you? I am pained to see you resting in this way on a dirty floor."

Shlok 29: "when I am here to expend all good to you, why are you hurting my mind by lying down
on the floor like the one who is possessed of a devil."

Shlok 30: "There are so many royal physicians who are skilled and famous on all sides. They
can make you healthy. Tell me your sickness".

Shlok 31: "To whom do you want a favour to be done? who has offended you? Tell me to whom I
have to extend a favour now and to whom I have to do a great offensive act."

Shlok 32-33: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Do not weep and get your body dried up. If you tell, I shall kill a
person who is exempt from death or shall release a person who is worthy to be killed. I shall make
a poor man prosperous or a rich man, destitute".

Shlok 34: "I and all my people are submissive to you. I do not wish to foil even a little of
your intention".

Shlok 35: "Tell me that which is desired by your mind to be achieved even at the cost of my
life. You need not suspect me, as you very well know your authority over me. I keep my oath on my
righteousness that I shall certainly do whatever is liked by you".

Shlok 36-37: My jurisdiction over this earth stretches out as much to the extent as to the extent
a chariot-wheel revolves. Eastern countries, Sindhu, Sauviira and Saurastra countries, as well as
countries in the south, Vanga, Anga, Magadha and Matsya countries, Kasi and Kausala countries are
all full of riches.

Shlok 38: In those countries, gold and grain, sheep and goats and all types of goods are
produced. Oh, Kaikeyi! which of the goods do you want to acquire?

Shlok 39: "Oh, fearful one! why are you exerted like this? oh, beautiful lady? Get up get up!
Oh, Kaikeyi1 Tell me the source of your fear. I shall remove that source as sun sets aside the
mist."

Shlok 40: Consoled by hearing the words of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi intending to tell unkindly words
like Rama's exile was beginning to harass her husband further, by her words.



SARGA 11
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Kaikeyi asks King Dasaratha to fulfill the boons given to her in
earlier times.

Shlok 1: Kaikeyi spoke harsh words to that king, who was struck by cupid's arrows and yielded
to hasty lust.

Shlok 2: "Oh, King! no body has insulted me, nor despised me. But I have a certain, desire
that needs to be fulfilled by you."

Shlok 3: "If you wish to fulfil my desire, you promise to fulfil it. After your promise I
shall inform you that which is desired by me."

Shlok 4: The most majestic and lustful Dasaratha smiled a little and caressingly kept his
hand into her hair and spoke these words to Kaikeyi who was having white smile in her face.

Shlok 5: "Oh, proud woman! Don't you know that there is nobody on this earth more dearer to
me than you except Rama, the best among men."

Shlok 6: "Rama cannot be defeated by enemies. He is a very important person in our family. He
is the supporter of life and a high souled man. I take oath by him. Tell me what is desired by
you".

Shlok 7: "Oh, Kaikeyi ! I can't live even for a moment without seeing Rama. This is certain.
By that Rama, I am taking my oath and promising to fulfill your word".

Shlok 8: "I desire the well being of Rama, the best of men, even at the cost of my life or
the lives of my other sons. I take oath by that Rama and tell you that I shall fulfil your
word."

Shlok 9: "Oh, auspicious lady! My heart is sinking. You raise it by your touch. Oh, Kaikeyi!
you observe all this and tell me that which you think as good."

Shlok 10: "You need not doubt me as you know your authority over me. I am taking oath on my
auspiciousness. I shall do whatever is desired by you."

Shlok 11: That Kaikeyi, who has utmost desire for coronation of Bharata and for sending Rama
to exile, revealing that wish from her mind, uttered unspeakable wordswith bias and delight.

Shlok 12: Kaikeyi, having been delighted with Dasaratha's words, conveyed him of the very
horrible wish in her mind as conveying the news of a suddenly befallen death.

Shlok 13: "Let thirty three celestials with the god of Fire in the forefront hear your words
giving boons to me, preceded by series of your oaths"

Shlok 14-15: "Let your words be heard by sun, moon, sky, planets, day, night, the directions,
universe, earth, celestial musicians, demons, spirits wandering in nights , house-gods and other
spirits."

Shlok 16: "King Dasaratha, who has true promise, who has great valour, who knows righteousness
and who has good equanimity of mind, is giving boon to me. Let the celestials hear it for my
sake."

Shlok 17: Kaikeyi made Dasaratha to hear these words, praised him too much and thereafter
spoke these words to him who was ready to give boons as he was infatuated by lust.

Shlok 18: "Oh, King! Remember what happened in the battle between celestials and demons in the
olden times. There the enemy destroyed almost every thing except your life".

Shlok 19: "Oh, King! There, I saved you. Hence you gave boon to myself who was attentive in
trying to save you."

Shlok 20: "Oh, King! The protection of the Earth, the one who has true promise! I am hunting
for those boons, which were given by you and kept with you for safe custody."

Shlok 21: "You have to give that boon, as per right, to me as promised by you. If you despise
me by not giving it, I should abandon my life now itself".

Shlok 22: Dasaratha, after having thus yielded in full measure to kaikeyi's words, fell into
her trap as a deer, for his self destruction.

Shlok 23: There-afterwards, Kaikeyi spoke these words to Dasaratha who was ready to give boons
and who was infatuated by lust: "Oh, King! the lord of Earth, now only I am asking for those boons
which were given by you then. Listen to my words".

Shlok 24: "All arrangements have been made to undertake Rama's coronation. Let my Bharata
instead be coronated on this occasion itself".

Shlok 25: "Now, the time has arrived for the second boon given by you affectionately then in
the battle between celestials and demons."

Shlok 26: "Rama has to take refuge in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years and let him
become an ascetic wearing rags, deer skin and matted hair".

Shlok 27-28: "Now itself, Bharata has to get rights of succession to kingdom, which is free of
enemies. This is my greatest desire. Now I am asking for the boon given by you in earlier. "

Shlok 29: "Oh King of the Kings, Dasaratha ! Be true to your promise and protect your caste,
character and birth. Are not the ascetics tell that for human beings to get happiness in another
world, they have to speak only the truth."



SARGA 12
------------------------------

[Text] Dasaratha is shocked by the strange wishes of Kaikeyi and tries to convince Kaikeyi of 
her wishes as being harmful. Kaikeyi would not heed to the emperor's words.

Shlok 1: After hearing the cruel words of Kaikeyi; King Dasaratha got disturbed and suffered great 
agony for a while.

Shlok 2: "As it a day-dream or confusion of my mind? Or could it be an eclipse of my experience 
or a disease of the mind?"

Shlok 3- 4- 5: Thinking over thus, the king could not make out on the spur of the moment what it was. 
Then, regaining consciousness, he felt tormented by Kaikeyi's words. Distressed and disgusted as a deer 
at the sight of a lioness and seated on the bare floor, he gave forth a long sigh like a highly venomous 
serpent fixed to a charmed spot through magic spells. Uttering words "what a pity!" the angry king fell 
into a swoon once more, his mind infatuated with grief.

Shlok 6: Regaining consciousness after a long time and feeling much distressed and angry; the 
King spoke thus to Kaikeyi, as though consuming her with fire in his eyes

Shlok 7: "Oh cruel woman of wicked conduct inclined to exterminate this race! What wrong has been 
done to you by Rama or by me?"

Shlok 8: "When Rama is treating you in the same way as his mother, why are you bent upon harming 
only him?"

Shlok 9: "By not knowing you as a female snake with fiery poison, you were admitted by me as princess 
in my house for my own self destruction."

Shlok 10: "When all living beings extol the virtues of Rama, for what offence shall I forego my 
beloved son?"

Shlok 11: "For what offence shall I forsake my beloved son; when the entire world of living beings 
extol the virtues of Rama?"

Shlok 12: "Supreme delight comes to me on seeing my eldest son. My very consciousness is lost, 
if I fail to see Rama."

Shlok 13: "The world can exist without the sun, a crop without water. But life cannot continue 
in my body, without Rama."

Shlok 14: "Oh, sinful woman! Enough of it. Let this resolution be given up. I even touch your feet 
with my head. Be gracious to me."

Shlok 15- 16- 17: "Oh, sinful woman! Why this most design has been conceived by you? If you wish to ascertain 
my kindly or unkindly feeling towards Bharata, let it be so. But the observation made by you earlier 
that glorious Rama, who is senior in the practice of virtue is my eldest son as it were, must have been 
uttered in order to coax me or to get service from him."

Shlok 18: "Afflicted with grief by hearing Rama's proposed installation; you are tormenting me 
too much. Possessed by an evil spirit in a lonely house; you are subject to control of another"

Shlok 19: "Oh, queen! In this Ikshhvaaku race, which is rich in good conduct, this very great misfortune 
has appeared, due to which your mind has been perverted

Shlok 20: "Oh, large eyed one! Earlier you have not done anything unreasonable or repugnant to 
me. That is why; I do not believe what has been done by you."

Shlok 21: "Indeed, Rama is on par with the great souled Bharata to you, for many times you were 
telling me stories illustrating this, Oh, young lady!"

Shlok 22: "Oh, timid lady! How do you take delight in banishment for fourteen years of that pious-minded 
and illustrious Rama?"

Shlok 23: "How do you take delight in the sojourn, in a most dreadful forest; of Rama with very 
delicate body and having his self held in piety?"

Shlok 24: "Oh, the fair-eyed one! Why do you take delight in banishment of Rama, who is so pleasing 
to look at and who is so obediently doing service to you?"

Shlok 25: "Rama always is doing service to you more than Bharata does. For that reason also, in 
your case, I do not see any speciality in Bharata."

Shlok 26: In fact, who else other than Rama the best of men could do much more service to you with 
respect, with correct notion and in obedience?"

Shlok 27- 28: "No censure or calumny against Rama can come from the mouth of many of thousands of women 
or from numerous dependents maintained by me. Addressing gently all created beings with clear mind, 
Rama a tiger among men, captivates the people of his kingdom by his kind actions."

Shlok 29: "Rama the valiant, conquers men by virtue, the poor through charity, the elders by service, 
the enemies in battle by his bow."

Shlok 30: "Truthfulness, charity, austerity, sacrifice, purity, straight forwardness, learning, 
service to elders-these firmly established in Rama."

Shlok 31: "Oh, Queen! How do you wish harm to that Rama who is richly endowed with honesty, who 
is equal to god and who is having splendour as of a great sage?"

Shlok 32: "I do not remember an unkind word spoken by Rama, who always speaks kindly words to all. 
As such, how can I for your sake, break unpalatable news to Rama the beloved."

Shlok 33: "What recourse is there for me other than Rama, in whom forgiveness, asceticism, self-denial, 
truthfulness, piety, gratitude and harmlessness towards living beings exist."

Shlok 34: "Oh, Kaikeyi! You ought to bestow mercy to me, and old and miserable man who reached 
his end and is coaxing painfully to you"

Shlok 35: "Whatever can be attained on earth, which has the sea an end, all that I can give you. 
Let not anger take possession of you

Shlok 36: "Oh, Kaikeyi! I fold my hands in salutation to you. I am even touching your feet. Be 
a protector of Rama. Let not unrighteousness lay hold on me in this matter."

Shlok 37- 38: The fierce Kaikeyi again spoke these fiercer words to Dasaratha, who was burning with 
sorrow and was wailing as aforesaid, who had fallen unconscious and was tossing about as he was filled 
with grief, and was praying again and again for being speedily borne across the sea of grief.

Shlok 39: "Oh, Valiant king! Having again boons, if you repent again and again how can you proclaim 
piety on this earth?"

Shlok 40: "Oh, knower of what is right! When many royal saints assemble and converse with you, 
what will be your reply?"

Shlok 41: "Can you say" a wrong was done to Kaikeyi, on whose grace I am living now and who protected 
me earlier?"

Shlok 42: "Oh, King! You having granted boons indeed today, now talk in another way, creating blemish 
on other kings"

Shlok 43: When there was a dispute between a hawk and a pigeon (who were no other than Indra the 
ruler of gods and the god of fire respectively), the ruler of Sibis* gave away his own flesh to the 
bird and king Alarka* by parting with his eyes, attained to the highest destiny.

[Commentary] ** Ruler of Sibi* We are told in our scriptures how in order to put the large-heartedness 
of the king to a test, Indra (the ruler of gods) and Agni (the god of fire) once appeared in his court 
in the disguise of a hawk and a pigeon. Being chased by the hawk, the pigeon which sought the king's 
protection, descended into his lap. The hawk which closely followed it, demanded it back from the king; 
contending that the bird had been allotted to it as its food by providence and the king had no right 
to rob it of its quarry. The king; however was not prepared to forsake the fugitive on any account and 
agreed to part with his own flesh in order to indemnify the hawk. The hawk however out weighed the king's 
flesh every time he chopped it from his body till at last he ascended the scale himself and thus offered 
himself in exchange for the pigeon. **Alarka*=The royal sage Alarka parted with his own eyes in order 
to implement a boon granted by him to a blind Brahmana who asked for the king's eyes in order to have 
his own eyesight restored.

Shlok 44: "The ocean, having given a promise, never crosses its limits. Therefore, bearing in mind 
the previous occurrences do not violate the pledge given by you to me."

Shlok 45: "Oh, the evil-minded! By giving up righteousness and by installing Rama in the kingdom, 
you want to enjoy life with Kausalya forever."

Shlok 46: "Let it be unrighteous or righteous, real or hoax. There should be no change in whatever 
is promised by you for me."

Shlok 47: "If Rama is coroneted, I shall indeed die before your eyes by drinking abundant poison 
now itself in front of you."

Shlok 48: "If I have to see Kausalya, the mother of Rama receiving salutations even for day, death 
is indeed better for me."

Shlok 49: "Oh, King! I swear to you an oath by Bharata and by myself that I will not be pleased 
with anything else other than sending Rama to exile."

Shlok 50: Kaikeyi spoke words of such extent and stopped. She did not further reply to the wailing.

Shlok 51: Hearing Kaikeyi's boons, asking for Rama's exile and Bharata's sovereignty which are 
very much unwelcome, king Dasaratha nevertheless was perturbed for a while and did not move his lips 
towards Kaikeyi.

Shlok 52- 53: He kept gazing with unwinking eyes towards his beloved queen Kaikeyi, who spoke such 
disagreeable words. The king could not become comfortable on hearing that utterance, which was unkindly 
to his heart filling with pain and sorrow and was as terrible as a thunderbolt.

Shlok 54: Reflecting over Kaikeyi's resolve and her terrible swearing, Dasaratha heaved a sigh, 
uttering "Rama" and fell like tree which was cut off.

Shlok 55: Then the king become like mental a mad man who lost his equilibrium like an ailing man 
getting upset and like a serpent losing it's fierceness.

Shlok 56: The king spoke to Kaikeyi in a distressed tone as follows "By whom have you been taught 
this worthless thing which appears to be worthwhile? Like a woman whose mind has been perverted by an 
evil spirit; you are not ashamed to speak to me."

Shlok 57: "In the beginning, I was not knowing your wavery conduct in this way. But now, I am seeing 
it in you. It is perverted."

Shlok 58: "From whom has such fear cropped up in you, so as to seek Bharata to be seated on the 
throne and Rama to stay in the forest?"

Shlok 59: "If you want to do favour to your husband, to the world at large and to Bharata, you 
give up this sinful intention of sending Rama to exile."

Shlok 60: "Oh, cruel! Petty minded woman of sinful resolve and wicked deed! Which grievance or 
offence are you finding in me or in Rama?"

Shlok 61: "With out Rama, Bharata will not in any case take possession of the kingdom of Ayodhya 
as I think him to be stronger in virtue than even Rama."

Shlok 62: "Having uttered the words 'proceed to the forest!' How can I behold the pale face of 
Rama resembling an eclipsed moon?"

Shlok 63- 64: "How can I see that reasonable view of mine, which was well made in consultation with 
friends and decided, being foiled like an army destroyed by enemies? What the kings who came from many 
directions, will speak about me? 'Alas', this king Dasaratha, a fool was ruling this kingdom for such 
a long time!"

Shlok 65: "When many virtuous and learned elders enquire me about Rama, what then shall I tell 
them?"

Shlok 66: "Even if I tell the truth that Rama was sent to forest by me, hard-pressed as I was by 
Kaikeyi, nobody will believe it and think as untruth."

Shlok 67: "What will Kausalya say to me if Rama proceeds to forest? What can I, having done an 
unkind act, reply to her?"

Shlok 68- 69: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Whatever Kausalya, who was always desirous of showing kindness to me, who 
was blessed with a pet son, who speaks kind words and who deserves to be kindly treated, was waiting 
on me like a maid-servant, like a friend, like a wife, like a sister and like a mother. But, for your 
sake, she was never treated kindly by me."

Shlok 70: "That which was done good be me for you, is hurting me now even as a meal taken with 
forbidden sauces fills an ailing person with repentance."

Shlok 71: Being apprehensive of seeing Rama being treated with contempt and his exile to the forest, 
how will Sumitra put faith in me?"

Shlok 72: "Seetha, alas, will hear woefully two unpleasant, of me having befallen to death and 
of Rama seeking refuge in the forest."

Shlok 73: "Alas! Like a Kinnara girl bereft of her partner at the side of Himalayan hill, Seetha 
with her grief will make me lose my life."

Shlok 74: "Seeing Rama dwelling in a great forest and Seetha lamenting, I cannot indeed desire 
to line."

Shlok 75: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Deprived of your husband, you can as such rule the kingdom along with your 
son. It is indeed impossible for me to survive, after Rama's exile"

Shlok 76: "I considered you, a good and virtuous wife as you are, proving to be perpetually bad 
wife, as one, having drunk wine with poison, though possessing an attractive appearance, concludes it 
to be obnoxious."

Shlok 77: "You used to speak to me very consolingly with untruthful gentle words like a deer being 
killed by a hunter after enticing it with melodious sounds."

Shlok 78: "Venerable people gathered in the streets will reproach me who has sold away my son, 
saying that I am as bad as a brahmana who drinks wine. It is certain."

Shlok 79: "Alas! How was distressing and how painful it is that I have to forbear your words! I 
got this type of trouble as an evil consequence earned in a previous life."

Shlok 80: "Like a rope used for hanging up one's neck through ignorance; Oh sinful woman; you have 
been lovingly maintained by me, sinful as I am"

Shlok 81: "Enjoying life with you, I could not recognise you as death. I touched you, like cobra 
touched with hand by a child in a deserted place."

Shlok 82: "This world of living beings is certainly fit to curse me, such as I am; saying that 
Rama the great souled is deprived of fatherly protection by me, the evil-minded."

Shlok 83: Alas! Extremely foolish is king Dasaratha; whose mind is lustful for a woman and sent 
his son to the forest."

Shlok 84: "Emaciated by vow's, by study of Vedas and by service to his preceptors, Rama will indeed 
during the period of enjoyment, again undergo a great hardship."

Shlok 85: "My son Rama is incapable of saying a second word to me to go to forest, he will say 
"Be it so."

Shlok 86: "If Rama does contrary to my command to go to forest, it will be most welcome to me. 
But, Rama the darling would never do so."

Shlok 87: "Rama, who is pure minded; cannot indeed conjecture my way of thinking. Having been told 
to go to the forest, he will say "Be it so."

Shlok 88: "On Rama reaching the forest, Death will take me, who is condemned by all men and unpardonable, 
to the abode of Yama the god of punishment."

Shlok 89: "Rama the foremost among men-having left for the forest and I having been dead, what 
sinful act can you think of the remaining people beloved of me."

Shlok 90: "The queen Kausalya, after losing me, Rama and sons Lakshmana and satrughna, will be 
enable to endure the woes and will follow me to the abode of Yama."

Shlok 91: "Having thrown Kausalya, Sumitra along with three sons and myself into tortures of hell, 
you be happy!."

Shlok 92: "Being abandoned by me and Rama, the Ikshhvaaku dynasty which was eternal, which was 
adorned with qualities, which could not be disturbed, will now be protected by you by bringing disorder."

Shlok 93: "If it becomes agreeable to Bharata to send Rama to exile, let not Bharata do funeral 
rite to me, when life has departed."

Shlok 94- 95: "Alas! My adversary! Oh, vulgar lady, Kaikeyi! Become satisfied with your desires! When 
I am dead consequent on Rama, the foremost of men, having proceeded to forest, you a widow along with 
your son will then rule over the kingdom."

Shlok 96: "You are residing in my house with the designation of a princess. All fame, which is 
unequalled in this world and lasting insult as well as disrespect of men will fall to my share as to 
a perpetrator of sins.

Shlok 97: "How can my beloved son Rama, who was hitherto travelling as a Lord time again in chariots 
elephants and horses, will move on foot in a great forest?"

Shlok 98- 99: How will my sin; in whose dining time; cooks wearing ear-rings used to prepare excellent 
food and drinks trying to finish their work before others actually survive by eating astringent bitter 
and pungent wild foods?"

Shlok 100: "How having worn costly robes, will Rama who is deserving of lasting comforts, be in 
brown-red clothing on this earth?"

Shlok 101: "Whose terrific and thoughtless words are these of one demanding Rama's exile to forest 
and the other of Bharata's consecration as king?"

Shlok 102: "Women of course are deceivers, even occupied with selfishness. Let them be condemned! 
Here, I am not mentioning of all women but of Bharata's mother only."

Shlok 103: "Oh, cruel woman of evil intent; given to pursuit of your selfish ends, you have a settled 
disposition to bring grief to me. What a mischief do you expect through me or through Rama, who is always 
doing benefit to you?"

Shlok 104: "On seeing Rama plunged in adversity fathers leave of their sons and wives too their 
husbands. Not, even the entire world gets exasperated."

Shlok 105: "I, for one, rejoice by seeing that son Rama in the form of a divine boy, adorned with 
ornaments coming in proximity to me. By seeing him again and again, I get rejuvenated."

Shlok 106: "Active life may not be possible even without sun or even Indra (the wielder of thunder 
bolt) not pouring rain. But, my opinion is that not even one will survive, by seeing Rama departing 
from here."

Shlok 107: "I lodged in my house, as one would one's own mortal enemy, you, who seek my destruction 
and are unfriendly. Alas, due to ignorance, a highly venomous female serpent has been held on my lap 
so long and therefore I am undone."

Shlok 108: "Bereft of me as also Rama and Lakshmana, let Bharata along with you, rule over the city 
and the state. After killing your relatives, bring delight to my enemies."

Shlok 109: "Oh, cruel natured! One who has struck a blow in adversity! When you violently utter 
such words now, why the teeth from your mouth have not fallen down, breaking into thousands of pieces?"

Shlok 110: "Rama does not speak a word which is even a little malevolent or unkindly. He does not 
know how to utter harsh words. How indeed are you recounting the faults of Rama, who talks beautifully 
and who is always admired for his virtues"

Shlok 111: "Oh, Kaikeyi, the black guard of Keka dynasty! You may faint away or flare up or perish 
or enter the earth split up into thousands of cracks! I will not act on your word which is very cruel 
and inimical to me."

Shlok 112: "I do not wish the survival of you, who are destructive like a razor, always speaking 
falsely pleasing words, are of evil natured, disastrous to the family, intent upon burning my heart 
along with vitals and repellent to my mind."

Shlok 113: "There is no life to me without my son. How can there be happiness moreover? From whom 
else can there be joy, while I survive? Oh, queen! You ought not to do an unfriendly act to me. I even 
touch your feet. Be gracious to me."

Shlok 114: That king, who has been gripped in the heart his by his wife, who transgressed all bounds 
of decorum, he wailing like a forlorn child and not reaching Kaikeyi's both the feet which were spread 
along, sank down like an ailing man.



SARGA 13
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter, Sage Valmiki describes the bitter agony of Dasaratha on hearing to
the adamant Kaikeyi's words.

Shlok 1-2: Dasaratha was not suitable for such an unfortunate condition nor was he habituated
to such a situation. He was lying down on the floor, as king Yayati who fell down on earth fter
exhausting his merit in the region of heaven. Kaikeyi who was a manifestation of worthlessness who
accomplished her desire, who was fearlessly exhibiting her fearful form, asked for those boons
again in a loud voice, to Dasaratha who was in such a bad mood situation.

Shlok 3: "Oh, king! You always boast yourself, saying "I speak truth. I am persisted in my
promise." Now, why are you objecting to my boon?"

Shlok 4: After thus spoken to by Kaikeyi, Dasaratha became angry, turned out delirious for a
moment and again spoke as follows:

Shlok 5: "Oh, the vulgar one! You, my enemy! You want to be happy after your desire is
fulfilled when Rama the best among men leaves for the forest and when I die thereafter. Alas!"

Shlok 6: "When celestials ask for me about Rama's well-being after I reach heaven, how can I
indeed convince them that he is well obscuringly the actual fact?"

Shlok 7: "If I tell without obscuring the fact that I sent Rama to exile desirous of showing
kindness to Kaikeyi, nobody will believe me."

Shlok 8: "With much effort I, the childless begot the great and powerful Rama as my son. How
can I abandon such Rama?"

Shlok 9: "How can I send away Rama who is valiant and knowledgeable, who has subdued anger,
who has forbearance and who has eyes like lotus-petals".

Shlok 10: "How I can I send Rama, who is dark blue in colour like a blue lotus, who is
long-armed , who is very strong and graceful, to Dandaka forest?"

Shlok 11: "Rama is accustomed to comforts. He is not accustomed to difficulties. How can I
imagine such sensible Rama in a troublesome situation?"

Shlok 13: "Oh, cruel one! One with sinful thoughts! Oh, kaikeyi! why are you planning to do
harm to Rama who is beloved to me and who is truly heroic? I shall certainly get unequalled ill
fame and humiliation in this world".

Shlok 14: While Dasaratha was thus lamenting with his disturbed mind, there was approach of
night with setting of the sun.

Shlok 15: To Dasaratha, who was thus lamenting painfully, the night seemed to be dark even
though it was adorned with charming circular moon.

Shlok 16: The aged Dasaratha was lamenting painfully as though afflicted with a disease, with
lot and hard breaths, having his eyes fixed on the sky.

Shlok 17: "Oh, auspicious night, decorated with stars! do not wish you to do break into a
dawn. Have mercy on me. I pray with folded hands."

Shlok 18: "Otherwise, Oh, Night! Leave away quickly. I do not went to see Kaikeyi, who is
shameless, cruel and for whose reason this great calamity occurred"

Shlok 19: The king spoke like this and beseeched kaikeyi with folded hands. He again spoke
this word to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 20: "Oh, auspicious queen! I am a well conducted man. I am dejected and seeking refuse
in you. I am an old man and especially a king. Be kind to me."

Shlok 21: "Oh, well-hipped one! I hope that whatever I told, has not merged in the sky. Oh!
young woman, be kind to me . You are good-hearted."

Shlok 22: "Oh, queen with dark outer corner of eyes be kind. You your self give my kingdom to
Rama. Thus, you will obtain great fame."

Shlok 23: "Oh, broad hipped, with beautiful face and eyes! do this. It will be pleasing to me,
to Rama, to the world, to priests and to Bharata."

Shlok 24: Hearing the king, who was her pure-hearted husband and who was pitifully lamenting
strangely with red eyes filled with tears, that bad tempered cruel woman did not follow his
words.

Shlok 25: Seeing his discontented wife talking unpleasantly about sending Rama to forest, that
king was distressed, fainted again and fell down unconscious on the floor.

Shlok 26: While the distressed and self-respected king was sighing terribly in the way, that
night came to an end. In the dawn, bards and singers started to awaken him. But the excellent king
prevented them to do.



SARGA 14
------------------------------

[Text] This chapter starts with Kaikeyi's entreaties to the king followed by Dasaratha
disowning her as wife. The night passes and Sumantra comes to wake up the King. Ordered by Kaikeyi
to bring Sri Rama to the king, he goes to Sri Rama to fetch Him.

Shlok 1: That wicked woman spoke these words to Dasaratha, tormented as he was by the anguish
for his son and who was unconscious, tossing about on the floor.

Shlok 2: "What is this? After hearing the promise given to me, you are lying on the floor
dejected as though you had committed a great sin. You ought to keep yourself within bounds of
ethics".

Shlok 3: "People who know what is right, indeed speak of truthfulness as highest virtue. I
too have taken refuge in truth and made you aware of your duty."

Shlok 4: "Oh, king! Having made a promise to a hawk and offering his body to the bird , king
Saibya, the ruler of world obtained the greatest destiny".

Shlok 5: "In that manner, Alarka the glorious man plucking his own eyes, indeed gave
remorselessly, to a brahmana skilled in the Veda, When asked for them."

Shlok 6: "Following ruthfulness, ocean the lord of rivers even at the time of flow-tide, does
not transgress even to a small extent its boundary because of its compliance to truth."

Shlok 7: "Truth is one word and is Brahma. On truth is righteousness established. Truth
indeed is the knowledge imperishable. By truth alone, the supreme being is obtained".

Shlok 8: "O the best among men! firmly adhere to truth, if your mind is fixed on piety. Since
you are a bestower of boons, let my aforesaid prayer be granted.

Shlok 9: "In the matter, yearning righteousness and to concede to my request, send Rama the
son to exile. I am telling to you three times".

Shlok 10: "Oh, the venerable man! If you do not implement our agreement, it means you have
abandoned me. Hence I will give up my life here in front of you".

Shlok 11: Thus compelled by Kaikeyi, who had no uneasiness in her mind, king Dasaratha could
not untie the cord of plighted word that fettered him , any more than Bali could unloose the noose
placed (round his body) by Indra(through his younger brother Vamana in order to deprive him of his
sovereignty of the three worlds).

Shlok 12: Like a bullock throbbing between yoke and the wheel , Dasaratha got agitated in
heart and became pale in his face.

Shlok 13: King Dasaratha, with bedimmed eyes, was unable, as it were, to see. But with
difficulty, he controlled himself by recourse to firmness and spoke to Kaikeyi as follows.

Shlok 14: "Oh, wicked woman! I abandon your hand, which was clasped by me in presence of
nuptial fire, when it was consecrated by sacred recitations as also your son begotten by me along
with yourself".

Shlok 15: "Oh, Queen! the night has gone by, with the return pf rising sun. Elderly people
will certainly quicken me for installation of Rama with the sacred materials procured for the
purpose".

Shlok 16-17: "Oh, woman of vicious conduct! If you obstruct Rama's installation, you including
your son cannot offer me water. Rama will be made to do the offering of water to me, after
death.

Shlok 18: "Having seen people with that joy before, I cannot see them with there happiness
ended, without any merriment and having their faces turned downward in grief".

Shlok 19: While that great souled king was speaking to her as aforesaid, the holy night
endowed with, moon and stars began to become clear into a dawn.

Shlok 20: Kaikeyi of vicious conduct and of skilful talk, filled with anger again spoke these
harsh words to the king.

Shlok 21: " Oh, king ! You are uttering words, which cannot be swallowed easily like in a
painful throat disease. You ought to summon your son Rama here without any delay."

Shlok 22: "You will be the one who discharges duty, by installing my son to this kingdom, by
making Rama to wander in woods and rid me of enemies."

Shlok 23: Impelled again and again by Kaikeyi, like an excellent horse being severely thrashed
with a whip, that king spoke these words to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 24: "I am bound by the ties of morality. I lost my judgement. I wish to see the pious
Rama, my beloved elder son."

Shlok 25-26: Meanwhile, the night began to become clear, with the rising of sun. While the
auspicious, moment united with lunar mansion approaching, the sage Vashishta who is rich in virtues
surrounded by his disciples entered the capital city of Ayodhya briskly, having procured the
requisite materials for Rama's coronation.

Shlok 27-28-29-30: Passing through that city, whose streets were swept and watered decorated with ,
excellent flags, overspread with colourful flowers , made brilliant with various types of garlands,
filled with people of joy, with shops and markets with abundance, filled with lot of festivities,
anxiously waiting for Rama, fumigated on all sides with perfumes of sandalwood , also resembling
Amaravathy city(capital of Indra); the sage Vashishta beheld the excellent, gynaecium filled with
many a number of brahmanas, crowded with citizens and countrymen, looking splendorous with
brahmanas, knowers of sacrificial assembly filled with excellent brahmanas.

Shlok 31: Sage Vashishta, being well pleased of seeing that gynaecium, got past those people
there and , entered it.

Shlok 32: Meanwhile, Vashishta saw Sumantra by name, who was charioteer-cum-minister of
Dasaratha and who had a pleasing appearance coming out of the royal gate.

Shlok 33: That great splendoured Vashishta spoke thus to the learned Sumantra, "Tell the king
quickly, that I have come."

[Commentary] The word "suta" evidently denotes here the son of a kshatriya through a brahmana
wife (his business being that of a bard or a charioteer)-Amarakosa.

Shlok 34-35-36-37-38-39-40-41: "These pitchers filled with holy waters of ganga , gold pitchers with sea water and
an excellent seat with Udambara wood came for the purpose of Rama's installation ceremony. All
types of seeds, fragrant substances and precious stones of various kinds, honey, curd, clarified
butter, parched grains of paddy, blades of Darbha grass, flowers, milk, eight beautiful virgins ,
an elephant in rut, a glorious chariot with four horses, a special kind of sword called Nistrimsa,
an excellent bow , a palanquin with bearers an umbrella resembling the moon , a pair of white
chowries, a golden jug, a white bull with large , humo on its back, an excellent lion with
beautiful mane with large canine teeth, a throne, a tiger skin, fire with ignition , all varieties
of musical instruments,courtesans, women decked with ornaments, teachers, brahmanas, cows, animals
and birds which are sacred, the best of citizens and men of country side, merchants along with
their followers, all these and many other retainers speaking kind words, along with kings stand
waiting for Rama's coronation.

Shlok 42: Hasten the emperor, so that Rama will get the throne when the day gets started at
the auspicious moment of pushya constellation uniting with the moon"

Shlok 43: Hearing these words Vashishta the great souled, Sumantra entered the gynaecium along
with Dasaratha, the tiger among kings.

Shlok 44: The doormen , who were wishing to do kindness to king, could not obstruct Sumantra,
who came before hand who was senior and who was highly esteemed by the king.

Shlok 45: Standing besides the king and ignorant of that situation, Sumantra started praising
the king with very pleasing words.

Shlok 46: Sumantra, standing with joined palms in the gynaecium of the king, eulogised the
king according to the appropriate moment as follows.

Shlok 47: "How the splendid ocean gladdens at the time of sunrise, so do you by nature filled
with delight, gladden us with your delighted mind."

Shlok 48: "At the very hour of sunrise, Matali (Indra's charioteer)praised Indra and the
latter conquered all the demons. In the same manner, I am awakening you."

Shlok 49: "As Vedas along with the knowledge of the limbs of the body guide Lord Brahma (the
creator) who is self born, so am I awakening you now."

[Commentary] Brahma derives his knowledge of objects to be evolved at the beginning of
creation from the Vedas.

Shlok 50: "Even as the sun along with the moon awaken the beautiful earth which sustains the
beings so, am I awakening you."

Shlok 51: "Having dressed suitably for the auspicious ceremony and shining brightly with you
personality, raise up. Oh, Majesty, like the sun from mount Meru."

Shlok 52: "Oh, Dasaratha born in Kakutsa dynasty! May the Gods -Sun and the Moon Shiva and
Kubera, Varuna, Agni and Indra bestow you victory!"

Shlok 58: "Oh, the best of the kings ! The holy night has gone by. Know what has been done and
do what has to be done. All the requirements for Rama's coronation is kept ready" .

Shlok 55: "The venerable Vashishta himself stands waiting at the gate along with brahmanas,
being saluted saluted with joined palms by citizens, village folk and merchants."

Shlok 56-57: "Oh king! Give orders quickly for Rama's coronation ceremony. A kingdom without a
king is like cattle without a herdsman, army without a commander, night without the moon and cows
without a bull."

Shlok 58: King Dasaratha hearing his words which were soothing and meaningful, was surrounded
with grief once more.

Shlok 59: That king who was pious and glorious, having lost joy about his son, looked up with
sorrowful red eyes and spoke those to Sumantra. "You are chopping off my vitals further more, with
your words!."

Shlok 60: Sumantra, after seeing the depressed king and hearing mournful words, joined palms
with salutation and slipped away to a distance from that place.

Shlok 61: Dasaratha could not say any thing himself because of depression. Then, Kaikeyi who
is experienced in fore-thoughts, spoke thus to Sumantra.

Shlok 62: "Oh Sumantra! The king, being smitten by emotional joy in relation to Rama, who
tired of awakening the whole night and got subjected to sleep"

Shlok 63: "Oh, Sumantra! Hence, quickly go and bring the glorious prince Rama. Blessedness to
you! Do not have any hesitation in this matter. "

Shlok 64: "He was thinking of that auspicious occasion in heart and rejoiced. With pleasure,
he set out, by the orders of the king."

Shlok 65: Instigated by her, Sumantra thought that the righteous Rama would come there
certainly for coronation.

Shlok 66: Sumantra thus thinking and dwelling in a great joy, set out with a desire to see the
long armed Rama

Shlok 67: Sumantra coming out of gynaceumwhich looked like a splendid pool in the sea, saw the
gate being congested with throngs of people.

Shlok 68: Afterwards, proceeding further on, he saw near the gate some kings stationed there
and very rich citizens having arrived there.

those kings, who came from different countries.

his own brilliance, shining like the sun and the fulfiller of desires.

of my benefit and prosperity"

porticoes of palaces, sprinkled flowers on him from all sides.

Shlok 38: Women of exquisitely beautiful form standing in palaces and on ground were offering
salutations to Rama with the best words with a desire to please Rama.

Shlok 39: "Oh, Rama, who creates happiness to mother! Have successful journey! Your mother
Kausalya will be certainly delighted to see you obtaining the paternal kingdom."

Shlok 40: Those women thought that Sita, who is dear to Rama's heart, is better woman than all
women.

Shlok 41: "As Rohini star stays together with the moon, Sita having obtained Rama as husband
must have certainly performed a great penance in former times."

Shlok 42: While going through the royal road, Rama heard those pleasant words spoken thus by
women standing in turrets.

Shlok 43: Then, Rama heard the words of people gathered there and also the words variously
pertaining to himself, by citizens.

Shlok 44: "By the king's propitiousness, this Rama today is going to obtain this earth and the
wealthy kingdom. All our desires are going to be fulfilled because Rama will become the ruler."

If he becomes a king none can see dislike and sorrow at any time."

invoking blessings and eulogised by the most excellent instrumentalists, Rama, like Kubera the god
of wealth, went with resounding horses and elephants.

people suitably.

his grandfathers ruled.

Shlok 10: "If we can see Rama going forth in the city after getting coronated today, it is enough 
of eating or other activities."

Shlok 12: Rama, though hearing of these good, words spoken by his friends about himself was passive 
and went in royal route.

Shlok 13: Though Rama became distant, no one could turn back one's eyes and mind from him, the 
best of men.

Shlok 14: All the people blamed the one who did not see Rama and the one who was not seen by Rama. 
Such a person would blame himself of it.

SARGA 18
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Rama arrives at the king's presence. Seeing King disturbed, Rama
becomes grieved and wants to know the cause of king's perturbance. Queen Kaikeyi describes to Rama
about the boons that Dasaratha had given earlier and also her wishes of coronating Bharatha instead
of Rama and sending Rama to Dandaka forest. On listening to these harsh words of Kaikeyi, Rama did
not become sorrowful, but Dasaratha was very much disturbed.

Shlok 1: Rama saw his father sitting on a beautiful seat, but with his face looking
completely parched up and miserable. Kaikeyi was at his side.

Shlok 2: Rama being humble and well composed, first reverentially saluted his father's feet
and then saluted Kaikeyi's feet.

Shlok 3: Dasaratha spoke only one word "Rama!" with his eyes filled with tears and dejected,
being not able to see or to talk any further words.

Shlok 4: Having not seen earlier such a fearful form of his father, even Rama was frightened
as though he seized a snake by his foot.

Shlok 5-6: That king Dasaratha was sighing heavily with senses sans pleasure, emaciated with
grief and anguish, with distressed and agitated mind, like ocean which cannot be perturbed,
becoming perturbed with row of waves, like sun which is eclipsed and who lost lustre like by a sage
who spoke untruth.

Shlok 7: Contemplating over the unimaginable sorrow of the king, he was very much perturbed
as an ocean does on a full moon day.

Shlok 8: The ingenious Rama, who is fond of his father's welfare, anxiously thought : " why
indeed the king is not greeting me in return just today?"

Shlok 9: "At other times, the father, even though angry used to be gracious after seeing me
why today such a father has become weary after seeing me?"

Shlok 10: Rama indeed distressed and afflicted with grief, with lustre faded from his face,
offered his salutation to Kaikeyi and spoke these words.

Shlok 11: "I hope that I have not done anything wrong through ignorance. Tell me why father is
angry with me. You alone propitiate him in my favour."

Shlok 12: "Why my father, who was always affectionate to me, has become displeased? With his
face becoming pale and dejected, he is not talking to me."

Shlok 13: "I hope that either bodily affliction or mental distress is not troubling him. The
object of happiness is indeed difficult to be attained always!"

Shlok 14: "I hope that no bad thing occurred to Bharata, the delightful man to look at or to
Shatrughna, the man of great strength or to my mother. "

Shlok 15: "If our father becomes angry, I do not desire to live even for a moment without
satisfying him or without fulfilling his command."

Shlok 16: "Man sees father as the visible god who is the root cause of one's own coming into
existence and how else can he behave towards him other than like that?"

Shlok 17: "I hope you have not spoken anything which hurt my father's conscience with your
pride and anger."

Shlok 18: "I am asking you why my father got this perturbation, which was not there earlier.
Tell me the true position."

Shlok 19: Thus questioned by the great souled Rama, Kaikeyi fearlessly spoke these words for
her own benefit, without any shame on her part.

Shlok 20: "Oh, Rama! The king is not angry. There is nothing of distress for him. But he has
something in mind which he is not telling from fear."

Shlok 21: "To him, words are not coming off to tell disagreeable utterance to you, the dear
one. He promised me a word. It is to be certainly done by you."

Shlok 22: "Long ago, the king honoured me and gave me a boon. Like a common man, he is
repenting now for having given the boon."

Shlok 23: "This king promised me to give the boon and now he desires to build a dam wastefully
on a place where water has gone away."

Shlok 24: "Oh, Rama! It is known by even wise men, that truth is the root of righteousness.
See that the offended king does not abandon such a truth for your sake."

Shlok 25: "The king is about to mention that truth which may look auspicious or inauspicious
to you. Still, I shall tell you all that, if you shall do it afterwards."

Shlok 26: "If what is spoken by the king does not create unfavourableness in you, I shall then
tell you. This king will not indeed tell you."

Shlok 27: After hearing the words of Kaikeyi, Rama felt painful and spoke thus to her in the
presence of the king.

Shlok 28- 29: "Oh, queen! what a pity! Do not talk like that to me. If father tells me, I shall
jump even in fire. If father, who is a king, who wishes my welfare and who is venerable, commands
me, I shall eat fiery poison and shall sink into an ocean."

Shlok 30: "Oh queen! Tell me the words of the king as desired by him. I even promise to do it.
Rama does not speak two things."

Shlok 31: That vulgar Kaikeyi uttered very cruel words to that Rama, who was committed to
sincerity and speaking of truth.

Shlok 32: "Oh, Rama! During a battle and a great war between celestials and demons long ago, I
protected your father who was pierced by darts. Then, he gave me two boons."

Shlok 33: "Oh, Rama! According to those boons, I asked the king for coronation of Bharata and
for your going to Dandaka forest today itself."

Shlok 34: "Oh, Rama! If you want to make yourself and your father faithful to a promise,
listen to these words of mine.

Shlok 35: "Abide by your father's command. As per his assurance, you have to stay in the
forest for fourteen years."

Shlok 36: "Bharata is to be enthroned with the use of complete collection of materials already
arranged by the king for your sake."

Shlok 37: "You have to leave this coronation function and dwell in the forest of Dandaka for
fourteen years, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide."

Shlok 38: "Let Bharata rule this earth, by residing in Ayodhya filled with various types of
precious thing together with horses, chariots and elephants."

Shlok 39: "For this reason, king Dasaratha who is overwhelmed with sympathy towards you is not
able to see you with his face, afflicted with grief."

Shlok 40: "Oh, Rama! Do as per the words of the king and liberate him by giving your father an
opportunity to maintain the truth."

Shlok 41: Though she was speaking such harsh words, Rama was not affected with sorrow. But the
mighty Dasaratha became highly disturbed, having been afflicted by the calamity occurred to his
son.



SARGA 19
------------------------------

[Text] Rama on hearing the harsh and cruel words of Kaikeyi remains unruffled. He asks
Kaikeyi sorrowfuly about the reason the king did not speak to him directly about the matter. He
then immediately decides to leave for forest after duly saluting the king and Kaikeyi. On the way
to forest He desires to visit his mother and Sita and inform them of his decision.

Shlok 1: Rama the annihilator of enemies heard those harsh and deadly words but was
unruffled. He spoke these words to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 2: "Let it be, as you said it. I shall fulfil the king's promise, go to the forest from
here to reside there, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide."

Shlok 3: "But I want to know why the king, the inviolable and the subduer of enemies, is not
greeting me today as before."

Shlok 4: "Oh, queen! you need not be indignant. I am telling before you that I shall go to
the forest, wearing rags and braided hair. Become delighted well."

Shlok 5: "How can I not do faithfully an action dear to my father, as commanded by him as
well-wisher, venerable man, as person with right conduct and as king."

Shlok 6: "My heart is burning indeed with one sorrowful feeling that king himself has not
informed me about Bharata's coronation."

Shlok 7: "Without being asked, I myself would have gladly offered even Sita with kingdom,
even my life, loved ones and wealth."

Shlok 8: "Being directed by king, who is my father himself, how much more should I tell that
I can give everything to Bharata, duly obeying father's promise to fulfil your beloved desire."

Shlok 9: "That is why, you console him. Why indeed the king is thus slowly shedding tears,
with eyes gazed upon the floor?"

Shlok 10: "Let messengers go now itself on fleet horses to bring Bharata from maternal uncle's
house as per orders of the king."

Shlok 11: "Immediately, I shall go to live in forest of Dandaka for fourteen years, without
reflecting on whether my father's words are right or wrong."

Shlok 12: Hearing Rama's words, Kaikeyi felt glad that he would certainly go and urged him to
make haste at once.

Shlok 13: "Let it be so. Messengers can go on horses having rapid speed, to bring back Bharata
from his maternal uncle's house."

Shlok 14: "But I think it is not quite appropriate for you who are enthusiastic to go to
forest, to delay further."

Shlok 15: "It is nothing but shyness that the king is not able to speak to you. Oh Rama, the
best of men! Do not worry about it."

Shlok 16: "Oh, Rama! Your father will neither take his bath nor eat a meal until you leave the
city for the forest immediately.

Shlok 17: Hearing these words, the king saying "what a pity! How much misery!" was overwhelmed
with sorrow, fainted and fell in that couch adorned with gold.

Shlok 18: Rama lifted up the king and soon got hurried up to leave for the forest he was again
instigated by Kaikeyi as a horse was hit by a whip.

Shlok 19: Rama after hearing that vulgar woman's words, which were harsh and having
consequence, was unruffled and spoke these words to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 20: "Oh queen! I am not concerned with wealth. I want to receive the world hospitable.
Know me as equal to a sage, abiding in righteousness alone."

Shlok 21: "If I have to do whatever action is dearer to my revered father, that action is just
done in all respects even by renouncing life."

Shlok 22: "There is not indeed anything of greater performance of duty than doing service to
father or than doing what he commands."

Shlok 23: "Even if our reverent father does not tell me, I shall reside in the forest, devoid
of people, now for fourteen years as per your word."

Shlok 24: " In the matter of coronation of Bharata, you told Dasaratha and not to me, even
though you had every authority to tell, me directly. By this, it is known that you have not seen
any merit in me. It is certain!"

Shlok 25: " Today itself, I shall go to the forest of Dandaka after bidding, farewell to my
mother and also after consoling Sita."

Shlok 26: "While ruling the kingdom, see that Bharata serves our father well. It is indeed an
age-old practice."

Shlok 27: Dasaratha after hearing Rama's words was hurt very much with grief was unable to
talk and wept loudly.

Shlok 28: That Rama, with great brilliance, came out, after duly offering obeisance to the
feet of his father who was fainted and also to the feet of that vulgar Kaikeyi.

Shlok 29: Rama made circumambulatory salutation to his father as well as Kaikeyi, left that
palace and saw his friends.

Shlok 30: Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, felt very angry with his eyes filled with tears and
accompanied behind Rama.

Shlok 31: Rama did a circumbulatory salutation around the auspicious materials collected for
the propound coronation and having fixed his attention respectfully on them, moved away slowly.

Shlok 32: As Rama was a pleasing personality, he was loved by all the people. The loss of
kingdom could not diminish such a great splendour of Rama as a night cannot diminish the splendour
of the moon.

Shlok 33: In that Rama, who was leaving the kingdom after having decided to go to the forest,
there was no perturbation of mind in him like in an ascetic who is beyond worldly pain and
pleasure.

Shlok 34-35: Rama, the man of great courage, refused fans and umbrella, sent away his friends,
chariot and citizens kept back sorrow in his mind, subdued his senses and entered his mother's
house to inform the unpleasant news.

Shlok 36: The people adjacent to Rama could not visualise any change in the face of Rama who
was dignified and truthful in his words.

Shlok 37: Rama did not lose his natural joy, as an autumnal moon with lofty rays does not lose
its natural splendour.

Shlok 38: Rama with his courageous spirit and of great fame, paying his respects to the people
with his sweet words, went nearer to his mother.

Shlok 39: Lakshmana, who got virtues equal to Rama, who was having great heroic valour and who
was the brother, kept the grief within himself and went along with Rama.

Shlok 40: When Rama entered, Kausalya's palace was filled with great joy. At that time, Rama
did not show any displeasure for the mihlap occurred in truth. He behaved like that because he had
doubted about the possible shock to his friends even of fear of their life, if he showed any
perturabation.



SARGA 20
------------------------------

[Text] Rama approaches his mother Kausalya to inform her of the calamity. Kausalya on
hearing the news, faints. On recovering, she laments in the most grevious tones to Rama.

Shlok 1: While Rama, the best of men was leaving, after offering salutation to his father,
women in the palace were weaping loudly.

Shlok 2: Which Rama, without being told by his father, used to do necessary activities and
protect the entire palace, is about to go to exile now".

Shlok 3: "Rama, since he was born, was showing the same attention to us, as he was showing to
his mother Kausalya."

Shlok 4: "He used to avoid actions which created anger and soothed all those who were angry.
Rama was not furious with those who abused him. Such Rama is going today to exile."

Shlok 5: "Our stupid king by abandoning Rama who was helpful to all beings , is offending all
the beings."

Shlok 6: Thus, all the king consorts while weaping loudly, as cows which lost their Calves,
abused their husband .

Shlok 7: After hearing the terrific distressful crying sounds in the palace, Dasaratha clung
to the seat, with extreme anguish for his son.

Shlok 8: Rama, who was greatly hurt, sighed like an elephant, subdued his senses and went to
his mother's palace along with Lakshmana

Shlok 9: Rama saw a much worshipped old man sitting at the gateway of the house and many
other standing there.

Shlok 10: After seeing Rama, all of them rose quickly and greeted Rama the most triumphant
man, by uttering the words "May you have increased success!"

Shlok 11: Rama crossed the first gate and saw old Brahmanas who were perfect in Vedas and duly
honoured by the king.

Shlok 12: Rama offered salutation to those brahmanas and saw old women and girls, guarding the
gate in the third enclosure.

Shlok 13: Then those women, having been delighted, greeted Rama with good word of success,
quickly entered the house and informed Kausalya about the lovely arrival of Rama .

Shlok 14: At that time, Kausalya having spent the whole night with steadfastness, who
performing worship to Vishnu,at dawn, for the welfare of her son.

Shlok 15: Kausalya, who was interested to practise religious vows regularly was appearing
auspiciously by wearing a white silk sari and gladly performing sacrificial ceremony in a sacred
fire, by reciting vedic hymns.

Shlok 16: Then Rama entered the auspicious mother's apartment and saw his mother performing
sacrificial ceremony in sacred fire there.

Shlok 17-18: There, Rama saw the articles of worship kept ready for the purpose of the sacred
ceremony like curd, unbroken rice, clarified butter, sweet meats, things fit for oblation, fried
grain, garlands made of white flowers, rice boiled in milk, mixture of rice and peas with a few
spices, sacrificial sticks, vessels full of water etc.

Shlok 19: Kausalya, who became lean because of observance of vows, was shining like an angel
with her white silk sari and was satiating gods by presenting to them libations by water.

Shlok 20: By seeing her son who came after a long time and who gave delight to mother,
Kausalya was pleased and approached towards him, like a female horse approaching her young
colt.

Shlok 21: Rama offered salutation to the approaching mother by touching her feet. Then, she
took him into her arms and smelt his head.

Shlok 22: Kausalya spoke these pleasing words affectionately to her son Rama, who was
unassailable by enemies.

Shlok 23: "Obtain long life and glory, as obtained by the aged , the virtuous, the great
souled and the royal sages .Protect the righteousness engrained in your race"

Shlok 24: "Oh,Rama ! King Dasaratha ,your father is a man of true promise. Today itself, you
will be installed as successor to the kingdom by your virtuous father."

Shlok 25: Kausalya asked Rama to take food , but Rama just touched the seat offered by her and
after performing salutation to her, spoke thus to his mother.

Shlok 26: That Rama , being humble in nature , became still modest due to respect for his
mother and was set about to ask her permission before setting forth his journey to Dandaka
forest.

Shlok 27: "Oh,mother! You do not know that a great dismay is approaching now. It brings grief
to you, to Sita and to Lakshmana"

Shlok 28: "I am going to Dandaka forest. Why this seat for me? Time has come for me to sit on
a seat made of Kusha grass."

Shlok 29: "I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, leaving off meat
and living with roots, fruits and honey".

Shlok 30: "The great king is giving to Bharata the succession to kingdom and to me, however,
he is making me a sage to stay in the forest of Dandaka."

Shlok 31: "I have to satisfy with the things existing in the forest and subsist with roots and
fruits in a solitary forest for fourteen years."

Shlok 32: The queen Kausalya fell on the floor all at once like the branch of a tree, cut down
by an axe and as an angel dropping down from heaven.

Shlok 33: Seeing Kausalya who was fit to be free from sorrow, Rama lifted up her, who had
fallen unconsciously on the floor like a plantain tree.

Shlok 34: Rama touched with his hand that miserable Kausalya,whose limbs were covered with
fragrant powder and who rose like a loaded horse from the floor on which it rolled from side to
side.

Shlok 35: Kausalya, who was fit for happiness but was afflicted with grief, spoke thus to Rama
the best of men who was sitting nearby, while Lakshmana was hearing.

Shlok 36: "Oh, Rama! I would not have felt this much grief if I were childless .You are born
only to produce sorrow to me."

Shlok 37: "Oh, son! There is no other grief to a barren woman except the only worry that "I
have no sons".

Shlok 38: "Oh, Rama! I have not seen any happiness or prosperity earlier, while my husband is
in power. I believed that I could see them at last when my son comes to power."

Shlok 39: "I have to hear so many disagreeable words from my fellow-wives who are inferior to
me and who pierce my heart with their words though I am a better and virtuous wife among them."

Shlok 40: "Which one will be more sorrowful to women than this unending and consuming grief
that occurred to me now?"

Shlok 41: "Even when you are near by, I am being rejected. What to tell after you leave for
exile? Death indeed is certain to me."

Shlok 42: "My husband always held me down, without giving me any independence and treat me
equal to or even lower than the servants of Kaikeyi"

Shlok 43: Those who serve me now and those who follow me, will not speak to me, after seeing
Bharata".

Shlok 44: Oh, son! How can I, the miserable one, see the face of Kaikeyi who talks hurtingly
because of her continuous anger."

Shlok 45: "Oh,Rama! I have been waiting for seventeen years after your second birth of thread
ceremony, with the hope that my troubles will disappear at one time or the other."

Shlok 46: Oh, Rama! In this old age, I cannot bear insult from co-wives and this unending
sorrow for a long time.

Shlok 47: "How can I the pitiable one, spend this miserable life without seeing your face
radiating like full moon."

Shlok 48: "You were nourished in vain by me ,the important one by fasts, by meditations, by
various difficult and painful vows ."

Shlok 49: "My heart is not breached, as bank of a great river, struck by new water in monsoon,
by hearing this news.That is why, I feel it is strong."

Shlok 50: "There is no death to me, indeed .I have no place in the abode of god yama who
presides over the spirits of the dead .That is why, Yama is not forcingly carrying me off like a
lion carrying off a wailing antelope."

Shlok 51: "This grief is inserted into my body. Even then, my heart is stable. It has not
broken into pieces and fallen on the floor .It is indeed made of iron. There is no untimely death,
it is certain"

Shlok 52: "I feel bad since all my religious vows, charities, restraints have all gone
waste.The austerity I performed for the sake of of -spring has gone in vain, as a seed sown in a
saline soil."

Shlok 53: "If a man in great distress can get premature death out of his own will, I being
separated from you ,would have attain the glory of the dead now itself like cow without the
calf."

Shlok 54: "Moreover, what is the use of life? Oh, Rama! With your brilliant face shining like
moon! My life is useless without you. I shall accompany you to the forest like a weak cow going
behind it's calf"

Shlok 55: Then, that Kausalya looked at Rama to whom a great calamity has occurred, saw her
son bound by grief and lamented very much in various ways like a kinnara woman.



SARGA 21
------------------------------

[Text] This chapter describes Lakshmana's anger and Rama consoling Lakshmana.

Shlok 1: Lakshmana became dejected and spoke these words, properly befitting for that time, to 
that Rama's mother Kausalya who was thus weeping.

Shlok 2: "Oh, the honoured lady ! I also do not like Rama to be influenced by the words of a woman 
and go to the forest, leaving the prosperous kingdom."

Shlok 3: "The king with perverted mind, of old age, one who is outraged by sensual enjoyments 
and possessed of passion can talk any thing, prompted by Kaikeyi."

Shlok 4: "I can not see any offence or cause for blame in Rama that can expel him from the state 
to the forest."

Shlok 5: I have not seen in this world any person, whether an enemy or an expellee, speaking ill 
of Rama indirectly."

Shlok 6: "Can anybody observing ethicalness, causelessly get rid of a son who is equal to god 
who is honest, who is self-restrained and who is affectionate even towards adversaries?"

Shlok 7: "Which son, knowing royal usage, can agree to the words of this king who is behaving 
as though he got childhood again?"

Shlok 8: "Even before others get to know about this matter, make this dominion your own, with 
my help."

Shlok 9: "Oh, Rama! While I am standing by your side along with a bow, protecting you who are 
standing as God of Death, who is capable of doing too much ?"

Shlok 10: "Oh, Rama, the best of men! If the city of Ayodhya turns against you, I shall make it 
desolate of men with sharp arrows"

Shlok 11: "I shall kill all those who are siding Bharata ,and are favourable to him. Soft person 
indeed gets disgraced!"

Shlok 12: "If our father with an evil mind behaves like our enemy with instigation by Kaikeyi. 
I shall keep him imprisoned with out personal attachment or if necessary, kill him."

Shlok 13: "Even a venerable person is to be punished, if he becomes arrogant, if he does not know 
good and evil actions and if he takes to a wrong route."

Shlok 14: "Oh, Rama, the best of men! On what strength or season has he taken shelter to give away 
this kingdom belonging to you to Kaikeyi?"

Shlok 15: "Oh, Rama the chestiser of enemies! Where is the ability for him to give kingdom to Bharata, 
by making great enmity against you and me "

Shlok 16: "Oh, queen! Really, I am devotedly attached to my brother Rama. I am swearing an oath 
to you by truth by bow, by the act of giving and by the act of sacrifice."

Shlok 17: "Oh, queen! If Rama can enter blazing fire or forest, you make certain that even before, 
I can enter there"

Shlok 18: "I shall alleviate your grief, by showing my valour like the rising sun alleviating darkness 
.Let Rama and yourself see my valour"

Shlok 19: Hearing these words of Lakshmana the magnanimous, Kausalya entirely given up to anguish 
and weaping, spoke thus to Rama.

Shlok 20: "Oh, son !You have heard the words of Lakshmana .If you agree, you do what is to be done, 
immediately."

Shlok 21: "It is not proper for you to go away from here, leaving me afflicted with grief, after 
hearing the un-just words spoken by my co-wife."

Shlok 22: "Oh, Rama! You are righteous man. If you desire to practice virtue, be a virtuous man 
and stay here serving me thereby practicing the best morality in the form of serving your mother.

Shlok 23: "Oh, son! Formerly Kasyapa was staying in his own house itself with self restraint, performed 
great austerity by serving his mother and went to heaven"

Shlok 24: "Just as the king, by respectable feeling to you is worthy of worship, so also being 
your mother, I am worthy of worship to you. Hence, do not go to the forest"

Shlok 25: "After your separation, I shall have no use of this life or comforts for me, it is good 
even to eat grass while staying with you"

Shlok 26: "I shall not live if you leave for the forest, leaving me who is afflicted with grief. 
I shall seek death through starvation"

Shlok 27: "Oh, son! If I fast myself to death for your sake, you will attain the universally famous 
hell, like the god of the ocean obtaining trouble because of his un justice behaviour, towards the sage 
called Pippalada, producing the latter's wrath."

Shlok 28: The honest Rama spoke these virtuous words to his mother Kausalya, who was thus weeping 
miserably.

Shlok 29: "I am not able to violate my father's words. I am bowing my head and asking your favour. 
I shall have to go to the forest"

Shlok 30: "A sage called Kandu, who knew righteousness, who performed religious vows and who was 
a learned man, killed even a cow, acting as per his father's words"

Shlok 31: "Previously, the sons of Sagara belonging to our race, were got bitterly digging up the 
earth, as commanded by their father."

Shlok 32: "Parasu Rama, the son of Jamadagni personally slayed his mother Renuka in the forest 
with an axe as per his father's words."

Shlok 33: "Oh, mother! These and many others who were equivalent to gods, did not make their father' 
s words to go waste. I shall also do what is desired by my father"

Shlok 34: "Oh, mother! I am not the only person to act according to father's command. Those I have 
mentioned to you hitherto also complied with their father's command."

Shlok 35: "I am not setting any new contradicting customary conduct for your sake. I am adhering 
to the way agreed and followed by the ancient."

Shlok 36: "I cannot do otherwise than acting in accordance with father's words, the prevalent practice 
on earth. There is no deprivation indeed for anyone who complies with father's commands."

Shlok 37: Rama, the best of those who speak skilfully and the best of all those wearing the bow, 
spoke thus to his mother and turned round to Lakshmana to speak.

Shlok 38: "Oh, Lakshmana ! I know your highest affection towards me, your heroic valour ,your strength 
and your unassailable splendour ."

Shlok 39: " Oh, Lakshmana, with good attributes! My mother is feeling a great and unequalled sorrow, 
by not knowing the secret of truth and tranquillity."

Shlok 40: "Righteousness is the best of all qualities in the world. Truth is established in righteousness. 
Even these best words of father are enjoined with righteousness."

Shlok 41: "One who follows righteousness, does not waste his promise given to one's father or mother 
or Brahmana."

Shlok 42: " I cannot transgress my father's command. On the word given by my father only, Kaikeyi 
instigated me to go to the forest."

Shlok 43: "Hence, leave this mean mentality of military heroism. Observe righteousness and not 
rudeness. follow my perception."

Shlok 44: Rama spoke thus to his brother affectionately, bowed to his mother and with folded hands, 
spoke again to Kausalya as follows.

Shlok 45: "OH, mother! I have decided to go to forest. Please give me permission. I am swearing 
to you on my life. Please invoke blessings on me."

Shlok 46: "As sage king named Yayati in olden times left the heaven and reached back heaven again, 
I shall be back to the city from the forest, after fulfilling my promise."

Shlok 47: "Oh, mother! Please do not grieve, Bear it well in your heart. I shall come back here 
again from the forest after fulfilling the father's command."

Shlok 48: "You and I, Sita, Lakshmana, Sumintra and all of us should follow father's directions. 
This is an eternal custom."

Shlok 49: "Oh mother! Please approve my righteous intention of going to the forest, duly withdrawing 
preparations for my coronation and keeping in check the sorrow in your heart."

Shlok 50: The mother Kausalya heard the most virtuous, cool and steady words of Rama and rose, 
as though regained consciousness once more after death, looked at Rama and spoke thus again.

Shlok 51: "Oh, son! I am also as respectable a person to you as your father, in my own right and 
due to great affection. I do not give permission to you. You cannot thus go away, leaving me in great 
sorrow."

Shlok 52: "What is the use of my living in this world without you? What is the use of the other 
world or the oblation of food offered to the deceased ancestors or the nectar of immortality? Your proximity 
even for a moment is better than that of the entire world of living beings."

Shlok 53: After hearing the pathetic lamentation of his mother, he was highly anguished, as when 
an elephant is removed highly from its way by men with flames of fire.

Shlok 54: Rama, who was established in righteousness, spoke these words endowed with virtue, to 
his mother who was looking unconscious and to Lakshmana who was disturbed and exhausted with distress. 
He was the only person worthy of speaking thus at that time.

Shlok 55: "Oh, Lakshmana! I always know your devotion towards me as well as your strength. But 
now, you are joining with mother in afflicting much trouble to me without looking at my opinion."

Shlok 56: "Oh, Lakshmana! In obtaining the fruit of good works in the world, righteousness utility 
and free will are being considered. As a wife who is obedient, who is beloved and who is having good 
sons, good work yields all these three things."

Shlok 57: "Only such an action, which is righteous, is to be initiated, leaving that in which wealth, 
desire and righteousness do not come together. One who is intested in wealth alone becomes indeed fit 
to be hated in the world. So also the one whose very essence is desire, cannot indeed be considered 
good.

Shlok 58: "When father, who is venerable, a king and old-aged, commands an action either by anger 
or by extreme joy or by even desire, which right person will not perform it? Only a person who chooses 
to be cruel will not do it."

Shlok 59: "I cannot avoid fulfilling the father's command completely. For both of us, he is an 
important person indeed to command us. To mother Kausalya also, he is the husband, the resource person 
and the personified law."

Shlok 60: "while the righteous king Dasaratha is alive and especially when he is following his 
own righteous path, how the mother Kausalya can go out with me from here leaving the city like other 
widowed woman?"

Shlok 61: "Oh, mother the queen! Permit me to go to forest. As Yayati returned to heaven by the 
power of truth, give me your power of blessings so that I can return here after completion of exile."

Shlok 62: "I cannot keep back reputation and glory for the sake of kingdom alone. This cannot unrighteously 
long for this inferior kingdom."

Shlok 63: Rama, the best of men, decided to go to Dandaka forest fearlessly with his prowess, consoled 
his mother, advised his brother by good thoughts and made hearty circumbulatory salutation to his mother.



SARGA 22
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Rama further tries to pacify Lakshmana and tells him that his stay in 
forest is the will of gods. He also wants all the celebration for his coronation to be stopped.

Shlok 1-2: Afterwards ,the self composed Rama by controlling his thoughts with courage ,approached 
the kind -hearted and affectionate brother Lakshmana who was distressed with agony who was very much 
angry like a hissing king cobra ,with his eyes dilated with wrath and spoke the following words.

Shlok 3-4: " Hold back grief and anger. Forget this insult, by taking refuge in courage alone. Obtain 
great joy! Abandon all these arrangements made today for my coronation and immediately take up action 
that is faultless ."

Shlok 5: "Oh, Lakshmana! Show the same zeal now in terminating my coronation as the zeal shown 
earlier in preparations for my coronation."

Shlok 6: "My mother Kaikeyi is still agonized about my coronation. Behave in such a way that no 
apprehension comes to her mind on this matter."

Shlok 7: "Oh, Lakshmana! I do not wish to disregard the painful doubt in her mind even for a moment".

Shlok 8: "I do not remember to have done even a small disagreeable thing here at any time to my 
mothers or to my father, either intentionally or unintentionally."

Shlok 9: "Let the promise made by my father ,who is truthful, who is truly mighty and who is afraid 
of the fear of the other world, become true .Let him be fearless."

Shlok 10: "Our father will feel anguished that his word has not come true ,if this coronation is 
not withdrawn. His distress will cause pain to me."

Shlok 11: "Oh, Lakshmana for that reason, I wish to go to forest immediately from her, by withdrawing, 
coronation arrangement."

Shlok 12: "Soon after my departure to the forest now, Kaikeyi having accomplished her purpose, 
will coolly get her son coronated."

Shlok 13: "If go to forest , wearing deer -skin rags and with my hair twisted together Kaikeyi 
will have mental peace."

Shlok 14: "I do not want to create trouble to my father, who has taken this hard decision in his 
mind . Hence, I will go to the forest at once

Shlok 15: "Oh, Lakshmana! Look at it as destiny which has taken back kingdom given to me and which 
is sending me to exile"

Shlok 16: -"If not making of destiny to create such a thought in Kaikeyi, how come she resolved 
to harass?"

Shlok 17: "You know that I had no discrimination among mothers and Kaikeyi also in the past had 
no discrimination between me and her son Bharata"

Shlok 18: "I do not perceive any other reason than an accident that made Kaikeyi to abolish my 
coronation , to send me to exile ,and to speak ferocious words ,not to be talked about."

Shlok 19: "If it is for not an accidental reason, how Kaikeyi who is of a perfect temperament and 
who is born in a royal family can tell like a common woman to her husband to create trouble for me ?"

Shlok 20: "The influence of destiny is un imaginable. No living being can counteract its influence. 
An adverse fate has befallen on me and on her .It is clear now ."

Shlok 21: "Oh, Lakshmana! There is no means whatsoever to abstain from it otherwise than to follow 
the course of destiny. Who will be able to fight against the destiny. ?"

Shlok 22: "Pleasure and pain, fear and anger, gain and loss, birth and death and such other things 
are all the acts of destiny"

Shlok 23: "Even sages, who performed sever penance, having been harassed by destiny leave aside 
restraint and get ruined by lust and anger."

Shlok 24: "It is indeed an act of destiny which suddenly and unimaginably obstructs an action, 
undertaken in the world ,at the starting point itself."

Shlok 25: "Although my coronation is obstructed, I have no grief since I have restrained the self 
by myself with real consciousness."

Shlok 26: "Hence ,you also ,like me, get the arrangements for coronation withdrawn immediately 
without any anguish"

Shlok 27: Oh, Lakshmana! Let all these very pots of water arranged for coronation be used by me 
for my bath after completing the religious vow of asceticism."

Shlok 28: "Otherwise ,why to me this water in these pots ,which is royal property? The water drawn 
out by myself ,will be used for my bath after completing the religious vow."

Shlok 29: "Oh, Lakshmana! Do not repent about this perverseness of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. 
When you talk of kingdom or dwelling in the forest, this is the final beautitude."

Shlok 30: "Oh, Lakshmana! Do not suspect our mother for obstruction of coronation ceremony. She 
is uttering evil words, being overpowered by destiny. You are aware of this destiny, which has such 
influence."



SARGA 23
------------------------------

[Text] This chapter describes the valiant words of Lakshmana, his opposing depends on god
and proposes to fight with Rama's enemies to endow Rama with Kingdom.

Shlok 1: While Rama was thus speeding, Lakshmana heard, bowed down his head and got into the
midst of pain and pleasure effecting his mind again and again.

Shlok 2: Lakshmana then firmed up his eyebrows and sighed with frown, like an angry snake
from its hole.

Shlok 3: His wickedly looking face with eyebrows contracted, then appeared like the face of
an angry lion.

Shlok 4: Seeing Rama with the tip of his eyes obliquely, Lakshmana spoke to him moving his
forehand like an elephant moving its trunk and causing his head to fall in oblique and upward
direction.

Shlok 5-6: "Oh, the best of proud military community! This untimely great confusion is born in
you due to your conjecture of quilty righteousness and of non suspicion of the world. Can such a
person like you speak a person like you speak thus doubtlessly of the powerless destiny?"

Shlok 7: "Why are you speaking about this weak and pitiable destiny? Why are you not doubting
the sinful Kaikeyi and Dasaratha?"

Shlok 8: "Oh, the righteous sould! Both of them are smoothly deceiving in the name of
righteousness with an intent to keep away your good conduct, with selfish away your good conduct,
with selfish motive and by dishonest means. You are not knowing."

Shlok 9: "Oh, Rama! If it was not indeed an earlier decision taken long ago by both of them,
the boon must have been given naturally even long ago."

Shlok 10: "Enthroning other than yourself is not to the liking of the people. I cannot
tolerate this act that is started. Excuse me in this matter."

Shlok 11: "Oh, Rama the great minded! This righteousness by which your intellect got disunited
and by which indulgence, you are stupefied, is disliked by me."

Shlok 12: "you are capable of doing retaliatory action. How can you act on the word which is
reprehensible and which is unjustified of your father who is surrendering obediently to the will of
Kaikeyi?"

Shlok 13: "Though they are doing this treachery with a sinful intent, I regret that you are
not grasping it. Such a conduct is to be censured."

Shlok 14: "But of them, action on their own free will, were never desirous of your welfare.
They are enemies in the name of parents. It is not proper even to think of fulfilling their
desire."

Shlok 15: "It may be your opinion that their action is influenced by mere destiny. Even then,
I do not like you to be indifferent to this also."

Shlok 16: "Only a confused and cowardly person depends upon destiny. Brave men with
self-respect do not honour the destiny."

Shlok 17: "That person who is capable of keeping off destiny by human effort, does not have
regret in the sense of not being failed by destiny."

Shlok 18: "Today, all can see how much prowess is there in destiny and in man. This day, the
distinction between man and the destiny will be clearly perceived."

Shlok 19: "By which destiny, your coronation is seen crushed, I shall crush that destiny by my
prowess. Let all people see it!"

Shlok 20: "By my prowess, I shall turn back this destiny, as framing back an elephant which is
not caring a hook and which is fiercely running with violent force."

Shlok 21: "Neither all the guardians of the world nor the three worlds put together can
withhold Rama's coronation today. Why to talk about father."

Shlok 22: "Oh, King! Those who are secritlyadvocating you to live in a forest for fourteen
years, will have to reside in forest for fourteen years in that manner."

Shlok 23: "That is why, I shall break down the hope of father and of Kaikeyi, who is trying
for kingdom to her son by creating obstacle to your coronation."

Shlok 24: "The strength of destiny cannot create that much pain as that which my terrific
prowess will create to those who are opposed to my strength."

Shlok 25: "At the end of a thousand years of your ruling the kingdom, you having gone to the
forest, your sons will govern the kingdom."

Shlok 26: "It is indeed a practice for ancient kings to go to the forest after keeping care of
people, to be nourished as children, into the hands of their sons."

Shlok 27-28: "If you think that you do not want kingdom because of your doubt that the kingdom
will get disturbed due to unstable mind of king Dasaratha, you need not fear. I am promising you. I
shall protect the kingdom as a sea coast protects the sea. If not, I will not obtain the heroic
world of heaven."

Shlok 29: "You become engaged in getting coronated with auspicious things. I for one is
competent to ward off the kings by force."

Shlok 30: "My arms are not meant for handsomeness alone. Bow is not for decoration. Sword is
not for tying around waist. Arrows are not for staying immobile. All these four are intended for
subduing enemies."

Shlok 31-32: "I do not wish to tolerate too much the one who is considered as enemy to me. By
wearing a sword with sharp edge which is mavingly bright like lightening, I do not care any enemy,
even Indra himself. This earth will become impermeable, uninhabited with heads hands and thighs of
elephants horses and men crushed, having been hit by my sword."

Shlok 33: "Now, elephants can fall down on earth, being hit by the gush of my sword, like
mountains in blaze, like clouds, savidyutaH = with flashes of lightening.

Shlok 34: "As I stand holding a bow with fingers wound with shields made of allegator-skin,
how any man will fancy himself a hero among men?"

Shlok 35: "While I overpower one with many arrows and many with a single arrow, I discharge my
arrows at vitals of men, horses and elephants."

Shlok 36: "Oh, Lord! Today, the strength of my excellent arrows is capable of making you
sovereign and making Dasaratha devoid of power."

Shlok 37: " Oh, Lord Rama! Today the effect of my weapons will remove the power from the king
Dasaratha and give the lordship to you."

Shlok 38-39: "Oh, Rama! These arms worthy of wearing sandalwood essence and bracelets; for
bestowing riches and for protection of friends can today do every action to prevent the agents who
want to obstruct your coronation."

Shlok 40: "Tell me now itself who your enemy be made deprived of life, honour and friendship,
by me. Command me so that how this earth will become your dominion. I am your servant.

Shlok 41: Then, Rama spoke thus to Lakshmana after consoling him time and again by weeping off
his tears; "Oh, Lakshmana! I stand by the words of our father. This indeed is a good path."



SARGA 24
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Kausalya requests Rama to take her to forest also. But Rama stops
Kausalya saying that service of husband is the ultimate dharma of wife and he obtains her
permission for him to go to forest.

Shlok 1: Seeing him firm minded in protecting the command of his father, Kausalya in a choked
voice spoke these righteous words:

Shlok 2: ï¿½Rama who is born in me and Dasaratha, is a righteous person. He speaks lovingly to
all beings. He has not faced grief at any time. How can such a person live in a forest, by
gathering grains ?'

Shlok 3: "While the dependants and the servants of Lord Rama eat pleasant foods all the
while, how can he eat roots and fruits himself in the forest ?"

Shlok 4: "Hearing that Rama the beloved and virtuous is being thus sent to exile by the king
, who will believe these words? Who will not develop fear ?"

Shlok 5: ï¿½Oh, Rama ! If you , the charming in the world are to go to exile , then it can be
certainly said that everything is ordered by a strong destiny'

Shlok 6-7-8: "Oh, Son! Soon after your departure to a distant forest, a great and incomparable
fire of sorrow will generate in my whole body. The wind which flares it up is your not being seen
here. My lamentation and grief are the fire-sticks. My wailing tears will be the offerings as an
oblation to fire. The choking and anxiety will be a great smoke .The thought that when you would
return, will generate smoke again. Such a fire of grief will make me emaciated completely and will
burn like dry wood by fire in winter.'

Shlok 9: "Oh, Son! A cow follows its calf wherever it goes. So also, I shall come with you
wherever you go."'

Shlok 10: "Oh, son! A cow follows its calf wherever it goes. So also, I shall come with you wherever you go."

Shlok 11: "Kaikeyi already deceived the king .He will not be alive, when I leave for the
forest and you also leave him .It is certain."

Shlok 12: "To a woman, abandonment of husband is entirely a cruel act. That bad act is not to
be perceived even by mind."

Shlok 13: "Till Dasaratha, my father and the great king is alive, you should serve him well.
It is eternal justice."

Shlok 14: After Rama spoke thus, Kausalya with auspicious appearance, was very much pleased
and spoke to Rama, who performs indefatigable actions, in consent.

Shlok 15: That Rama, the best among upholders of righteousness, after hearing the words of his
mother ,spoke again to her who was very much distressed.

Shlok 16: "The words of father are to be followed by you and me. For all, he is the king, the
nourished, a venerable man, the best among men, the lord and the ruler."

Shlok 17: "After roaming in the great forest for fourteen years, I shall come back and very
gladly stand by your command."

Shlok 18: After hearing the words of Rama, Kausalya who was affectionate to her son , was in
great sorrow with her face filled with tears and spoke thus to her beloved son Rama .

Shlok 19: "Oh, Rama! I can not reside in the middle of these step-wives. If you have made up
your mind to go to forest as per your father's wish ,also take me, like taking a female deer of the
forest ,to the woods ''

Shlok 20: "Rama spoke thus these words bemoaningly to her, who was weeping= "as long as a
woman is alive ,her husband is god and master to her".

Shlok 21: "King Dasaratha, supreme commander has authority over you and me also now. when
king, the lord of the earth and the wise man is there , we are not indeed master-less.'

Shlok 22: "Bharata also, who is a righteous person and who speaks lovingly to all beings will
be obliging to you. He is indeed always devoted to righteousness.'

Shlok 23: "While I take leave, take care of the king attentively so that he will not get
fatigued even a little with grief over his son."

Shlok 24: "Act always soothingly for a well-being of the aged king, seeing that his terrible
grief will not destroy him ."

Shlok 25: ï¿½Even if a woman is interested in religious vows and fastings in addition to being
the best of the excellent ;if she does not obey her husband she will become ill-fated !''

Shlok 26: ï¿½Even if a woman does not offer salutation to celestials and does not worship the
gods, she will attain the highest heaven by service to her husband ."

Shlok 27: ï¿½She has to do service, truly devoted in love and welfare of her husband. This is
seen in the world from the beginning, was heard from ancient texts and mentioned as
righteousness.'

Shlok 28: Oh, Mother! You always worship gods by sacrificial fire and by flowers for my sake .
Brahmanas also with right voes are to be worshipped .'

Shlok 29: "Look forward for the time of my return in such a manner with restraint, being
temperate in food and being devoted in the service of your husband."

Shlok 30: "After my return, your best desire will be fulfilled if our father the best among
protectors of righteousness ,is still alive till then."

Shlok 31: Kausalya who was afflicted with grief over her son, was with eyes full of tears
after hearing Rama's utterances and spoke thus to Rama.

Shlok 32: "Oh, Brave son! I am not able to avert your well-made resolution, in the matter of
your going to forest. Time is inscrutable .It is certain."

Shlok 33: "Oh, son! You go undisturbed. Let there be auspiciousness always to you .I shall
become refreshed, when you return again."

Shlok 34: "You, the illustrious after accomplishing a purpose, having observed a vow and
having attained freedom from debt to your father, after having come again, I shall get great
happiness".

Shlok 35: "The path of the destiny, which extinguishes my words and impels you to go to the
forest ,is ever not imaginable on this earth"

Shlok 36: "Oh, Rama the valiant !Go just now and come again safely, when you will rejoice me
with your pleasing and tranquillising words ."

Shlok 37: "How good it will be, if today itself is the day of your returning from the forest,
wearing twisted hair and garment made of bark."

Shlok 38: "The queen kausalya thus saw Rama who decided to go to forest .She spoke these words
with most excellent mind to Rama having auspicious qualities, being desirous of averting evil by
recitation of auspicious words."



SARGA 25
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Kausalya bids farewell to Rama preparing to go to forest. Rama
leaves her residence and goes to Seetha.

Shlok 1: Kausalya, the magnanimous mother putting away her grief, sipped water from the palm
of the hand, became purified and performed rites conducive to the welfare of Rama.

Shlok 2: "Oh, Rama! Your departure cannot be restrained, depart now, return soon. Abide in
the footsteps of the virtuous."

Shlok 3: "Oh, Rama! Let that righteousness, which you are fostering with courage and
discipline , protect you".

Shlok 4: "Oh, son! To whom you will be bowing in salutation at cross-roads and in temples,
those along with great saints will protect you in the forest.

Shlok 5: "All the arms given by the wise sage Viswamitra to you, will ever protect you who
are rich in good qualities"

Shlok 6: "Oh, son with magnificent arms! Protected by your service to father and service to
mother as well as truthfulness, you will belong-lived"

Shlok 7: "Oh, Rama, the best among men! May the wooden sticks used for feeding the sacred
fire, blades of the sacred Kusa grass and rings of Kusa grass(worn on the forth finger on
sacrificial occasions)sacrificial altars , temples and various sites selected by Brahmanas for
worship of gods, mountains, trees, bushes, large and deep pools of water, birds, snakes and lions
protect you."

Shlok 8-9: "May the saadhyas and viswadevas (two different kinds of gods) and wind-gods along
with eminent sages ensure your happiness. May the cosmic person and the creator bring happiness to
you. May the Pusha, Bhaga and Aryama (three of the twelve sons of Aditi)and the guardians of the
spheres with Indra as their Head do good to you."

Shlok 10: "May the six seasons, all the fortnights and months, years, nights, days and hours
always do good to you.

Shlok 11: "May Veda, the Smriti texts taken as one body, the resolution and the piety protect
you, my son! May lord Skanda (the younger son of Lord Siva)and the moon god along with the sage
Brihaspati(the preceptor of gods), the well known seven sages as well as Sage Narada guard you on
all sides."

Shlok 12: "May the four quarters along with the glorious guardians of the four quarters which
are enlogised by me may protect you always on all sides in that forest."

Shlok 13-14: " Let all mountains , oceans, king(of oceans) Varuna, heaven and earth, the
intermediate space between them , rivers , astrological mansions including gods presiding over
them, day and night, the morning and evening twilights may protect you while you reside in the
forest ."

Shlok 15: "The six holy seasons, months, years and the measures of time known as Kala
(equilent to one minute) and Kastha(1/30th of Kala or two seconds)bestow you happiness"

Shlok 16: "Let the heavenly deities and the demons too ever grant happiness on you while you
traverse through the large forest, in the guise of a hermit and full of wisdom "

Shlok 17: "Oh, son! Let there not be fear for you of demons the terrible ones performing cruel
deeds, of devilish beings called Pisachas and of all carnivorous animals."

Shlok 18: "In that impenetrable forest occupied by you, let there be no monkeys, scorpions,
gad fies, mosquitoes, snakes or other insects ."

Shlok 19: "Oh, son! Let the great elephants , lions with tusks, tigers, bears, terrible
he-buffaloes with horns not to be hostile to you.

Shlok 20: "Oh, son! Let the other ferocious man-eaters belonging to animal-species, being
worshipped by me here, not hurt you."

Shlok 21: "Oh, Rama, my son! May your path-ways be propitious ! Let your valour be powerful!
Go well with all accomplishments!.

Shlok 22: "Let there be security to you against those dwelling in the atmosphere and on the
earth as well as against all the celestials as also your enemies."

Shlok 23: "Oh, Rama! May Venus and the moon as also the sun and Kubera (the god of wealth) and
Yama (the god of death) who are being worshipped by me, protect you, while you reside in the forest
of Dandaka"

Shlok 24: "Oh, Rama! May sacred hymns coming forth from fire, air , vapour, and from the mouth
of singer of sacred hymns protect you at the time of taking bath."

Shlok 25: "Let Siva, the lord of all spheres, Brahma, the lord of creation, Vishnu, the
nourisher of beings, the sages and the rest of the celestials may protect you dwelling in the
forest.

Shlok 26: Uttering thus, the illustrious Kausalya having large eyes, worshipped troops of
divinities with garlands , sandal paste and befitting hymns of praise.

Shlok 27: Duly procuring fire, she caused oblation to be poured into it, as per the direction
of a high souled brahmana for the purpose of Rama's well- being .

Shlok 28: Kausalya, the excellent woman procured clarified butter , white garlands, ceremonial
sticks and white mustard seeds.

Shlok 29: That preceptor performed ceremony for peace as per the statute as well as without
error and carried out propitiatory oblation externally with the remaining sacrificial food left
after the main offering .

Shlok 30: She then got brahmanas to pronounce blessings with honey, curd , unbroken grains of
rice and clarified butter by the repetition of certain hymns and to utter prayers for the well -
being of Rama in the forest.

Shlok 31: The illustrious Kausalya gave the desired fee to that chief of brahmanas and spoke
as follows to Rama:-

Shlok 32: "Which felicity occurred in Devendra the thousand- eyed, adored by all celestials
when a demon called Vritta was destroyed, let that felicity occur to you"

Shlok 33: "Which blessing was invoked by Vinata to Garuda who was setting off to bring nectar
in the past , may that blessing happen to you."

Shlok 34: "While blessing was bestowed on Devendra, the wielder of the thunderbolt , killing
the demons at the time of producing nectar, let that blessing come to you "

Shlok 35: "Oh, Rama! Which good fortune occurred to Vishnu who was immensely glorious while
making his three strides (in order to measure the three worlds), let that good fortune come to
you

Shlok 36: "Oh, Rama, the mighty armed! May the seasons , oceans , Dvipas (principal division
of earth girdled by oceans ), vedas, various spheres and quarters confer blessings with good luck
to you."

Shlok 37-38: saying so, Kausalya, the large eyed proud woman placed some unbroken rice grains on
her son's head, smeared varieties of sandal pastes over his body, fastened about his wrist by way
of an amulet, a herb called Visalyakarani(so called because it helps in painlessly extracting an
arrow stuck into one's body )which is efficacious and auspicious and muttered sacred hymns in order
to enhance its virtue.

Shlok 39: Though filled with grief inside, she appeared to be over-joyed outside and with
faltering words , spoke thus with only mouth and not with her heart.

Shlok 40: The illusrious Kausalya embraced Rama, smelling his head by bending it and spoke
these words "Rama, my son! Go with ease with accomplishment of purpose, as you are."

Shlok 41: Oh, son! With all your purposes fulfilled and with good health, I shall see you
returning to Ayodhya happily and taking over the reins of the kingdom

Shlok 42: "All my thoughts of grief having been expulsed and my face shining with joy, I shall
behold you returning from the forest like the full moon rising from the horizon"

Shlok 43: "Oh, Rama! I shall behold you returning here from your sojourn in the forest, having
fulfilled your father's word and installed on the splendid throne."

Shlok 44: "Having come here from your sojourn in the forest, you will be familiar with
auspicious things and will ever be augmenting the desires of my daughter-in-law and of me. Depart
now, Oh, Rama !"

Shlok 45: "Oh, Rama! Worshipped by me, let the hosts of gods headed by Siva, the Supreme
Being, the great sages, spirits, the chief of evil spirits, the celestial serpents and the
(four)quarters wish well of you, who is setting forth to forest, "

Shlok 46: Having so said and having completed the rite of invoking blessings befittingly,
Kausalya whose eyes were overflowing with tears, further went clockwise around Rama and having
pressed close to him, embraced again and again.

Shlok 47: Having been done circumbulation (as a mark of protection) thus by the pious woman
Kausalya, that highly illustrious Rama pressing his mother's feet again and again , shining by his
own splendour, went to Sita's house



SARGA 26
------------------------------

[Text] Seeing Rama being sad seetha wants to know the reason Rama then lets her know his
father's wish and his decision to go to forest. He then askes her to stay in Ayodhya.

Shlok 1-2: The prince Rama, having been invoked blessings by his mother, after having
salutation to Kausalya and remaining firmly in his virtuous path, set out journey to the forest.
Entering to the road filled with people, he made it shine with his splendour and stirred the hearts
of the people because of his excellent qualities.

Shlok 3: Sita, practising for the coronation ceremony, did not hear anything on that matter.
She was thinking of installation of Rama alone as prince Regent in her heart

Shlok 4: As she knows what is to be done and is aware of rules relating to kings Sita herself
being rejoiced in heart, performed the worship of the gods and was waiting for the prince.

Shlok 5: Thereafter Rama, slightly turning his face down , entered his own house which is
well decorated and is filled with rejoicing people all around

Shlok 6: Sita sprang up from her seat and trembled by seeing her husband stricken with
sorrow, his mind perturbed with anxiety.

Shlok 7: By seeing her, Rama the virtuous man could not contain that grief existing in his
mind and hence got unveiled.

Shlok 8: Seeing him pale-faced, perspired and without endurance, Sita (stricken with grief)
spoke thus what is this now , my Lord!

Shlok 9: Oh , Rama! It is indeed told by learned brahmanas that today's constellation Pushya
(which is presided by sage bR^ihaspati) which is propitions, is suitable (for coronation). Why are
you sadly disposed?

Shlok 10: Your handsome face does not shine splendidly as it should when covered by an
umbrella white as water-froth and provided with a hundred ribs.

Shlok 11: Nor your lotus -eyed face is not being fanned (as it should ) by superior chowries
shining like a moon and a swan

Shlok 12: Nor the overjoyed and eloquent bards Sutas and Maagadhas (who sing portions of epic
poems and ancient ballads ) are seen here , praising you with auspicious words .

Shlok 13: Nor brahmanas who are well-versed in Vedas, have not placed , as per prescribed
Rites , honey and curds on your head after you had taken the head -bath

Shlok 14: All ministers, chiefs of Associations, citizens and country-folk, duly decked with
ornaments, are not inclined to go along with you.

Shlok 15: Why the main carriage used for travelling and pleasure, tied with four horses decked
with gold ornaments and with excellent speed does not go ahead of you ?

Shlok 16: Oh, valiant prince! A glorious elephant which is worshipped for its good
characteristics, resembling a mountain crowned with a dark cloud is not seen ahead in your
journey.

Shlok 17: Oh, brave man pleasant with the sight! I do not see marching before you an elephant
having been placed in front with an excellent seat embroidered in gold meant for you

Shlok 18: While coronation is getting ready now, the colour of your face is appearing strange.
Even happiness is not being seen (in you). Why is it?

Shlok 19: Rama spoke thus to Sita, who is lamenting : Oh, Sita! My venerable father is sending
me to a forest in exile.

Shlok 20: Oh, Sita ! You are born in a great family. You know what is Right and practise
virtue . hear me in what sequence it happened to me

Shlok 21: Two great boons were given to my mother Kaikeyi long ago , by my father Dasaratha
who is true to a promise.

Shlok 22: Now that the arrangements initiated by the king for my coronation are getting ready
, Kaikeyi came out with that promise of boons, turning the situation to her own advantage by
grounds of morality

Shlok 23: I have to dwell in Dandaka forest for fourteen years .Bharata is being appointed as
prince by my father

Shlok 24-25: Before setting forth to the lonely forest, I came to see you. I should not be
praised at any time in the presence of Bharata . Men endowed with power and fortune indeed do not
tolerate praise of others . Therefore, my virtues should not be extolled by you in front of
Bharata.

Shlok 26: You need not be attended in a special manner at any time by him. You can stay
familiar to him, by behaving with him conformably.

Shlok 27: The princely kingdom is given to him by the king permanently. Oh, Sita ! He is fit
to be rendered gracious by you, more so the king Dasaratha

Shlok 28: Keeping up the pledge of my father, today itself. Oh, Sita of magnanimous mind!
Remain firm.

Shlok 29: Oh, Sita the good and faultless lady ! After I leave for the forest frequented by
the sages, you can become interested in religious vows and fastings.

Shlok 30: You can rise up in dawn , perform worship of the deities as per precept and do
salutation to my father , king Dasaratha.

Shlok 31: Keeping in front of righteousness alone, you have to respect the aged Kausalya, my
mother who is getting emaciated by grief.

Shlok 32: For me all my mothers are equal in my eyes in point if fondness, love and the way in
which they have looked after me ( in my childhood). Hence the rest of mothers also deserve to be
saluted always by you

Shlok 33: You, in particular, should regard Bharata and Satrughna, as your brothers or
sons.

Shlok 34: Bharata is indeed king and the master both for the kingdom and for our family .
Hence, you should not do what is displeasing to him at any time.

Shlok 35: Kings being pleased by good character and served by exerting one's self become
happy. They get angry if it is to the contrary

Shlok 36: Kings abandon even their own sons, if they are antagonistic and accept even other
people if they are fitting

Shlok 37: Oh good lady ! You such dwell here, doing conformably to the will of Bharata the
king, remaining devoted to righteousness and with a vow of truth as you end.

Shlok 38: Oh, my dear Sita ! I can go to the great forest. You can stay here only, without
doing harm to any one as it is .Listen to my words

[Text] In this chapter Seetha asks Rama to take her to the forest.

Shlok 1: Sita, who speaks kindly and deserves kind utterances, after hearing Rama's words,
became angry out of love alone and spoke thus to her husband.

Shlok 2: Oh, Rama the prince! What words these are you speaking? These light words certainly
are to be laughed at by you and to me after hearning.

Shlok 3: "Oh, noble prince! Father, mother, brother, son and daughter-in-law accomplish their
own good fortune, as benefitted by their own pious deeds."

Shlok 4: "Oh, Rama the best of men! Wife for one gets fortune of the husband. For that
reason, I am also destined to dwell in the forest."

Shlok 5: " To a woman, father or son or self or mother or female companion are not the
recourse. Husband alone is forever the best recourse either in this world or after her death".

Shlok 6: "Oh, Rama! If you set forth now itself to the forest, which is difficult to be
travelled, I shall come before you, by trampling down thorns and grass with long pointed
stalks."

Shlok 7: "Oh, brave man! By abandoning, as water left over after drinking, the impatience and
anger and having faith, take me. There is no sin in me."

Shlok 8: "Protection under the feet of the husband is better than being on top of a lofty
building or in aerial cars or in moving through the sky or in attaining all types of
positions."

Shlok 9: "My mother and father taught me of different matters long ago. I need not be told
now, how to deal in any way with anyone."

Shlok 10: " I can come to forest which is inaccessible, which is devoid of people, filled with
various types of animals and inhaited by tigers and jackals."

Shlok 11: "Not thinking of three world, thinking of loyalty to husband, I shall dwell in the
forest happily as though staying in our father's house".

Shlok 12: "Oh, brave man! performing service to you regularly, having the necessary
discipline, observing chastity, I would like to stay with you in the forests which smell like
honey."

Shlok 13: "Oh, Rama, the bestower of honour! Here in the forest, you are indeed capable of
protecting other people also. Why to tell about my protection?"

Shlok 14: "Today no doubt, I will come to forest along with you. Oh, the illustrious! I, with
this intention, cannot be prevented to do so."

Shlok 15: I shall live only on roots and fruits always, no doubt. Living along with you, I
shall not create any unpleasantness to you.

Shlok 16: " With you the learned and the lord, I shall not have fear anywhere. I wish to see
rivers, mountains, small lakes and grooves."

Shlok 17: I shall be comfortable, by coming together with you, the courageous man. I desire to
see lotus- ponds filled with swans, water-fowls and excellently flowered.

Shlok 18: "Oh, the large eyed lord! Remaining dedicated to you, I shall take bath regularly in
those lakes and with full of joy, I shall sport with you."

Shlok 19: Thus spending even a hundred thousand years in your company I shall never find any
deviation/ Heaven also will not be acceptable to me otherwise.

Shlok 20: Oh, Lion among men and seion of Raghu! Even if in heaven there is residence for me
without you, I do not like it.

Shlok 21: I shall proceed to the forest, which is very much inaccessible and occupied by
monkeys, elephants as well as other animals. Clining to your feet alone, I shall dwell in the
forest as though in father's home.

Shlok 22: "Therefore, grant well my prayer and usher me- me without any other thought, whose
mind is fondly attached to you and who am determined to die if separated from you. Due to this,
there will be no burden to you from me."

Shlok 23: sita along with him eventhought she was speaking as a foresaid. To hold her back
from coming to forest, he also started talking highly of the various afflictions she might have to
face in a forest.

[Text] In this chapter Rama describes various troubles of staying in forest and beseeches
seetha not to go to forest

Shlok 1: Thinking of difficulties one will be called upon to bear in the forest, Rama who was
fond of righteousness did not form the idea of taking Sita who was speaking as aforesaid.

Shlok 2: Soothening with kind words to Sita, when eyes were blemished with tears, the
virtuous Rama spoke again as follows, for the purpose of waking her turn back.

Shlok 3: "Sita! Your are born in a high lineage, ever devoted to righteousness. Perform your
own virtue here, which is agreable to my mind."

Shlok 4: "Oh Sita, the delicate! Do whatever I tell you. There are many inconveniencs in the
forest. Know them from me."

Shlok 5: "Oh, Sita! Let your thought made about forest be given up. It is indeed said that
forest with its wilderness is fraught with many dangers."

Shlok 6: This advice is given by me, keeping your welfare in view. I do not ever consider a
forest as comfortable. It is always uncomfortable."

Shlok 7: "The sounds created from waterfalls in hills and from lions resding in mountain
caves are unpleasant to hear. That is why living in a forest in uncomfortable."

Shlok 8: "Large wild animals which are fearless and intoxicated sporting in the desolate
forest; come forward, after seeing. Oh, Sita! That is why living in forest is uncomfortable."

Shlok 9: "Even streams filled with crocodiles full of mire are difficult to be crossed by rut
elephants also. Hence dwelling in a forest is always very much uncomfortable.

Shlok 10: "Pathways covered with creepers and thorns, echoed with noise of wild cocks, are
water-less and very difficult to enter. Hence dwelling in a forest is hardship."

Shlok 11: "One distress by fatigue has to sleep in nights on a bed of fallen leaves. Hence,
living in a forest is very much a misery."

Shlok 12: "Oh, Sita! With mind disciplined day and night, one has to necessarily satisfy
ourself with fruits fallen from trees. Hence, living in a forest is a suffering."

Shlok 13: "Oh, Sita the princess of Mithila! Fasting is to be done according to one's stamina.
Clothes of bark are to be worn and mass of matted hair has to be worn on the head."

Shlok 14: "The celestials, the ancestors, the guests who arrive are to be worshipped always
according to the preseribed rites."

Shlok 15: "Bath is to be performed three times a day at appropriate time by the one moving in
the forest, with one's mind kept in restraint. Hence, living in a forest is very much a
misery."

Shlok 16: "Oh, Sita the innocent! Offering is to be done with flowers brought by one's own
self at the altar, according to the rites prescribed by sages. Hence, living in a forest is a
hardship."

Shlok 17: "Oh, Sita the princess of Mithila! The dwellers of forest are to be satisfied with
whatever is obtained there, the restricted food. Hence, living in forest is a misery.

Shlok 18: "In the forest, air and darkness are too much. There are always hunger and great
fears too. Hence, dwelling in a forest is very much a misery."

Shlok 19: "Oh, Sita! Various creeping animals of different forms roam about on earth with
pride. Hence dwelling in a forst is a great misery."

Shlok 20: "Snakes dwelling in rivers, moving crookedly like rivers, stay obstucting the
pathways. Hence, living in forest is a great misery."

Shlok 21: "Oh, frail princess! Flying insects, scropious, insects including mosquitoes and
files always annoy every one. Hence, forest is full of hardship."

Shlok 22: "Oh, Sita! Forest is full of trees, kusa grass and bambooes with ends of their
branches spread on all sides. Hence, living in a forest is a great misery."

Shlok 23: "An inhabitant living in a forest has to face various bodily troubles and panics.
Hence, forest- life is readly a misery."

Shlok 24: "Anger and greed are to be abandoned by the dwellers of forest. Devotion is to be
bestowed on asceticism. What needs to be feared, should not be feared. Hence, living in a forest is
a suffereing."

Shlok 25: "Therefore, do away with the idea of your coming to the forest. Forest is not indeed
bearable for you. Reflecting now, I perceive forest as having too many disadvantages."

Shlok 26: As the great souled Rama did not agree to take her to the forest, the much aggrieved
Sita spoke to Rama as follows:-



SARGA 29
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha implores upon Rama to allow her to come to forests, and says that she heard
through some foretellers that she has to live in forests for some time, when she was with her
father's place. But Rama is not interested to make Seetha's life penurious in forests and once
again tries to pacify her. He asks her to stay back at Ayodhya. For that Seetha laments to become
lonely parted with her husband.

Shlok 1: Seetha was distressed to hear these words of Rama and spoke these words slowly, with
her face with tears.

Shlok 2: "know all those disadvantages you mentioned about dwelling in the forest become
advantages to me, if your affection is placed before them."

Shlok 3-4: "Oh Rama! Antelopes, lions, elephants, tigers, sarabhas(legendary animal with eight
legs), birds, yaks and all others which roam in the forest, run away after seeing your form, since
they have never seen your figure before. When there is cause for fear, who would not have
fear?"

Shlok 5: "Oh, Rama! As per the command of the elders, I also should go along with you. My
life is to be abandoned here, if I were separated from you."

Shlok 6: "Oh Rama! Even Devendra the Lord of celestials, by his strength, cannot over power
me, who is in your vicinity."

Shlok 7: "Oh Rama! Verily such a thing was taught to me by you, that a woman disunited from
her husband should not be able to survive."

Shlok 8: "Oh Rama, the very wise! Besides, formerly in my father's house it was heard by me
from the month of brahmanas that I was destined to stay really in a forest."

Shlok 9: "Oh Rama the man of great strength! Ever since I heard this word from brahmanas who
can interpret marks on the body, I was always eager to stay in a forest."

Shlok 10: "Oh, Rama the beloved! That prediction of dwelling in the forst is to be realised by
me. I must accordingly accompany you to the forest, it cannot be otherwise."

Shlok 11: "I shall be the one who has fulfilled the brahmana's word. I shall accompany you to
the forest. The time has come for brahmana's words to come true."

Shlok 12: "Oh valiant prince! I know that in the forest, sufferings indeed are many and are
invariably obtained by men having unformed minds."

Shlok 13: "While I was an unmarried girl, the prediction about my dwelling the forest was
heard by me in my father's house from a female mendicant having good manners, in the presence of my
mother."

Shlok 14: "Oh Lord! In the past, you have been really pleased for many a time to take me along
with you indeed for the tour of a forest, as longed by me."

Shlok 15: "Oh, Rama! May all be well with you! I am waiting for a journey to the forest. A
work-out of adventurist is really delightful to me."

Shlok 16: "Oh, the pure-minded! Following my husband with loving devotion, I shall become
sin-less; for husband is the supreme deity to me."

Shlok 17-18: "Even after my death, I shall stay united with you. On this subject, the meritorious
words of brahmanas is being heard thus:- In this world, which woman was given away to whom by
parents with water according to the moral code binding on them, that woman belongs to him alone
even after death.

Shlok 19: "By what reason now are you thus not willing to take me, the woman having good
conduct, devoted to her husband and belonging to you, from this place?"

Shlok 20: "Oh Rama, the seion of Kakutsa! You ought to take me, who is a devotee, so devoted
to husband, who is distressed who feels alike in pleasure and pain and shares your joys and
sorrows."

Shlok 21: "I shall take resort to poison or fire or water for dying, if you are not willing to
take me, afflicted as I am, as above."

Shlok 22: Eventhough she requested him in many ways about setting out to the forest, he did
not agree to take her to the forest, which is a solitary place.

Shlok 23: After hearing Rama's words, seetha was sorrowful, moistening with earth as it were
with burning tears, trickling down her eyes.

Shlok 24: Rama the prudent man then pacified in many ways, to avert that Seetha with red lips,
who was sorrowful as above.



SARGA 30
------------------------------

[Text] The persistence of Seetha continues to go along with Rama to forest. But Rama tried
to pacify her telling that rendering service to elders staying back at home is advisable for ladies
like Seetha, but in vain. Finally Rama had to yield to her prevail and accepts her to come along
and asks her to give away her personal belongings to Brahmins in charity before they proceed.

Shlok 1: Seetha daughter of Janaka being pacified by Rama in the matter of living in the
forest, spoke the following words to her husband.

Shlok 2: Distressed and highly agitated, the said Seetha reproached Rama having a broad
chest, from affection and pride in the following words:-

Shlok 3: "What my father, the king of Mithila belonging to the country of Videha, think of
himself having got as so-in-law you, a woman having the form of a man?"

Shlok 4: "It is a pity if these people of Ayodhya through ignorance tell the falsehood that
excellent valour is lacking in Rama as in a blazing sun."

Shlok 5: "For what reason are you cast down or whence fear in you, for which you are willing
to desert me, for whom there is no other recourse."

Shlok 6: "Oh, Brave man! Know me to be as dependent on your will as Savitri who was devoted
to Satyavan the son of Dyumatsena."

Shlok 7: "Rama, the faultless man! I will not see, even in thought, anyone except you as any
other woman bringing disrepute to her family would! I shall accompany you to the forest."

Shlok 8: " Oh, Rama! I am a young girl, lived for a long time with you, a chaste woman and
your wife. How would you like an actor intend to deliver me to oehrs by your own will?"

Shlok 9: "Oh, Rama the sinless one! Be you always dutiful and obedient to him, whom you speak
of welfare, for whose sake I am being kept back.(But it is improper to ask me to stay obedient to
him)."

Shlok 10: "It is not proper for you as such to set out to the forest without taking me. Any
term of austerities or forest or even heaven, let it be to me with you only."

Shlok 11: "To me, who follow you behind, there will be no tiresomeness. I shall remain in the
path without any fatigue, as remaining in a place of recreation or as in a sleep.

Shlok 12: "While walking with you, blades of kusha grass, shrubs by the name of kaasa, reeds
and rushes and plants with prickles which fall in the path will touch my soles like a heap of
cotton or soft deerskin."

Shlok 13: "Oh, beloved! I shall reckon the dust raised by the strongest wind that will cover
my body as sandal dust of highest advantage."

Shlok 14: "While dwelling in the forest, in its midst, I shall lie down on green grass. Will
lying in beds with carpets be more comfortable than that?"

Shlok 15: "Leaves, tubers and fruits either a little or abundant in quantity brought and given
by you yourself will be like nectar to me."

Shlok 16: "Enjoying the flowers and fruits belonging to various seasons there, I shall neither
recollect my mother nor father nor my home."

Shlok 17: "Hence, you are not justified to see anything unpleasant there. There will be no
annoyance to you because of me. I will not be difficult to be maintained."

Shlok 18: "Your companionship will be a heaven to me. Without you, it will be a hell. Oh,
Rama! By knowing thus my great love, obtain supreme joy with me."

Shlok 19: "On the contrary, if you do not take me, who is not alarmed of the forest as such, I
shall drink poison now itself. But on no account would I bow to the enemies."

Shlok 20: "Oh, Lord! As a result of grief I will not going to live even afterwards when
abandoned by you. Death is therefore better at the time of your relinquishment itself."

Shlok 21: "I cannot bear this grief even for a moment, why again fourteen years in
misery."

Shlok 22: Seetha, burnt by grief, having got exerted, lamented much piteously, embraced her
husband and cried a lot with loud voice.

Shlok 23: persecuted with many homilies like a female elephant pierced with poisoned arrows,
she shed tears that had long been held back even as a piece of wood would emit fire(throught
attrition with another)

Shlok 24: Crystal-like tears woozed from her eyes because of grief, like water-drops from two
lotus flowers.

Shlok 25: Her face with shining brilliance of the moon and having longish eyes, withered with
tears as a lotus flower pulled out from water.

Shlok 26: Then Rama embraced her, with arms, who was depressed and had fainted as it were,
spoke the following words, fully reassuring her.

Shlok 27: "Oh, queen! I do not relish even heaven while you are in grief. There is indeed no
fear whatsoever to me, like the god of Brahma.'

Shlok 28: "Oh, Seetha with the auspicious face! Eventhough I am able to protect you, without
knowing your entire opinion, I do not like to take you to the forest."

Shlok 29: "Oh, Seetha! it appears that you are created indeed for dwelling in the forest with
me. Hence, you cannot be left behind by me, like the honour by a man of self-regard."

Shlok 30: "Oh Seetha, with thighs like the posteriors of an elephant! Earlier, righeousness
(like fulfilling the father's command) was practised by good men. Now, I shall follow that
righteousness, like Suvarchala(wife of the sun) following the sun."

Shlok 31: "Oh, Seetha! I cannot desist from not going to forest. That word, of my father, made
strong by his truthfulnes is taking me to the forest."

Shlok 32: "Oh, comely lady! Being obedient to father and mother is one's sacred duty. That is
why, I do not wish to survive, in violation of that duty."

Shlok 33: "Mother, father and teacher are at our own disposal. By negelecting them as such,
how can we worship god, who is not at our disposal, by various modes?"

Shlok 34: "Oh, lady with enchanting glances! The triad of mother, father and teacher is the
world-triad. There is none other in the world equal to it. Hence, this triad is worthy of
worship."

Shlok 35: "Oh, Seetha! In which manner service to father is regarded as strengthening, in the
same manner truth or sacrificial rites where presents are received by officiating priest are not
strengthening."

Shlok 36: "By compliance with the wishes of one's elders, heavenly bliss or riches, foodgrains
or leaving, sons or amenities of life - nothing whatsoever is hard to obtain."

Shlok 37: "High souled men, wholly devoted to their parents obtain the regions of gods and the
gandharvas, the seventh heaven presided the gandharvas, the seventh heaven presided by Brahma (the
creator) and Goloka (the highest heaven abiding in cows and presided over by Sri Radha and Sri
Krishna the first couple).

Shlok 38: "I desire to obey in the same manner as to how my father, abiding in truthfulness
and virtue, commands me. That itself is indeed the law of morality, which is eternal."

Shlok 39: "Oh, Seetha! My mind was depressed to take you to the forest of Dandaka. But you are
saying that you will reside in the forst, duly determined to follow me."

Shlok 40: "Oh, mistress with fascinating eyes and flawless limbs! Since you were allowed to
come to forest, Oh Seetha the timid lady, follow me and become my help-mate."

Shlok 41: "Oh, Seetha the beautiful! You adopted very auspicious resolve, suitable in all ways
to me and to your race."

Shlok 42: "Oh, lady with charming hip and loins! Now itself, begin with duties appropriate for
living in exile. Oh, Seetha! Even a heaven is not a liking to me without your presence."

Shlok 43: "Give valuable gifts to Brahmanas and food to mendicants. Be very quick. Do not
delay."

Shlok 44-45: "Give to the various classes of your dependents whatever costly ornaments, beautiful
and fine articles of wearing apparel, gadgets used for sports, my couches, conveyances and other
articles left after satisfying brahmanas."

Shlok 46: Seetha the divine lady, elated to know her departure acceptable to her husband,
quickly set about, making gifts.

Shlok 47: Thereafter, the illustrious and pure-minded lady, becoming delighted on hearing the
speech of her husband, started giving riches and valuable gifts to virtuous souls.



SARGA 31
------------------------------

[Text] Overhearing the conversation of Rama and Seetha, Lakshmana who came there earlier
enters into dialogue with his brother, insisting that he too shall accompany Rama and Seetha to
forests. Rama tries to persuade him to stay back, in vain. Then Rama had to agree to Lakshmana's
insistence and asks him to fetch the divine bows, arrows and swords given by gods in the
Vedic-ritual of Seetha's father, namely King Janaka.

Shlok 1-2: Lakshmana who came there earlier, heard the conversation of Seetha and Rama, having
his eyes glut with tears, being unable to bear the anguish, tightly pressed the feet of his bother
and spoke (as floows) to Rama who was performing a great vow and to Seetha who enjoyed great
honour.

Shlok 3: "If you decided to go to the forest filled with antelopes and elephants, I, in front
wearingthe bow, shall accompany you to the forest."

Shlok 4: "Together with me, you will travel in the various forests, resonant with sounds of
birds and herds of wild animals."

Shlok 5: "Without you, I do not want ascendency to heaven now do I desire immortality now do
I wish for sovereignity over the globes."

Shlok 6: Lakshmana who was speaking in favour of coming to the forst, was forbidden by Rama
through many of his pacifying words. After hearing them, Lakshmana again soke as follows:

Shlok 7: "I was indeed permitted by you earlier. How is it that you are prohibiting me
now?"

Shlok 8: "Oh, the faultless man! I desire to know the reason for prohibiting me, who is
indeed willing to come to the forest, because there is doubt in my mind."

Shlok 9: Thereafter Rama of great splendour spoke to Lakshmana the valiant man who was
standing in front, intending to preceede Sri Rama and soliciting with joined palms.

Shlok 10: "You are so friendly, interested in righteousness, valiant, abiding always in a good
path, dear to me as life, obedient, my brother and a companion."

Shlok 11: "Oh Lakshmana! If you proceed to the forest along with me now, who will support
Kausalya or the illustrious Sumitra?"

Shlok 12: "That emperor of great splendour, who used to shower blessings on the people as a
cloud sends down rain on the earth, stands circumscribed by cord of love."

Shlok 13: "That Kaikeyi daughter of king Aswapathi, after obtaining this kingdom, will
certainly not accord good treatment to her step-wives, who are at grief."

Shlok 14: "Bharata on acquiring the kingdom will be devoted to Kaikeyi and will not think of
sorrowful Kausalya or Sumitra."

Shlok 15: "Oh, Lakshmana! You stay here and support the venerable Kausalya through your own
self or by obtaining favour through the king. Do this thing, as said."

Shlok 16: "Oh, Lakshmana the knower of righteousness! Thus, your devotion towards me will have
been fully demonstrated by you. By honouring the elders, a great unqualled religious merit will
accrue to you."

Shlok 17: "Oh, Lakshmana, the exhilarator of Raghu dynasty! Do this for my sake. There will be
no happiness to our mother, if she is left behind by us."

Shlok 18: Lakshmana who is intelligent in speech, after hearing Rama's words, replied in a
gentle voice to him who is skilled in speech.

Shlok 19: "Oh, Rama the valiant! Bharata being inspired by your splendour of morality will
respect Kausalya and Sumitra. There is no doubt in this matter."

Shlok 20: "Kausalya obtained (by grant) thousand villages , which are dependent on her. Hence,
that venerable Kausalya can maintain even thousand people like me."

Shlok 21: "The illustrious Kausalya is competent not only to maintain herself but also my
mother and people like me in addition."

Shlok 22: "Make me your attendant. In this, there is no unrighteousness. Besides, I will be
accomplishing my object. Your purpose also will be fulfilled."

Shlok 23: "Taking my bow and arrows and carrying a spade and a basket, I will walk in front of
you showing the path."

Shlok 24: "I will procure for you for all time the tubers, fruits and other things which are
good food stuffs available in the forest for sages."

Shlok 25: "You along with Seetha enjoy yourself on mountain-ridges. I shall do everything
while you are waking or sleeping."

Shlok 26: Rama, very much delighted of hearing these words, said to him: "Oh, Lakshmana! Go,
take leave of all your friends."

Shlok 27-28-29: "Oh, Lakshma! At a grand sacrifice perfomed by Janaka, the great-souled Varuna(god
of water) personally gave heavently bows which are dreadful to look at, divine impenetrable pices
of armour, quivers containing an inexhanstible stock of arms, two swords decked with gold and with
spotless lustre like that of a sun - all these were kept at the residence of our receptor Vasista,
after paying due reverence. Take all those arms and return soon."

Shlok 30: Lakshmana, who was assured of his sojourn in the forest, after bidding good bye ot
his friends, approached Vasista the preceptor of Ikshvaku dynasty and took the excellent
armoury.

Shlok 31: Lakshmana, a tiger among princes, showed to Rama all those arms, which were divine,
being worshipped and decorated by garlands.

Shlok 32: Rama, who had fully controlled his mind, affectionately spoke as follows to
Lakshmana who arrived: "Oh, Lakshmana, the excellent man! You came in time as desired by me."

Shlok 33: "Lakshmana, the chastiser of foes! along with you, I want to give all this wealth
pertaining to me to brahmanas, practising ansterities."

Shlok 34: "I also desire to give to those excellent brahmanas residing here as strong devotees
to their proceptors and to all my dependents."

Shlok 35: "You bring boon the venerable Suyagna, the son of Vasista, the best. After adoring
all other brahmanas also who are cultured, I will go to the forest."



Thus completes 31st chapter in the Ayodhya kanda of the glorious Ramayayana of
Valmiki, the work of a sage and the oldest epic.

SARGA 32
------------------------------

[Text] Rama bestows parting gifts to Vedic scholars and their wives. Thereafter he also
accords charities to Brahmins, young scholars, servants, and others. Rama accords an unusual gift,
of cows filling a space of miles and miles, to a poor Brahmin named Trijata. Then Rama is blessed
for a bon voyage by all of the eminent Vedic scholars.

Shlok 1: Thereupon, Lakshmana obeying his brother's order which is kindly and auspicious,
went immediately to the house of suyajna.

Shlok 2: Offering salutation to that brahmana living in a house of fire, Lakshmana spoke as
follows: "Oh, friend! Come and see the house of Rama who is doing an arduous task."

Shlok 3: Then, Suyajna, having performed worship at the juncture of day and night, came at
once along with Lakshmana and entered Rama's house which was good-looking and inhabited by Lakshmi
the goddess of wealth.

Shlok 4: Seeing him arrived, Rama with joined palms along with Seetha, moved clockwise as
around sacrificial fire, that Suyajna the venerable man who had the knowledge of Vedas.

Shlok 5- 6: Rama adored Suyajna with excellent Angadas(armlets) and beautiful earrings of gold,
gems stung on gold threads as also with keyuras( another ornament similar in shape to an Angada but
worn above it near the armpit) and bracelets as well as with many other excellent precious stones.
urged by Seetha, the said Rama then spoke to suyajna as follows:

Shlok 7: "Oh the gentle sage, my friend! Now, Seetha wants to give for your wife a pearl
necklace, a string of gold and a girdle. please take them."

Shlok 8: "Oh, friend! Seetha who is departing to the forest, is giving you for your wife
armlets adorned with figures cut in them and beautiful keyuras."

Shlok 9: "Seetha wants to offer you that couch also inlaid with various jewels and provided
with an excellent coverlet."

Shlok 10: "Oh, the best of brahmanas! I am giving you this elephant called Satrunjaya, given
earlier to me by my maternal uncle as well as those thousand elephants."

Shlok 11: As requested by Rama, suyajna accepted the gift and bestowed bening blessings to
Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha.

Shlok 12: Then, Rama who speaks polite words as coolly as Brahma to Devendra, spoke to his
beloved brother Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 13: "Oh, Lakshmana! Call those two excellent brahmanas Agastya and Kausika and worship
them with valuable gifts as water is poured to a crop of corn."

Shlok 14: "Oh, Lakshmana the honour-giver, with great arms! Satiate them with thousands of
cows, gold, silver and with gems of great value."

Shlok 15-16: "Oh, Lakshmana! Which brahman is studying Taittiriya(a school of yajurveda), a
preceptor, a man of conformity; a knower of Vedas, serving Kausalya with his devotion and blessing,
to him see that he is duly gifted conveyance, servant maids and silken clothing till he gets
satisfied."

[Commentary] comment: Taittiriya was first taught by sage Vaisampayana to 27 pupils, among
whom was Yagnavalkya, Subsequently Vaisampayana being offended with Yaganavalkya, made him disgorge
the Veda committed to him which he did in a tangible form; whereupon the older disciples of
Vaisampayana being commanded to pick it up, took in the form of patridges, and swallowed the soiled
texts, hence named black(called Krishna Yajurveda) the other name of Taittiriya referring to the
partridges Yagnavalkya then received from the Sun a new or white version of the yajurveda (called
Shukla Yajurveda)

Shlok 17: "The charioteer called Chitraratha the companion of our venerable father was of very
long standing. Gratify him with valuable gifts of great worth, with clothes, with money, with all
types of small animals and with thousands of cows."

Shlok 18-19-20: Here are many religious students carrying staffs, belonging to katha and kalaapa
branches of Yajurveda, who being always engaged in studying the sacred scriptures, do not perform
any other austerities but are highly honoured by even noble men, are inactive( in the sense, they
do not move out for alms) and crave for sweets. Cause them to be given eighty carts loaded with
jewels, a thousand bullocks carrying loads of rice and two hundred bullocks used for cultivation.
Give a thousand cows for use in their nourishment, Oh Lakshmana!"

Shlok 21: "Oh, Lakshmana! Many celebates wearing fillets stand near Kausalya, cause them to be
given a thousand cows each."

Shlok 22: "Honour all those brahmanas in every way, so that my mother Kausalya will feel happy
to see my gifts."

Shlok 23: Then, Lakshmana the tiger among men himself gave that wealth, like Kubera, to the
best of brahmanas as instructed.

Shlok 24: Rama, after giving abundant wealth to each one of the dependents, standing there
with tears in their throats, spoke to them as follows;

Shlok 25: "Till my return, the house belonging to Lakshmana and also this house which is
occupied by me, should be guarded by each one of you, by turn."

Shlok 26: Having thus ordered those servants distressed as they were, he instructed his
treasurer as follows: "Let my wealth be brought(here)."

Shlok 27: Thereafter, the servants brought all the wealth of Rama. That very large heap of
wealth there appeared good-looking.

Shlok 28: Rama, the tiger among men, along with Lakshmana then caused that wealth to be
distributed among the brahmanas, the children, the old-aged and the pitiable.

Shlok 29: "There lived a brahmana by name Trijata who was born in garga community and was
reddish born in colour. He used to make his living in the forest by digging the soil, always
carrying an axe, a spade and a plough."

Shlok 30: His young wife, having been afflicted with poverty, taking her small children with
her, spoke to that aged brahmana as follows:

Shlok 31: "Throw away the axe and the spade. Carry out my word. Seek for the presence of Rama
who knows his duty and see if you get at least something."

Shlok 32: He heard the request of his wife, wrapped a strip of cloth that could hardly cover
his body and set out towards the track wherein lies Rama's palace.

Shlok 33: Up to the fifth gate, none in that society of men could obstruct this Trijata, who
was equal in spiritual splendour with the sages Bhrigu and Angira.

Shlok 34: That Trijata having approached the prince Rama, spoke the following words: "Oh, the
most illustrious prince! I am a destitute, having many children in my family. I always dwell in the
forest, with an occupation of digging the soil. Look to me, as you know."

Shlok 35: Thereupon, Rama replied jestingly to him as follows: " By me, even one thousand cows
were not given away so far. You will get as many cows to such an extent as you will throw this
staff."

Shlok 36: Winding his loin cloth round his waist hurrily and twirling his staff, he swiftly
threw it with all his strength, excited as he was.

Shlok 37: Flying away from his hand and crossing across the Sarayu river, that staff fell
close to a bull amidst a flock of cows numbering in several thousands.

Shlok 38: Embracing him, Rama of virtuous mind caused to be delivered to Trijata's hermitage
the cows up to that bank of Sarayu.

Shlok 39: Thereupon, Rama pacifyingly spoke to that son of Gargi as follows: "You need not
express your contempt, for this was only a jest indulged in by me."

Shlok 40: "I only desired to know your strength, which is unfathomable and hence this trial
for you. If you desire any other thing, opt for it."

Shlok 41: " I am telling the truth here. There is no limitation for you. Whatever riches
belonging to me, are indeed for brahmanas. If the wealth earned by me is given abundantly to you,
it will bring in joy and fame."

Shlok 42: Thereupon, Trijata along with his wife accepted that flock of cows and were
delighted. Then, he pronounced on Rama the virtuous man, the blessings to enhance reputation,
strength, delight and happiness.

Shlok 43: Rama being inspired by the befitting words of honour and having his heart satisfied,
immediately bestowed on friendly people, a great wealth earned by righteous might.

Shlok 44: At that time in Ayodhya, there was no brahmana, relative, dependant, pauper or
mendicant who was not satiated with befittingly deserving honour, gifts and respect.

SARGA 33
------------------------------

[Text] Rama while going to his father at Queen Kaikeyi's palace listens the people's voice
of sorrow for his exile. They sadly express their heartfelt feelings. On reaching the palace, Rama
bids Sumantra to inform Dasharatha about his arrival for paying respects at the time of
departure.

Shlok 1: Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha gave away abundant riches to brahmanas and went
along with Seetha to see their father.

Shlok 2: Those weapons held by Rama and Lakshmana were tied on with garlands by Seetha. The
weapons thus decorated were shining brilliantly and were fearful to look at.

Shlok 3: Then, wealthy people ascended lofty palatial mansions, large buildings and tops of
palaces of seven stories high and saw them spiritlessly,

Shlok 4: The streets were indeed difficult to walk, congested as they were, with many men.
For that reason, being in distress, they were seeing Rama by ascending lofty palatial
buildings.

Shlok 5: Then, by seeing Rama as a pedestrian without an umbrella, the people with their
hearts struck by grief were uttering words of many sorts.

Shlok 6: The same Sri Rama who was followed by a strong four wings of army(comprising
elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry), is walking lonely with Seetha followed by
Lakshmana.

Shlok 7: Rama knew the taste of sovereignty. He can grant desires to the desirous. Even then,
because of his respect for virtue, he is careful not to believe his father's words.

Shlok 8: Even people walking on road are able to see Seetha, who could not earlier be seen
even by beings going through the air.

Shlok 9: Rain, heat and cold will quickly wane to pallor Seetha, who was fond of applying
suitable cosmetics and red sandal to the body.

Shlok 11: How banishment can be affected on a son, even devoid of virtues? Why to tell further
of whom, this world is conquered merely by his mode of conduct?

Shlok 12: Harmlessness, compassion, learning, good nature, self-control and tranquillity -
these six virtues adorn Rama, the best of men.

Shlok 13: Therefore, people are extremely painful for the injury done to him, as aquatic
beings in summer are afflicted because of depletion of water.

Shlok 14: The entire world feels afflicted by the hardship inflicted on this protector of the
world, as a tree which acquired flowers and fruits is damaged by injury caused to its root.

Shlok 15: This Rama, the essence of virtue possessing great lustre, is indeed the root of the
tree of humanity. Other men are his flowers, fruits and branches.

Shlok 16: We as such along with our wives and relatives atone will follow Rama in the same way
as Lakshmana is going with the departing Rama.

Shlok 17: Abandoning gardens fields and houses, we shall follow Rama the righteous man, and
share his joys and sorrows.

Shlok 18-19-20-21: Let Kaikeyi obtain the houses deserted by us, their treasures unearthed, their
court-yards in ruined state, their wealth and food grains removed, their best parts robbed off from
all sides, covered by dust, deserted by the deities(presiding them), overrun by mice, coming out of
their holes and turning round here and there, without water and smoke, upswept, the rises of
offering oblations to all creatures as well as the sacred fire, worship of gods, the chanting of
sacred texts and muttering of prayers having altogether ceased, as though dilapidated by adverse
times and scattered with broken vessels.

Shlok 22: As Rama is going away to the forest, let that forest become a city and let this city
being deserted by us become a forest.

Shlok 23: Scared by fear of us, let all the snakes abandon their holes, the dears and birds
the mountain peaks, the elephants and the lions the forest itself. let them leave the region going
to be inhabited by us and reach the city of Ayodhya.

Shlok 24-25: Let Kaikeyi with her son along with her relatives indeed inhabit the region where
ferocious animals and vultures live with grass, meat and fruits. Let us all (on the other hand)
live happily in the forest along with Rama.

Shlok 26: Rama heard various kinds of remarks thus made by many people. Hearing them also, his
mind was not disturbed.

Shlok 27: That Rama the virtuous man, by walking with strides of an elephant in rut,
approached his father's palace, which from a distance glowed like a peak of the Kailasa
mountain.

Shlok 28: After entering the royal palace, which had in it disciplined and valiant attendants,
saw Sumantra standing dejected not far from the palace.

Shlok 29: The, Rama even on seeing the people disturbed, appeared unmoved and smiling,
intending to fulfill his father's behest and went to see his father.



Seeing Sumantra appearing disturbed before that, Rama the son of Dasaratha( a scion
of Ikshhvaaku) whose mind is mighty and who is setting out to the forest, waited awhile to have his
presence announced to his father.

Shlok 31: That Rama, who had passion towards piety, having made up his mind positively to
enter the exile as per his father's command, spoke thus, seeing Sumantra, "Inform my arrival to the
king."



Thus completes 33rd chapter of Ayodhya Kanda in glorious Ramayana, the work of a

SARGA 34
------------------------------

[Text] Rama comes to see his father Dasharatha and Dasharatha summons Sumantra to fetch all
his wives to hither, and asks Rama to stay with him at least for a night. But Rama resolved in his
vow, persuades his father to be peaceful. Dasharatha's anguish intensifies and he swoons at the
departure of Rama.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, the lotus-eyes Rama, who was dark-brown in complexion and great beyond
compare, spoke thus to the charioteer, "Tell about me to my father."

Shlok 2: Quickly entering inside, when sent by Rama, the charioteer saw the king having
sighs, his senses disturbed by grief.

Shlok 3: He saw the king resembling an eclipsed sun, like fire covered by ash, as a lake
without water.

Shlok 4: The charioteer, a great intellectual, saw Dasaratha repenting with his mind greatly
agitated and approached him with joined palms.

Shlok 5: The charioteer, first inspiring the king with blessings of triumph, spoke thus in a
slow and sweet voice, overcome with fear.

Shlok 6: "Your son, the tiger among men, having given away all his wealth to brahmanas and
dependents, is waiting at the gate."

Shlok 7: "May auspiciousness betide you! Let that Rama, who is unfailingly brave, see you.
After bidding farewell to all friends, he wants to see you now."

Shlok 8: "Oh, king! Rama is setting out to a great forest. See him who is resembling a sun
with rays of light, displaying royal qualities."

Shlok 9: That king Dasaratha, who speaks truth, whose mind is virtuous, who is like an ocean
by his depth of character and who is blemish less like a sky, replied to Sumantra as follows:

Shlok 10: "Oh, Sumantra! being all my wives, who are here. Surrounded by all of them, I want
to see the virtuous Rama."

Shlok 11: Sumantra, after entering the gynaecium, spoke these words to those women as follows:
"Oh, the venerable ladies! The king is calling you. Go there without delay.

Shlok 12: All those women, asked thus by Sumantra as per the king's orders, went to his
palace, after knowing the instructions of their husband.

Shlok 13: Encircling Kausalya, three hundred fifty women, steadfast in their vow(of devotion
to their husband), with their eyes reddened, went there slowly.

Shlok 14: After arrival of his wives, king Dasaratha spoke to that charioteer as follows, "Oh,
Sumantra! Bring my son here."

Shlok 15: Taking Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, that charioteer then speedily went to the king's
presence.

Shlok 16: King Dasaratha surrounded by women, seeing from a distance his son coming with
folded hands, distressed as he was, rose swiftly from his seat.

Shlok 17: Seeing Rama, King Dasaratha ran speedily towards him. But without reaching him he
fell on the floor senseless, afflicted as he was with sorrow.

Shlok 18: Then, Rama and Lakshmana an eminent car-warrior, quickly approached that king who
seemed unconscious with full of grief as he was, through agony.

Shlok 19: Sounds of thousands of women crying "Alas! Alas! Oh Rama!" generated all at once
from the royal palace, mixed with the sound of tinkling ornaments.

Shlok 20: Holding Dasaratha in their arms and crying, both Rama and Lakshmana along with
Seetha laid him on the couch.

Shlok 21: Then, Rama with folded hands spoke thus to king Dasaratha who got consciousness
within a short time and who was inundated in a sea of sorrow.

Shlok 22: "Oh, emperor! I take leave of you, who are the lord of all of us. See auspiciously
towards me, who am about to leave for Dandaka forest."

Shlok 23: "Permit Lakshmana also and Seetha too who is accompanying me to the forest. Even if
prevented(by me0 on many true reasons, these two are not agreeing to stay behind"

Shlok 24: "Giving up grief, Oh the bestower of honour, grant leave to all of us, Lakshmana
myself and Seetha as Brahma(the lord of creation) did to his sons(sanaka and his three brothers who
intended to go to forest for practising austerities)."

Shlok 25: Gazing at Rama who is unruffled, awaiting permission of the king for stay in the
forest, the king Dasaratha spoke thus:

Shlok 26: "Oh, Rama! I was stupefied by Kaikeyi through a boon. Now, by confining me, be you
the king of Ayodhya."

Shlok 27: When told thus by the king, Rama the best man in supporting righteousness and who is
proficient in expression, replied( as follows) to his father, after making salutation with joined
palms.

Shlok 28: "Oh, king! You be the ruler of the earth for thousand years. But, I for my part,
will stay in the forest. For my sake, do not generate untruth about you."

Shlok 29: "Oh, ruler of men! Having strolled in the forest for fourteen years, I shall clasp
your feet once more after fulfilling my promise."

Shlok 30: Prompted secretly by kaikeyi, the distressed king, tied up by fetters of truth, said
weeping to that beloved son.

Shlok 31: "Oh, darling! Proceed for welfare, for advancement and for coming again. Let your
path of travel be auspicious, undistracted and fearless from any quarter."

Shlok 32: "Oh, darling, the seion of Raghu! Truthful as you are by nature and your mind being
given to righteousness, your decision cannot be reversed."

Shlok 33: "Oh, son! Do not leave in any case today, now at night time. Even by seeing you for
one day, I may live happily."

Shlok 34: "Looking at your mother and myself, stay at least for this night today. Satiated by
all the desired objects, you may leave tomorrow at dawn."

Shlok 35: "Oh Rama, my son! An incorrigible thing is being done by you since for my pleasure
you are going to the forest a solitary place, leaving beloved ones."

Shlok 36: "Oh Rama my son! Your exile is not agreeable to me. I was cheated by Kaikeyi who had
concealed intentions and resembled fire with ashes."

Shlok 37: Incited by Kaikeyi who has destroyed established customs, you wish to redeem my
deceit, derived by me from her.

Shlok 38: "It is not a great surprise, my son, that you my eldest son should seek to make your
father as one who does not have false promises."

Shlok 39: After hearing these words of their father who was depressed, Rama and Lakshmana were
upset. Then Rama spoke these words.

Shlok 40: Even if these worldly pleasures are obtained today, who will offer those things to
me tomorrow? Therefore I desire only to get away in lieu of all these enjoyments.

Shlok 41: "This earth being relinquished by me; which included various provinces, filled with
people, imbued with riches and food grains, may be given to Bharata."

Shlok 42: "I cannot budge now from my decision made about my stay in the forest. Oh king the
bestower of boons! You were pleased to give a boon to Kaikeyi and let it be fulfilled completely.
Be you a truthful man."

Shlok 43: "I , as promised, fulfilling your command, shall live in the forest along with
forest-dwellers for fourteen years."

Shlok 44-45: "Oh, king! Do not have any hesitation in offering the kingdom to Bharata. Neither
kingdom nor happiness indeed is desired by my nature. It is dear to me only to do your command as
directed."

Shlok 46: "Let your sorrow disappear! Do not be overwhelmed with tears. The ocean, the lord of
rivers which is difficult to assail, indeed does not get agitated."

Shlok 47: "I do not crave for kingdom or happiness nor again for Seetha nor even all these
enjoyments nor for heaven nor even for life."

Shlok 48: "Oh, Jewel among men! I wish you to be a truthful mean, not a fallacious man. I
swear to you in your presence by truth and by virtue."

Shlok 49: "It is not possible for me, Oh father, to stay on even for a moment. Therefore,
contain this grief, Oh Lord, for there is no going back upon my word."

Shlok 50: "Oh Dasaratha the seion of Raghu! I was indeed asked by Kaikeyi to go to the forest.
It was also replied by me that I would go. I shall redeem that pledge."

Shlok 51: "Oh, king! Do not feel anxious. We shall sport in the forest, flocked with peaceful
deer and rendered noisy by birds of various types."

Shlok 52: "Oh, father! It was indeed said that even for celestials, father is the god.
Therefore, I shall carry out the father's word, considering it as divine."

Shlok 53: "Oh father, the best among men! You will see me, when I come back after elapsing
fourteen years. Let this grief be given up."

Shlok 54: "Oh, tiger among men! Why have you got perturbed-you by whom all these people bathed
in tears, ought to be consoled?"

Shlok 55: "Let this city, province and whole of this earth left by me, be given to Bharata. I
for one following your instructions, shall proceed to the forest to dwell in it for long."

Shlok 56: "Oh, king! Let this earth with multitude of mountains, comprising of cities with
their gardens relinquished by me, be ruled over barely by Bharata, within the bounds of
righteousness. Let the word of honour given by you(to Kaikeyi) come true."

Shlok 57: "Oh, the faultless king! My mind is not directed on haughty physical enjoyments or
sensuous pleasures which is approved by the wise. Let your agony disappear, for my sake."

Shlok 58: Oh, the sinless king! Therefore, now associating you with untruth, I just do not
desire for kingdom, nor all the sensual enjoyments, nor happiness nor existence nor even Seetha.
Let your pledge(given to Kaikeyi) prove true."

Shlok 59: "I shall be happy, entering the forest filled with wonderful trees, eating fruits
and tubers as well as seeing mountains rivers and lakes in the forest. Let there be satisfaction
for you.

Shlok 60: Embracing his son, that king Dasaratha, who had thus fallen on evil days, was
tormented with grief and distress, got fainted, fully losing his consciousness and not moving even
a little.

Shlok 61: Then, all the queens assembled there except Kaikeyi began to cry. Sumantra also fell
into a swoon, while weeping. Everything there became loud lamenting.

SARGA 35
------------------------------

[Text] Minister Sumantra requests and reproaches Queen Kaikeyi and asks her to take back
her impositions. Even the elderly minister and a scholar named Siddhartha tries to pacify Kaikeyi
by telling the legend of Sagara, the ancestor of Dasharatha, quoting the exile of his notorious son
Asamanja. But she is adamant to all holy advices, but wants Rama to go to forests.

Shlok 1-2-3-4: Then, moving his head all of a sudden sighing again and again, rubbing his hand in
hand, grinding his teeth, turning his eyes red with anger shedding his normal colour, overwhelmed
with wrath, suddenly getting the evil grief, carefully reading Dasaratha's mind, sumantra the
charioteer spoke(as follows) as though shaking Kaikeyi's heart with sharp arrows, in the form of
thunderbolting words speedily peircing all her vitals.

Shlok 5: "There is nothing on earth, anything which is most disgraceful for you by whom your
husband king Dasaratha the supporter of the entire creation the unmoving and the moving, is
betrayed, Oh, Kaikeyi!"

Shlok 6-7: "King Dasaratha is unconquerable as great Indra, unshakable as mountain and
imperturbable as a great ocean. By tormenting him with your actions, you are considered by me as
murderess of your husband and ultimately the exterminator of your race too."

Shlok 8: "Do not despise Dasaratha the supporter, the bestower of boons and your husband. For
women, will of the husband is superior to that of ten million sons."

Shlok 9: "After death of a king, kingdoms are obtained as per the age of the princes. But,
you want to deprive this condition in the case of Rama the lord of Ikshvaku dynasty."

Shlok 10: "Let your son Bharata become the king and rule the earth. wherever Rama goes, we (on
our part) shall go there".

Shlok 11: "Now any brahmana cannot indeed dwell in your kigdom as now you want to do such an
act, transgressing the due limits."

Shlok 12-13: "Certainly, all of us will proceed in the path followed by Rama. Oh, queen Kaikeyi!
What pleasure will be derived through attainment of soverignity, when your relatives, all brahmanas
and pious souls desert you forever? Now, you want to do such an act of impropriety"

Shlok 14: "I am looking only with surprise, why the earth is not immediately rent asunder,
while you conduct yourself with such an act"

Shlok 15: "It is also surprising me why rods of reproaching words fiery and fearful to look at
uttered by great brahmana sages are not killing you, who are bent on sending Rama to exile."

Shlok 16: "Who will nurture a neem tree, cutting down a mango tree with an axe? And a neem
tree will not turn sweet for him who nourishes it with milk."

Shlok 17: "I think, by birth your nature is as exactly as that of your mother. a proverb is
quoted in the world saying that honey does not ooze from a neem tree."

Shlok 18-19: "We know, as heard of in the past, your mother's conduct of evil satisfaction.
Someone capable of giving boons, granted a great boon to your father. By that boon he could
identify the language of all created beings. The talk of those beings belonging to sub human
species could be known by him."

Shlok 20: "From the sound of an ant called Jrimbha near his bed, the meaning of that sound was
deciphered by your exceedingly brilliant father and he laughed over it repeatedly."

Shlok 21: Your mother, becoming angry over his laugh, wishing even to hand him to death(in
case he refuses to disclose the reason for his laughter), spoke thus: "Oh king, the gentle sir! I
want to know the meaning of your laughter."

Shlok 22: "The king replied to that queen as follows: "Oh, royal lady! If I tell you the
reason of my laughter, my death will immediately follow thereafter. There is no doubt about
it."

Shlok 23: "Your mother then said to your father, the king of Kekayas, Live or die as you will.
tell me the laughter. Do not ridicule me."

Shlok 24: Having been spoken thus by his beloved consort, the said king of the Kekayas on his
part correctly reported the matter to the sage who had bestowed the boon on him.

Shlok 25: Then the sage who had bestowed the boon replied to the king as follows: "Oh, lord of
the earth! Let her die or ruin. Do not reveal the reason to her."

Shlok 26: "Having heard the words of that sage who was pure-minded, the king repudiated your
mother and lived happily like Kubera the Lord of riches."

Shlok 27: "Oh, Kaikeyi, seeing evil everywhere! You, too, thus following the path trodden by
wicked men, are making this bad resolution by ignorance."

Shlok 28: "The popular saying that males are born confirming to their fathers and females to
their mothers, occurs to me as true."

Shlok 29: Do not conform to the traits of your mother. Understand that which is said by the
king. following the desire of your husband, be a protectress to these people here."

Shlok 30: "Incitedby the evil minded, do not put before the public an improper course of
conduct of your husband who spendour is equal to that of king Devendra and who is a protector of
this world.

Shlok 31: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Dasaratha the faultless man, the majesty, the lotus-eyed man and the
king cannot indeed belie the promise given to you(Hence, you alone has to change your opinion)"

Shlok 32: "Let Rama the eldest(of the sons) who is generous strong skilled, capable of
protecting his own duty as Kshatriya but also of protecting the world of living beings, be
installed on the throne of Ayodhya"

Shlok 33: "Oh, Kaikeyi! A great accusation will surely roam about you in the world, if Rama
leaving his royal father goes to the forest.

Shlok 34: "Let Rama of that character protect this kingdom! Be you free from distress. There
is none other than Rama living in your excellent city who is competent to rule this Ayodhya"

Shlok 35: "In the event of Rama being installe din the office of the prince Regent, King
Dasaratha wielder of the great bow will surely have recourse to the forest, cherishly recollecting
the conduct of his forebears"

Shlok 36: Thus, Sumantra repeatedly with joint palms, caused a shaking to Kaikeyi in the royal
assmebly, by his kind words as well as bitter words.

Shlok 37: That queen Kaikeyi, however, was neither excited nor repented in her heart nor was
any change observed in the colour of her face.

------------------------------

[Text] Dasharatha orders to send army and treasury with Rama to forests. Kaikeyi objects to
such a lavish exile and she retorts the same legend of Sagara who exiled his son, Asamanja, without
riches. Minister Siddhartha still ties to persuade her. Then vexed King Dasharatha also tries to
embark on the exile along with Rama.

Shlok 1: Then, Dasaratha the scion of Ikshvaku dynasty, squeezed by his own promise in the
matter of sending Rama to exile, sighed heavily with tears and spoke the following words again and
agian to Sumantra.

Shlok 2: "Oh, Sumantra! Let a military body consisting of (all) the four limbs of the arms,
filled with the best of its kind, be arranged immediately"

Shlok 3: "Let courtesans well versed in speaking and merchants with great riches having
exposure for extension of sales bestow elegance to the forces of the Prince"

Shlok 4: Appoint in this contingent those too, by giving abundant money to them who were
dependent on Rama and on whom he took delight in gallantry"

Shlok 5: "Let important weapons, chiefs of police and vehicles, hunters knowing the secrets
of forest accompany Rama(scion of Kakutsa)"

Shlok 6: "Killing deer and elephants, drinking forest-honey, seeing various rivers, he would
not remember of sovereignty"

Shlok 7: "Let the granary and the treasury belonging to me be sent to Rama residing in the
uninhabited forest."

Shlok 8: "Rama can spend his exile happily, by performing sacrificial rite in holy places and
disbursing appropriate gifts, along with sages living in the forest "

Shlok 9: "The mighty armed Bharata will rule Ayodhya. Let the glorious Rama be sent alog with
all objects of enjoyment"

Shlok 10: While Dasartha was speaking thus, fear drew near Kaikeyi. Her mouth too also got
parched. her voice also got choked.

Shlok 11: Feeling depressed and apprehensive, with her mouth getthing parched and her face
turned towards the king, Kaikeyi spoke as follows:

Shlok 12: "Bharata will not accept the kingdom, which will become uninhabited, hollow and
which will be absolutely unenjoyable like wine, quaffed of its spiriteous part, Oh noble soul!"

Shlok 13: While Kaikeyi who has cast off her shame was thus uttering th emost cruel words,
King Dasaratha spoke these words to that lady with large eyes:

Shlok 14: Having charged me with a burden, Oh hostile woman, why do you prick me while I am
carrying it? Why did you not check before(while asking the boons by putting a condition that Rama
should not be allowed to take anything with him) the deed(of sending troups etc with Rama) in the
begining itself, Oh the vulgar woman!"

Shlok 15: Doubly enraged in hearing this angry question of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi the beautiful
woman replied to the king as follows:

Shlok 17: Spoken to as above, king Dasaratha uttered only a word "Shame!". The entire people
there were ashamed. But Kaikeyi did not perceive it"

Shlok 18: There, the aged and the upright chief minister siddhartha by name who was highly
esteemed by the king, spoke to Kaikeyi these words:

Shlok 19: "Asamanja the evil-minded, catching hold of children playing in the street and
throwing them in the waters of saryu river, took delight in it"

Shlok 20: By watching him, all the citizens were angry and spoke to the king, "choose either
to keep yourself Asamanja alone or to preserve us, Oh the promoter of the state!"

Shlok 21: Thereupon the king said to them, "For what reason is this fear? Duly asked by the
king, those people also replied these words:

Shlok 22: "He obtains incomparable delight by throwing, through stupidity, our playing
children in sarayu river in a whirled state of mind."

Shlok 23: Hearing the words of those poeple, that king abandoned the son repugnant to his
subjects, in a bid to do good to them.

Shlok 24: Arranging immediately to place him along with his wife together with the
paraphrenalia (like utensils, implements etc) in a vehicle, the king instructed his persons thus:
"He should be exiled for life."

Shlok 25: Roaming in all directions as though he has done sinful deeds, he ransacked mountain
passes, by taking a basket and a shovel.

Shlok 26: "The highly righteous King Sagara abandoned Asamanja for perpetration sinful deeds
as above. But, what sin Rama has done, for which he was debarred in this way?"

Shlok 27: We do not indeed perceive any fault in Rama. It is as difficult to find a taint in
him as in a new moon.

Shlok 28: "Or if you see any fault in Rama, Oh Kaikeyi you tell about it now correctly. Then,
Rama will be exiled."

Shlok 29: As it is contradictory to righteousness to abandon one who is guilty and who is
devoted to a good path, it would consume the splendour of even Indra (the ruler of gods)

Shlok 30: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Hence, there is no need of impeding the royal fortune of Rama. Oh,
lady with a charming face! Even blame from the public should be taken care of by you."

Shlok 31: Hearing the words of Siddhartha, king Dasaratha spoke to Kaikeyi in the most
tiresome tone, with a voice choked with deep anguish, as follows.

Shlok 32: "Oh, the sinful being! Do you not agree with these words of Siddhartha? By resorting
to the path of the deplorable, you with a bad behaviour, are not alive to my interests or to your
own. Your action is deprived of a righteous path."

Shlok 33: "I am accompanying Rama now, by abandoning my kingdom, happiness and wealth. You
enjoy the kingdom for a long time, happily together with Bharata the King."



Thus completes 36th chapter in the Ayodhya Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of
Valmiki, the work of a sage and the oldest epic.

[Text] Jute-cloths that are befitting to sages and saints are brought in for the three at
the behest of Kaikeyi. Rama and Lakshmana accept and wear them. But Seetha, as a par excellent
princess of Mithila, is baffled in wearing them and when she is irksome as how to tie and toggle
them, Rama goes to her and demonstrates how to wear them, on her silken robes. Seeing that
situation, all the womenfolk in the palace chamber wail for the hardship befallen on Seetha.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of the chief minister, Rama who was well-versed in courtesy, spoke
then to Dasaratha as follows:

Shlok 2: "Of what use for me, who have forsaken enjoyments, cast away attachment for
everything and am going to live in the forest on nomadic food, Oh king, with an army accompanying
me?"

Shlok 3: "Who, after giving away a first-class elephant, will work out his mind on a rope
with which it is tied? What use is there for him through attachment to the rope after abandaning
the excellent elephant?"

Shlok 4: "Oh, the best among good men! So also, what use is there for me by the army Oh,
King, when I am giving away absolutely all. Let the dresses of a mendicant be brought to me.'

Shlok 5: "I am going to reside in the abode of forest for fourteen years. Bring a shoel and a
basket both for me."

Shlok 6: Thereupon, Kaikeyi shamelessly bringing personally of men, said to Rama; "Put these
on"

Shlok 7: Taking those two pieces of bark (as loin cloth and cover) from kaikeyi and
discarding his clothing of fine yarn, Rama put on the garb of ascetics.

Shlok 8: Lakshmana too there itself before his father put on the clothing of ascetics, by
discarding his beautiful raiment.

Shlok 9: Then, Seetha who wore silken clothing, by seeing the piece of bark intended to be
worne by her, felt alarming as a deer would on seeing a snare(set for entrapping)

Shlok 10-11: Feeling abashed while taking the wearing apparel made of Kusa grass and greatly
troubled in mind, Seetha who bore auspicious marks knew what is righteousness who was an
illustration of righteousness spoke these words with her eyes filled with tears to her husband who
looked like Chitraratha(the king of Gandharvas)

Shlok 12: "How ascetics residing in the forest wear this piece of bark?" Thus saying, Seetha
who was not adept in wearing the bark of trees, erred again and again(in her attempt to wear
it)

Shlok 13: Keeping one piece of bark on her neck as well as holding it with her hand, Seetha
stood abashed, not adept as she was in wearing it.

Shlok 14: Rama, the foremost of those upholding virute, quicky came and personally fastened
that bark over the sild garment of Seetha.

Shlok 15: Seeing the greatest Rama fastening the bark to Seetha in that manner, the women in
the gynaecium shed tears from their eyes.

Shlok 16: Very much distress as they were, they spoke to Rama of dazzling glory as follows: "
Dear child! This Seetha the high sould, was not so commanded to reside in the forest."

Shlok 17: "When you departed to the forest in seclusion following the words of your father, Oh
Rama, let her sight be a reward to us till your return."

Shlok 18: " You go to the forest along with Lakshmana as your companion Oh son! Seetha the
beautiful girl is not fit to reside in a forest like an ascetic."

Shlok 19: "Accept our prayer, Oh son! Let Seetha the beautiful young lady stay here. Indeed,
you the ever righteous in any case do not wish to stay back.

Shlok 20: Even after hearing their words in this manner, Rama fastened that piece of bark to
Seetha, who has a well-matched nature.

Shlok 21: Seeing Seetha accepting the piece of bark, Vasistha the king's preceptor prevented
her and spoke thus to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 22: "Oh the evil minded Kaikeyi, who have exceeded your limits, who have brought
disgrace to your family! You are not establishing justifiable standard and you misled the king.

Shlok 23: "Oh, the woman without decorum! Seetha the princess shall not proceed to forest. She
will occuply the throne, which was awarded to Rama."

Shlok 24: "A wife is very self to all, who constantly care for their wives. As Seetha is
Rama's self, she can rule the earth."

Shlok 25: "Or rather, if Seetha goes to forest together with Rama, we also will follow suit.
This city too will go."

Shlok 26: "The fronitier- guards and the State including its patrons, as well as this city
with its goods and chattels will go whereever Rama and his wife are there."

Shlok 27: "Wearing pieces of bark, Bharata along with Shatrughna will live along with Rama
their brother residing in the forest and moving in the forest."

Shlok 28: Thereafter, singly you alone with bad conduct hurt to people, rule this earth which
is bereft of people and desolate, with its trees alone remaining.

Shlok 29: "Where Rama is not a king, that place will not indeed become on kingdom. That
forest, where Rama will be living, can become a kingdom."

Shlok 30: "If Bharata is born to king Dasaratha, he is not fit either to rule the earth that
is not being offered by his father nor to live as a son in your case."

Shlok 31: "Even if you can jump from the surface of the earth to the sky, Bharata who knows
the record of his father's dynasty will not do as you wish him to do"

Shlok 32: "therefore, an unfriendly act(alone) has been done by you, eventhough you are
covetons towards his well-being. There is none indeed in this world who is not devoted to Rama"

Shlok 33: "Oh, Kaikeyi! You will see now itself that beasts, elephants, deers and birds going
with Rama and trees also turning their faces towards Rama."

Shlok 34: "Moreover, putting aside the bark of trees, give excellent jewellery to your
daughter-in-law, Oh, Kaikeyi! the bark of trees is not ordained for her" Thus saying so, Vasishta
prevented that wearing of garment by Seetha.

Shlok 35: "Oh, Kaikeyi! It was solicited by you, the dwelling in the forest of Rama only. Let
Seetha, to be decorated daily, be adorned with ornaments and live in the forest along with
Rama."

Shlok 36: "Let Seetha go with excellent conveyances, well accompanied by attendants, with all
costumes and useful accessories. Her exile was not indeed solicted by you, while asking for
boons"

Shlok 37: Eventhough Vasista, the preceptor of the king, who had an influenc beyond compare
and the best of brahmanas was speaking as above, Seetha did not turn away here resolution to follow
the ways of her beloved husband.



Thus completes thirty seventh chapter of ayodhya Kanda in glorious Valmiki Ramayana,

------------------------------

[Text] Dasharatha is enraged to see his precious daughter-in-law in rags and takes Kaikeyi
to task. Rama seeks blessings of his father for departure and requests him to keep his mother
Kausalya, who is aging, comfortable.

Shlok 1: On seeing Seetha wearing bark of trees like a helpless woman, eventhough protected
by her husband all the people there loudly cried out: "Fie upon you, Dasaratha!"

Shlok 2: Pained by that loud cry there, King Dasaratha lost interest in his life, religious
merit and esteem.

Shlok 3: Dasaratha with a warm sigh, spoke to his wife these words. "Oh, Kaikeyi! Seetha does
not deserve to go with a robe made of Kusa grass."

Shlok 4: "My preceptro truly says that Seetha, who is delicate young and ever habituated to
comforts, is not fit for forest-life"

Shlok 5: "has this pitiable daughter of Janaka, the jewel of kings, done any harm to any one
that, having obtained a bark of tree she is standing like a hermitess dumbfounded in the midst of
men?"

Shlok 6: "Seetha the daughter of Janaka need not wear these barks of trees. No such pledge
was given be me earlier. hence, let this prinecess go to the forest happily fully provided ewith
all valuable possesssions."

Shlok 7: "A Cruel pledge has been made on oath by me, who do not deserve to survive. This
(providing robes of hermitess to Seetha) has been initiated by you by sheer childishness. That will
consume me, as by its own flower to a bamboo."

Shlok 8: "Oh evil woman! (Even) supposing a little offence is done by Rama to you, what harm
was displayed to you here by Seetha? Oh, mean woman!"

Shlok 9: "What harm on earth can be done to you by Seetha, who has blooming eyes like those
of a female deer, soft in disposition a practiser of penance?"

Shlok 10: "Oh, the evil woman! Sending Rama to exile thus indeed is enough for you. What use
is there for you in further doing these wretched, sinful acts too.

Shlok 11: "Hearing the speech you gave to Rama who came here for coronation, only that much
was acceded by me, Oh queen!"

Shlok 12: "Transgressing all that, you somehow or other wish to go to hell, by perceiving
Seetha also clad in bark of trees.

Shlok 13: That high-souled king thus lamenting, did not see any ending to that sorrow.
Drenched as he was in excessive devotion to his son and having been hurt vey much, he fell down on
the ground.

Shlok 14: Rama, who was setting out to the forest, spoke these words to his father, who was
speaking thus bowing down his head, sitting there.

Shlok 15: "Oh, virtuous king! This glorious Kausalya, my mother is aged. She is not of base
nature and will not accuse you.

Shlok 16: "Oh, the bestower of boons! You are worthy of amply respection her, who is deprived
of me, who is immersed in an ocean of sorrow and who has not see such an affliction earlier."

Shlok 17: "Having been honoured by you the venerable man, she the pitiable woman will not get
such a grief for her son, thinking of me alone and she will draw breath in you."

Shlok 18: "Oh, the king akim to the mighty Indra the ruler of gods! You must see that my
mother, who has high affection towards her son, will not depart to the house of Yama the God of
Death, by abandoning her life being emaciated by grief after my departure for the forest."

[Text] Sumantra arranges for a chariot for the travel of Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana at the
orders of Dasharatha. Kingly ornaments are obtained for Seetha. Rama seeks blessings from his
mother Kausalya and others too. Kausalya's parting advises to Seetha.

Shlok 1-2: Hearing Rama's words and seeing him clad in a garb of hermit, king Dasaratha with
his wives fell unconscious. Consumed by grief, he could not look towards Rama. Troubled in mind as
he was, the king could not speak to Rama by seeing into his face.

Shlok 3: The mighty armed Dasaratha was unconscious for some time, distressed and repented in
various ways thinking of Rama alone.

Shlok 4: "I think that previously many people were separated from their children by me or in
any case many living beings were killed. Hence, this (calamity) has befallen me."

Shlok 5-6: "life does not decamp from the body surely without the arrival of time. Death does
not claim me, even being tormented by Kaikeyi and eventhough I behold my son, efflugent as fire,
standing before me clad in the robes of an ascetic having cast off his fine garments."

Shlok 7: "All these people are suffering on account of only Kaikeyi, who sought refuge in
chincanery, with an implicit intent of selfishness"

Shlok 8: Having uttered these words and saying "Oh, Rama!" only once, he was not able to
speak any more, his organs of voice being choked by tears.

Shlok 9: Regaining consciousness after a moment, the king, with his eyes filled with tears,
spoke these words to Sumantra:

Shlok 10: "You come with a chariot, fit for driving, yoked with excellent horses and take this
highly distinguished prince beyond this territory."

Shlok 11: "Since a pious and a valiant son is being sent to exile by father and mother, I
think such is said to be the reward of virtues of the virtueous."

Shlok 12: Sumantra obeying the words of the king, walked away quickly and arrived there fitted
with horses, a chariot duly decorated.

Shlok 13: The charioteer told the prince with joined palms about that chariot decorated by
gold, fitted wih superb horses.

Shlok 14: The king, who knew what should be done at a proper place and time and was clear by
all means, quickly called an officer placed in charge of the treasury and spoke in a decisive tone
(as follows);-

Shlok 15: "Quickly bring for Seetha, clothings of great worth and ornaments of high quality,
taking into consideration all these years (that Seetha has to spend in exile)

Shlok 16: After thus spoken by the king, the officer went to the treasury, brought all that in
a lot and gave to Seetha.

Shlok 17: Setting out as she was to the forest, Seetha of noble birth adorned her beautiful
limbs with those wonderful jewels.

Shlok 18: Seetha, beautifully adorned as she was, illumined that palace, as the sky in a
morning is illuminated by a rising sun.

Shlok 19: Embracing in her arms that princess of Mithila, who never behaved in self-pity, and
smelling her head(as a token of affection), her mother-in-law(Kausalya) spoke as follows:

Shlok 20: "Dishonest women, eventhough adored all the time by their husbands, cease to esteem
their husband who has come to pass into evil days, throughout this world."

Shlok 21: "Having enjoyed happiness in the past, they become spoiled and even desert their
husband, on obtaining even the least misfortune: such is the nature of (bad) women."

Shlok 22: "Young women, who are evil-minded, are untruthful in their disposition, are affected
by passion and their essence, incomprehensible. They get aversion within a moment."

Shlok 23: Neither a noble descent, nor an accomplishment, nor learning, nor a gift nor even
entertainment can capture the heart of women. They are unstbale of their heart indeed!"

Shlok 24: "But, for women established in good conduct, truthfulness, sacred learning and
mental quietness, their husband alone is the most sacred entity, the best of all."

Shlok 25: "My son who is being sent to the forest should not be despised by you. Even if he is
invested with riches or without riches, let him be a deity to you."

Shlok 26: perceiving her words, endowed with essence of righteousness and joining her palms,
Seetha replied to her mother-in-law standing in front of her, as follows:-

Shlok 27: "I shall do just all that, as your venerable self instructs me. I know how I should
behave towards my husband. I have also heard about it earlier."

Shlok 28: "Your venerable self is not worthy of equating me with evil women. I am unable to
deviate from virtue, even as a moon from the moonlight"

Shlok 29: "Vina (Indian lute) does not resonate without chords. Chariot does not move without
wheels. Now can a wife bereft of her husband, even if blessed with hundred children, will not lie
happily in comfort."

Shlok 30: "A father indeed gives a limited extent, a mother in a limited measure and a son in
moderation. Which woman, then, would not adore her husband, the bestower of unlimitedness!"

Shlok 31: "Having heard about the special and ordinary duties of a wife from the most
excellent women, how can I, as such, despise my husband, Oh venerable lady? Husband is indeed a
deity to women."

Shlok 32: Hearing Seetha's words, which touched her heart, Kausalya of pure mind suddenly
started shedding tears born of agony and delight.

Shlok 33: Rama, the most virtuous man, joining his palms, approached and spoke these words to
his mother, who is highly respected among all his mothers:

Shlok 34: "Oh, mother! You do not grieve. You look after my father. The end of exile will come
rather soon."

Shlok 35: "Fourteen years will elapse, while you are asleep. you as such, will see me, duly
arrived here in my entire being, surrounded by my well-wishers."

Shlok 36: Uttering the aforesaid words of such quality and appropriate meaning to his mother,
Rama thought once again and gazed at his three hundred and fifty step-mothers.

Shlok 37: Rama joined his palms and saluted those step mothers also, who were too distressed
in the same way and spoke these words which were in consonance with the spirit of
righteousness.

Shlok 38: "Please excuse me, if I have done any mistake either becuase of our living together
or due to ignorance on my part. I now take leave of you all."

Shlok 39: All those women, whose mind was overpowered with grief, heard the aforesaid cool
submission of Rama, which was in consonance with righteousness.

Shlok 40: While Rama was speaking thus, an outery, resembling the wail of female cranes arose
from those wives of Dasaratha.

Shlok 41: Dasaratha' s palace, which was earlier resounding with tomtoms, large drums and
Meghas( musical instruments which sound like rumbling of clouds) was now filled with wails and
cries and fallen on evil days.

------------------------------

[Text] The departure of Rama from Ayodhya for his exile is depicted. When they are
charioted through the streets of Ayodhya the citizenry wails and weeps for Rama's disposition. In
his unsurpassable affection towards Rama, King Dasharatha follows the chariot like a commoner, but
fails to go further and falls down.

Shlok 1: Then, Rama Seetha and Lakshmana, who felt miserable, bowed down by touching the feet
of the king and went round him clockwise with joined palms.

Shlok 2: After taking leave of Dasaratha, Rama who knew what is right and stood confounded by
sorrow, bowed along with Seetha to Kausalya.

Shlok 3: Immediately following his brother, Lakshmana too bowed to Kausalya, then clasped the
feet of his mother Sumitra.

Shlok 4: Smelling (as a token of affection) the head of Lakshmana mighty armed, who was
saluting her, his mother Sumitra who wished well of him, spoke weepin, to that son of her ( as
follows)

Shlok 5: "Highly fond of your kinsman Rama, you have been pemitted (by me) to dwell in the
forest(with your eldest half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother). Do not neglect your
half-brother Rama, who is going to the forest, my son!"

Shlok 6: "Oh, sinless one! Whether in adversity or in riches, he alone is refugee to you. It
should become the code of conduct in the world, that younger brother should be subject to the
control of his elder brother."

Shlok 7: "It is indeed a practice right from ancient times in your race, to make gifts, to
dedicate onself to performance of sacrificial rites and to foresake one's body to fight
battles."

Shlok 8: Thus speaking to Lakshmana, who was in readiness to leave the forest and who loved
Rama dearly, Sumitra repeatedly said to him, "fare forth, fare forth!"

Shlok 9: "Know Rama to be Dasaratha. Look upon Seetha the daughter of Janaka as myself.
Consider the forest as Ayodhya and depart happily, my son!"

Shlok 10: Then, Sumantra the humble man, who was aware of humility, joined his palms and spoke
these words to Rama even as Matali(charioteer of Indra) would to Indra (the ruler of gods).

Shlok 11: "Mount the chariot, oh the highly illustrious prince! May all be well with you! I
shall take you speedily, wherever you direct me to go."

Shlok 12: "you have to reside in the forest for fourteen years. Those years, as directed by
the queen, are to be considered having commenced."

Shlok 13: Having adorned herself, Seetha with her comely buttocks, mounted with a delighted
mind, that chariot which was shining like the sun.

Shlok 14: Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers quickly mounted that chariot, which was
replendent like fire and decked with gold.

Shlok 15: For Seetha who was accompanying with her husband, Dasaratha gave away garments and
jewellery, taking into consideration the period for which she had to stay in the forest.

Shlok 16- 17: Even so for the two brothers, keeping the sets of weapon, an armour of hard make
with leather-cover in the midst of the chariot, Sumantra saw the three of whom Seetha constituted
the third mounted and quickly drove the horses which were highly admired, with their swiftness
resembling the velocity of wind.

Shlok 18: Rama after departing to the great forest for a long term, unconsciousness prevailed
in the city. There was faintness in the strength of people.

Shlok 19: The city( of Ayodhya) is filled with flurry, with its elephants intoxicated in rut
and highly excited and resonant with tinkling of ornaments of horses.

Shlok 20: That city, including the youngsters and the old, stricken with extreme agony, ran
towards Rama alone, in the same way as the one afflicted with heat of the sun rushes towards
water.

Shlok 21: Having down towards sides and back of the chariot with their faces turned towards
Rama and with their faces filled with tears, all those people said with loud voices to Sumantra
thus:

Shlok 22: "Hold in the reins of the horses and go slowly and slowly, Oh charioteer! We would
behold the face of Rama, which would be henceforth difficult to behold for us"

Shlok 23: "The heart of Rama's mother(Kausalya) is surely and undoubtedly made of iron, since
it does not get broken when Rama resembling an offspring of gods is going to the forest"

Shlok 24: "Seetha(the princess of Videha kingdom) has done what ought to be done, by going
along with him like a shadow, delighted in virtue as she was and does not leave her husband in the
same way as Mount Meru does not leave the efflugence of sun"

Shlok 25: "Oh, Lakshmana! You are attending ever to your brother who speaks affectionately and
is equal to the god. Ah, you are the accomplisher of purpose!"

Shlok 26: "It is an immense fulfilment for you, it is a tremendous good fortune for you, nay,
it is even a means to heaven that you are following this Rama"

Shlok 27: Saying so, those people were not able to restrain their tears that come and followed
that Rama, their beloved delight of the Ikshvakus.

Shlok 28: Then, the king with the distressed mind, saying that he would behold his beloved
saw, came out of his palace surrounded by women who were too dejected.

Shlok 29: In front of him was heard a huge noise of crying women, echoing like trumpeting of
female elephants when a lordly elephant has been pinioned.

Shlok 30: At that time, the father of Rama as is well known as a glorious king Dasaratha(a
scion of Kakutstha) looked shrunk, like the full moon oversadowed by an eclipse.

Shlok 31: That glorious son of Dasaratha(Rama) of inconceivable courage, directed the
charioteer in the words "Let the chariot be driven fast."

Shlok 32: Rama commanded that charioteer with the words "Move on!" The people said to him
"stop!" Urged on the passage, the charioteer could not do both.

Shlok 33: The dust raised on the road due to moving out of mighty armed Rama, was suppressed
by the falling tears of the citizens.

Shlok 34: With full of wailing tears, the citizens of after making loud cries became
unconscious with deep agony, at the time of departure of Rama.

Shlok 35: Tears born of anguish flowed from the eyes of women like(drops of) water falling
from lotuses by the commotion of fish.

Shlok 36: Seeing the city with singleness of mind, the glorious monarch Dasaratha fell down
with agony, like a tree slain at its root.

Shlok 37: Thereafter, seeing the king becoming feeble and much distressed, the outery of the
people rose from the rear of Rama.

Shlok 38: Some poeple crying "Oh, Rama!" and some other scrying "Oh, Rama's mother!", made the
entire women in the gynaecium to weap.

Shlok 39: Looking back, Rama saw the king sorrowful and perplexed in mind, as well as his
mother following (him) on the road.

Shlok 40: Rama, bound by the chord of righteousness, could not gaze openly at his parents, as
a foal caught in asnare would not properly look at its dam.

Shlok 41: Seeing them coming by foot, though worthy of a chariot, habituated to comfort and
unworthy of suffering, Rama commanded the charioteer with words: "Drive fast!"

Shlok 42: Rama the tiger among men, feeling pained, as an elephant being pricked by a good,
indeed was not able to bear that plight of his father and his mother.

Shlok 43: Rama's mother (Kausalya) ran towards her son, as a cow fond of her calf and whose
calf is tied(in a stall), runs home for her calf.

Shlok 44- 45: Rama again and again saw that Kausalya, his mother who was crying thus, running
after that chariot as though dancing, shouting"Oh, Rama, Rama!" "Oh, Seetha!" and "Oh, Lakshmana!"
trickling tears descending from her eyes for the sake of Rama Lakshmana and Seetha.

Shlok 46: Dasaratha exclaimed saying "Stop!" while Rama called out "Go on, proceed!" (In that
way) Sumantra's mind became confused, as in between two (opposing) whirl pools.

Shlok 47: Rama said to him: "You can say to the king that you did not hear (his call), even
when scolded (later). seeing their grief for a long time is quite unbearbale."

Shlok 48: The charioteer, doing as per Rama's words, took leave of those citizens and drive
the horses more speedily even while they are going.

Shlok 49: The king's people returned after (mentally) going round Rama. Their minds did not
return. Their impulse of tears also did not get reduced.

Shlok 50: The ministers spoke to king Dasaratha as follows:" We should not follow to a long
distance him whom we wish to see come back."

Shlok 51: Hearing their words, which were befilting with all virtues, the king Dasaratha felt
miserable, stopped short, gazing along with his wife, at his son Rama, with his whole body
perspiring and wearing a dejected look.



Thus completes 40th chapter in the AyodhyaKanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a sage and the oldest epic.

[Text] The ladies of the royal gymnasium lament over the exile of Rama and others. The
citizens of Ayodhya also are reduced to a miserable plight. All Nature mourns at Rama's
departure.

Shlok 1: As Rama the tiger among men, having paid obeisance with joined palms departed, a
great cry of distress arose among women of inner apartments.

Shlok 2: Where is he going, who was the path, who became the protector of the people, who are
now defenseless weak and unhappy?"

Shlok 3: "Where has he gone, who was not angry even when provoked, who resolved every
misunderstanding and who propitiated all those who were angry by sharing their suffering?

Shlok 4: That illustrious and great-souled Rama, who treated us with the same reverence he
paid to his own mother, where has he gone?"

Shlok 5: "Where has he gone, he the protector of the people and the whole world, driven to
the forest by the king, goaded on by Kaikeyi? ''

Shlok 6: "Alas! In his folly, the king has banished the virtuous the beloved and the strictly
truthful Rama to the forest!"

Shlok 8: Thus did all the queens lament, like unto cows deprived of their calves and in there
affection cried out loudly.

Shlok 8: Hearing those terrible crying sounds in the private apartments, the king profoundly
afflicted by the departure of his son, became increasingly depressed.

Shlok 9: On the departure of Rama to the forest, the sacred fires were no longer performed,
no house holder prepared food, the people did not do their acts and even the sun went into
eclipse.

Shlok 10: Elephants threw out the morsels of food they had taken into their mouths. Cows did
not give suck to their calves. Mother did not rejoice, for having got a son born for the first
time.

Shlok 11: Trisanku, Lohintanga, Brihaspati as also Budha and all other planets assumed a
menacing aspect and got stayed with the moon.

Shlok 12: Stars ceased to twinkle. Planets were deprived of their splendour. The stars of
Visakha appeared in the heaven, veiled in the mist.

Shlok 13: The great ocean rose, as by a speed of a long-lasting tempest. While Rama went to
the forest, that city was shaken.

Shlok 14: All the cardinal points, having been disturbed, were covered by darkness. Planets
did not become visible, nor the stars nor any other thing in heaven.

Shlok 15: All the people of the city suddenly became apathetic. No one was interested in
either food or in pastime.

Shlok 16: All the people of Ayodhya, afflicted by grief in succession, heaved profound and
burning sighs and bewailed about the departure of the Lord of the earth.

Shlok 17: The people in the king's way were wearing distressed faces filled with tears. No one
appeared rejoicing. All were possessed by grief.

Shlok 18: The wind was not blowing coolly. The moon did not appear beneficient. The sun did
not give out warmth to the earth. The entire world was in disorder

Shlok 19: Sons did not ask for their mothers and husbands did not ask for their wives.
Brothers did not enquire about their sisters. All gave up every thing and thought of Rama
alone.

Shlok 20: Then, all of Rama's own friends were bewildered in mind and the weight of their
agony overwhelmed them. They did not leave their beds.

Shlok 21: Afflicted by fear and grief, the earth with its mountains, deprived of that great
souled Rama, suffered a terrible convulsion, as when it is abandoned by Indra the lord of rain, and
a great uproar reigned in the city which was filled with elephants, warriors and horses.

[Text] The dust raised by Rama's chariot having disappeared for a while, Dasaratha feels
dejected and fell insensible on ground. When Kaikeyi comes forward to support him he scolds and
asks her not to touch him. Kausalya then lifts him up and persuades him to return to their house.
His personal attendants take him to Kausalya's apartments and seeing him plunged in grief, Kausalya
seats herself beside him and began to lament in various ways.

Shlok 1: As long as the dust raised by the wheels of Rama's chariot could be seen, so long
did the king not withdraw his gaze from it.

Shlok 2: As long as the king was seeing his beloved son who was exceedingly virtuous, so long
did the dust in the earth appear to be rising for the purpose of seeing his son.

Shlok 3: When the dust raised by Rama's chariot was no longer visible, the unfortunate king
afflicted by dejection, fell insensible on ground.

Shlok 4: When Dasaratha fell down, Kausalya his wife took her place on his right side to lift
him up and Kaikeyi of charming limbs took her place on his left side.

Shlok 5: The king endowed with wisdom virtue and discretion seeing Kaikeyi beside him, said
to her in great agitation as follows:

Shlok 6: "Oh, wicked Kaikeyi! Do not touch my limbs. I do not wish to see you .You are no
longer my wife nor a relative."

Shlok 7: "I am not of those who are dependent on you nor are they anything to me. I discord
you, by whom righteousness has been discorded and who are solely interested in avariciousness."

Shlok 8: All that contract which I entered into by taking your hand and circumambulating the
sacred fire, I now renounce in this world and the next. "

Shlok 9: "If Bharata feels cheerful for having got this kingdom which is imperishable, let
the obsequial rites performed to me after my death do not reach me"

Shlok 10: Meanwhile Kausalya the queen overwhelmed with grief, lifted up the king who was
covered with dust and returned to her house.

Shlok 11: The virtuous monarch, thinking deeply of his son Rama, was so desolated as one who
has slain a brahmin intentionally or as touching the fire by hand.

Shlok 12: Turning again and again towards the track of the chariot, the countenance of the
king in grief lost its radiance like sun losing its radiance when swallowed by Rahu.

[Commentary] *-Rahu- the inauspicious planet sent to swallow the sun at the time of
eclipse.

Shlok 13: Afflicted by grief, thinking of his beloved son he lamented. Knowing that his son
reached the end of the city, he said as follows:

Shlok 14: "The marks of hooves of excellent horses which carried away my child are seen on the
way. But he the great souled one is not being seen"

Shlok 15-16: "He who slept on comfort on coverings sprinkled with the essence of sandalwood and
refreshed by fans waved over by him by the most deserving women, Rama the best of all my sons ,
will from now on , has to take refuge at the foot of a tree somewhere, lying down on its trunk or
rest on a stone."

Shlok 17: "The unfortunate one will wake up from the hard earth stained with dust, sighing
like a bull-elephant rising from the side of a hill"

Shlok 18: From today the inhabitants of the forest will behold that long armed lord of the
world, Rama, rising from the ground and wandering around like an orphan"

Shlok 19: "The daughter of Janaka, who was always accustomed to comforts, will wander
exhausted in the forest through the thorny undergrowth "

Shlok 20: "Sita who was not earlier accustomed to woodlands, from now on will live in terror,
hearing the roaring sound of wild beasts ,which was thundering ."

Shlok 21: "Oh, Kaikeyi! Let your desire be fulfilled! Dwell in the kingdom as a widow. I do
not indeed wish to survive without Rama the tiger among men."

Shlok 22: Thus lamenting, the king surrounded by his people, entered Ayodhya the best of
cities like entering a disastrous house by one who has taken the funeral bath.

Shlok 23: Seeing the entire city with its road-junctions and mansions deserted, its shops and
temples closed, with its people exhausted with fatigue and plunged in affliction; its highways not
very crowded ,the king entered his palace wailing and thinking of Rama alone as the sun enters a
cloud.

Shlok 24: Bereft of Rama Sita and Lakshmana, the palace looked like a big pool rendered
unperturbed due to emptying of snakes in it by Garuda*

[Commentary] *Garuda was a mythical bird (chief of feathered race, enemy of the serpent
race)

Shlok 25: The lamenting monarch spoke in trembling accents and in soft, pitiful, indistinct
and not clearly intelligible words (as follows):

Shlok 26: "Take me quickly to the apartment of Kausalya the mother of Rama. Nowhere else my
heart will find solace "

Shlok 27: The attendants took the king who was speaking as aforesaid, to Kausalya's house and
there he was gently laid (on a coach).

Shlok 28: Having entered Kausalya's apartment and even though laid on a coach, his heart
became agitated.

Shlok 29: Bereft of his two sons and his daughter -in-law also having deserted, the king saw
that house devoid of charm as a sky without a moon.

Shlok 30: Looking at that palace and lifting up his arm, the powerful monarch cried in a loud
voice, " Oh, Rama! You have left us both, your mother and I."

Shlok 31: "Alas! Those jewels among men who will survive the term of fourteen years, seeing
Rama come back and embrace him, will be happy indeed."

Shlok 32: Thereupon, the night having fallen, the night resembling the hour of death to him,
Dasaratha spoke these words to Kausalya when the midnight struck :

Shlok 33: "Oh, Kausalya! My sight has extinguished along with Rama and not returned. Even now,
I am not able to see you properly. Touch me with your hand."

Shlok 34: Perceiving that monarch on the coach absorbed in the thought of Rama alone, Kausalya
appeared very sad and sitting beside him, began to sigh and lament with a distressed look.

[Text] Lamentation of Kausalya

Shlok 1: Thereafter, Kausalya afflicted with grief of her son and seeing the king lying down
depressed with sorrow, spoke to the monarch as follows:

Shlok 2: "Having planted her poison on Rama the tiger among men, indeed Kaikeyi of crooked
ways will surely wander about freely like a female serpent that has cast off its slough"

Shlok 3: "Having fulfilled her desire of expelling Rama to the forest, Kaikeyi the charming
woman will frighten by clamping down upon me, like a dangerous serpent in the house."

Shlok 4: "Even giving my son to her as a slave would have been better. By that Rama would
have at least stayed in the house by doing the work entrusted by her and roaming about in the city,
asking alms.

Shlok 5: "Having willfully thrown Rama out of his position, Kaikeyi has acted in the same way
as one who tends the sacred fire throws a part of the sacrifice to ogres on a new or full
moon."

Shlok 6: Together with his wife, accompanied by Lakshmana and walking like king of elephants
having a bow in hand, the mighty armed hero surely will have entered the forest "

Shlok 7: " In the forest, what fate will befall them who had never seen such a suffering
before and who have been sent by you to a forest life as per the wishes of Kaikeyi?"

Shlok 8: "Devoid of riches, those youthful beings, in exile at the age when they should be
enjoying diversions of every kind, how are they to live in misery, having only roots and fruits for
their nourishment?"

Shlok 9: "When that auspicious hour will come to me that will bring an end to my sorrows and
I shall see Rama with his wife and brother returning here?"

Shlok 10: "When will Ayodhya regain her pristine glory, with people thrilling with rapture and
be adorned with rows of towering banners the moment it hears of the two heroic princes (Rama and
Lakshmana) being present ? "

Shlok 11: "When will the city rejoice like an ocean swelling jubilantly on a full moon night
to perceive the two princes who are tigers among men come back from the forest? "

Shlok 12: "When will the mighty armed hero (Rama) enter the city of Ayodhya placing Sita in
his front in the chariot as a bull would follow a cow?"

Shlok 13: "When will thousands of men shower the parched grains of paddy on the royal highway
over my two sons (Rama and Lakshmana) the subduer of their enemies, entering the city?"

Shlok 14: "When shall I see the two princes adorned with splendid ear-rings and armed with
excellent bows and swords, entering Ayodhya like a pair of mountains crowned with peaks?"

Shlok 15: "When will those two princes with Sita merrily go round the city clockwise, giving
away flowers and fruits to virgins and brahmanas?"

Shlok 16: "When will the pious Rama, grown ripe in intellect and shining like a god in point
of age ,return to me, cherishing the world like the proportious and timely rain?"

Shlok 17: "Undoubtedly in some past life, through mean-mindedness, Oh, valiant king, I believe
that the teats of cows were cut off by me while their calves were longing to suck them."

Shlok 19: "Oh, tiger among heroes! Fond of my child like a cow, I, as such was forcibly
deprived of my child by Kaikeyi in the same way as a cow having a calf of tender age may be
deprived of her calf by a lion."

Shlok 19: "I cannot indeed wish to survive without my only son who is adorned with all virtues
and is well-versed in all scriptures."

Shlok 20: "There is not the least capacity imaginable in me to sustain my life here so long as
I fail to perceive my beloved son (Rama) who is mighty armed and Lakshmana of great strength"

Shlok 21: "This fire born of grief occasioned by separation from my son, is torturing me in
the same way as the illustrious sun, possessed of greatest splendor, scorches this earth with its
rays in summer."

[Text] Establishing the greatness of Rama, Sumitra of gracious speech, assuages Kausalya's
grief.

Shlok 1: Sumitra, who was devoted to righteousness spoke the following words, which were
virtuous, to the celebrated Kausalya, the foremost among women, who had been wailing as
aforesaid



"That son of yours, oh the venerable one, is endowed with excellent virtues and is
the foremost among men. What is the use in your lamenting in this way or in weeping piteously?"

Shlok 3-4: "Oh, noble lady! Your son is having mighty strength. He proved his high- soled
father perfectly truthful by renouncing his throne. He stood firmly in righteousness, which is
always practiced perfectly by disciples and which gives fruits even after death. That Rama, the
most excellent man, never deserves to be lamented."

Shlok 5: "Lakshmana, the faultless man and the compassionate man towards all beings, always
renders the best form of service to Rama. His conduct is beneficial to the high-soled Rama."

Shlok 6: Sita, who was habituated to comforts, even after knowing the pain whatsoever, is
accompanying your virtuous- soled son."

Shlok 7: "What has not been secured by your capable son, who is rich in virtue and is
engrossed in the vow of truthfulness, and the banner of whose fame flutters though out the
world?"

Shlok 8: "Having known the purity and magnanimity of Rama , the sun assuredly will not be
able to torment Rama's body with his rays."

Shlok 9: "Auspicious and delightful breeze of moderate heat and cold, blowing from woods at
all times , will render service to Rama"

Shlok 10: "Gently touching with its cool rays when he is reposing at night and embracing him
like a father, the moon will refresh Rama"

Shlok 11-12: "Formerly, when Rama killed Subahu the son of Sambarasura the chief of demons,
Brahma being delighted , gave celestial weapons to Rama, the man with great splendor. Rama the hero
and the tiger among men, relying on the strength of his own arms, will dwell fearlessly in the
forest as if in his own palace"

Shlok 13: "How can earth cannot be under the command of Rama, to whose aim of arrows, the
enemies fall an easy prey?"

Shlok 14: "The splendor endowed with Rama, the valor that is in him and the beneficent
strength that resides in him lead one to believe that when he completes the term of his exile in
the forest, he will speedily regain his kingdom."

Shlok 15-16: "Oh, Kausalya! Rama is the illuminator of even the sun, fire of fire, the ruler of
rules, the splendor of splendor, the foremost glory of glory, the forbearance of forbearance, the
god of gods and the foremost being of all the beings. Indeed, what handicaps are there for him in
the forest or in Ayodhya?"

Shlok 17: "Rama the best among men will be installed on the throne soon along with the Mother
Earth (the consort of lord Vishnu), Sita the princess of Videha kingdom and Lakshmi ( the goddess
of fortune another consort of Vishnu)"

Shlok 18-19: "Seeing Rama departing, all the people in Ayodhya smitten as they were with upsurge
of grief shed tears born of agony. The goddess of fortune as Sita followed the invincible hero even
as he departed for the forest, clad in a garment of the sacred Kusa grass. Indeed, what can be
difficult for him to obtain?"

Shlok 20: "What can be difficult to obtain for, to whose front indeed walks Lakshmana himself
the best among the holders of bow wielding arrows, sword and missiles?"

Shlok 21: "Oh, Kausalya! I tell you the truth : you can see Rama coming back, on having
completed the term of his exile in the forest . Abandon grief and infatuation."

Shlok 22: "Oh, auspicious Kausalya, the irreproachable one! You will be able to see your son,
like the rising moon, saluting respectfully your feet, by bowing his head."

Shlok 23: "Seeing Rama shining with great splendor appearing before you again, having been
coroneted, you will be shedding soon tears of joy from your eyes "

Shlok 24: "Oh, Kausalya! Do not have uneasiness or grief. Rama has no ill luck. You will be
able to see soon your son along with Sita, accompanied by Lakshmana".

Shlok 25: "Oh, the faultless queen! While people are to be consoled by you at this moment, why
are you fostering grief in your heart?"

Shlok 26: "Oh,queen! You, whose son is Rama, ought not to grieve, for none is established in
right path in the world than Rama."

Shlok 27: "Seeing your son saluting with his friends, you will at once begin to shed tears,
like a line of clouds in a rainy season"

Shlok 28: "Your son the bestower of boons, will soon return to Ayodhya, and touch your feet
with his gentle but muscular hands "

Shlok 29: "When your son the hero along with his friends salute you respectfully in adoration,
you will sprinkle tears of joy in the same way as a line of clouds pour rain on the mountain."

Shlok 30: Sumitra the queen, skilled in her employment of words, who is faultless and
charming, thus consoled Rama's mother with various words and finally stopped speaking.

Shlok 31: Hearing those words of Sumitra the mother of Lakshmana, the agony of Kausalya Rama's
mother and the wife of Dasaratha quickly disappeared in the same way as an autumnal cloud with a
little water in it disappears quickly.



Thus completes 44th chapter in the AyodhyaKanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a sage and the oldest epic.

SARGA 45
------------------------------

[Text] Rama requests the citizens to return to Ayodhya and to show respect to Bharata the
prince Regent and Dasaratha the king. The citizens try to persuade Rama to return to Ayodhya, but
in vain. Rama along with all of them reach the bank of Tamasa.

Shlok 1: The people devoted to the high- soled Rama of unfailing bravery accompanied him on
his way to the forest for exile.

Shlok 2: When the king was forced (in the interests of his son) to turn back, the group of
friends who were following Rama's chariot did not return.

Shlok 3: Rama who enjoyed great celebrity and who was richly endowed with every virtue,
resembling the full moon, had indeed become the favorite for the people living in Ayodhya.

Shlok 4: Despite the entreaties of the people of his own, Rama(the scion of the Kakutstha),
in order to honor his father's vow; proceeded towards the forest.

Shlok 5: Fondly gazing on the people as though drinking with his eyes, Rama lovingly spoke
(as follows) as though they were his own children:

Shlok 6: "The respect and affection that has been bestowed upon me by you (the residents of
Ayodhya) may for my satisfaction be bestowed in a special measure on Bharata.

Shlok 7: "Bharata who enhances the delight of Kaikeyi and who possesses excellent conduct,
will indeed do pleasing and beneficial things to you appropriately."

Shlok 8: "Bharata who is matured in knowledge but young in age, who is gentle but endowed
with virility and virtue, will become your worthy master who can dispel your fears"

Shlok 9: "Bharata who is endowed with royal virtues is being marked as the prince. Further,
king's command is to be carried out by me and the rest of you.

Shlok 10: "If you desire to please me, see that the king does not suffer agony when I have
gone to forest for exile"

Shlok 11: The more Rama the son of Dasaratha, showed himself to be faithful to his duty, the
more the people wished to have him as their master "

Shlok 12: Rama accompanied by son of Sumitra, drew the people of the city, who were weeping
piteously, after him as if tied and pulled with cords.

Shlok 13: Those brahmanas, who were triply revered for their learning, their age and their
spirituality, their heads shaking with advanced years, cried out :

Shlok 14: "Oh Noble Steeds, of speedy breed! You who are carrying Rama, do come back! Do not
proceed! Be friendly to your master (since by taking Rama against our wishes, you will be doing a
disservice to him)"

Shlok 15: "Indeed all things, which are endowed with ears, more so horses, stand appraised of
our entreaty. Therefore, you return."

Shlok 16: "That hero of the pure soul, of virtuous and auspicious firm resolve, that master,
deserves to be brought back to the city and not to be taken to the forest."

Shlok 17: Seeing those aged brahmanas uttering those painful words, Rama quickly got down from
the chariot.

Shlok 18: Rama with Sita and Lakshmana, taking close strides, proceeded on foot towards the
forest.

Shlok 19: That Rama who was affectionate in his disposition and had compassion in his eyes,
could not abandon those brahmanas walking on foot, far behind the chariot.

Shlok 20: Perceiving Rama still going towards the forest, those brahmanas perplexed in mind
and greatly distressed, spoke the following words :

Shlok 21: "The whole of this brahmana community is following you, devoted (as you are) to the
brahmanas. See, they are bearing the sacred fires on their shoulders"

Shlok 22: "Look at these canopies (obtained by us while observing Vajpeya sacrifice*)
accompanying our backs like clouds at the end of the rainy season"

[Commentary] *-It is laid down in the Vedas that he who performs a Vajpeya sacrifice must be
supplied with a white canopy.

Shlok 23: "With these canopies of ours, we shall give shade to you, who have got no canopy and
are being scored with rays (of the sun.)"

Shlok 24: "Oh, Dear child! The intellect of ours, which was forever engaged in perusing the
study of Vedic texts has been now made to follow the course of exile to the forest"

Shlok 25: "We will carry the Vedas in our hearts as our excellent treasure and our wives too
will remain at home, protected by their character"

Shlok 26: "We shall not revoke our decision. Our mind is fully determined to go along with you
(to the forest). If you do not pay attention to piety, what being will remain devoted to the path
of virtue?"

Shlok 27: " Oh, prince of resolute conduct! We entreat you by our heads having gray hair like
the white color of the swans, that are soiled with dust as a result of their falling on the ground
(in the course of our prostration to you) (pray) turn back."

Shlok 28: "Sacrifices have been commenced by many of those Brahmanas that have come here.
Their completion, oh dear child, depends on your return"

Shlok 29: "Beings both animate and inanimate, Oh, Rama, are indeed devoted to you. Show
affection to those devotees, who entreat you to return."

Shlok 30: "The trees held by their roots, unable to accompany you, seen to be weeping,
hump-backed by the force of wind"

Shlok 31: "Birds too, which sit motionless and are unable to go out in search of food and
which remain fixed at one spot on trees, are supplicating you to return, compassionate as you are
to all created beings"

Shlok 32: While those brahmanas were crying thus with a view to persuading Rama to return, the
river Tamasa appeared there, as though retarding the progress of Rama "

Shlok 33: Thereafter Sumantra the charioteer too released the horses, tired as they were, from
the chariot and quickly making them roll, allowed them to graze not very far from the (bank of)
Tamasa once they had drunk water and had their body washed in the river."



SARGA 46
------------------------------

[Text] Having reached the banks of Tamasa river and thinking of the plight of the people of
Ayodhya, Rama passes the night on the banks of Tamasa river. Waking up in the meantime, Rama
instructs the charioteer to drive the chariot in such a way as to elude the citizens and lead them
to think that the chariot had turned back towards Ayodhya instead of proceeding towards the forest.
He then ascends the chariot along with Sita and Lakshmana and went ahead to the forest.

Shlok 1: Then Rama taking his position at the banks of Tamasa river and looking at Sita,
spoke to Lakshmana as follows :

Shlok 2: "Oh, Lakshmana! We have been sent to the forest. Today is the first night of our
residence in the forest .You ought not feel anxious. May all be well with you!"

Shlok 3: "Look here: As the animals and birds are returning to their respective abodes
seeking for shelter, the desolate woods seem to be crying from all sides"

Shlok 4: "Now, the city of Ayodhya the capital of my father with its men and women will
lament about us that have departed (to the forest). There is no doubt"

Shlok 5: "Oh, tiger among men! The citizens (of Ayodhya) are indeed having affection to the
king no less than to you and myself, as also to Bharata and Satrughna, for many of our
virtues."

Shlok 6: "I feel repented for my father and my illustrious mother. I fear whether they will
become even blind, by weeping incessantly."

Shlok 7: "Bharata, the virtuous man, can indeed console my father and mother by his kind
words."

Shlok 8: "Oh,Lakshmana! Thinking of Bharata's kindness again and again, I do not grieve for
our father and mother"

Shlok 9: "Oh, Lakshmana, tiger among men! You have done well by accompanying me, as
otherwise, a help would have to be sought for by me for protecting Seetha"

Shlok 10: " Oh, Lakshmana! I shall live on water alone tonight. Though there are various kinds
of wild fruits and roots, this is indeed a liking for me"

Shlok 11: Thus telling Lakshmana, Rama spoke also to Sumantra as follows: "Oh, gentle man!
Attend to the horses carefully."

Shlok 12: The sun having completely set, Sumantra tied up the horses, supplied them with
abundant grass and immediately stood nearest (to Rama).

Shlok 13: Having worshipped the beautiful evening twilight and having seen the night come
nearer, Sumantra along with Lakshmana made the bed for Rama.

Shlok 14: Seeing that bed made of leaves of a tree on the bank of Tamasa river with the help
of Lakshmana, Rama along with his wife laid down on it.

Shlok 15: Seeing that brother sleeping along with his wife, Lakshmana narrated Rama's various
virtues to Sumantra.

Shlok 16: WhileLakshmana was thus recounting Rama's excellences to Sumantra, keeping awake
that whole night at the bank of Tamasa river, the sun rose.

Shlok 17: At a good distance from Tamasa river, whose banks were crowded with herds of cows,
Rama passed that night there with the citizens.

Shlok 18: Getting up from the bed and seeing those citizens, Rama with an extraordinary
splendor, spoke to his brother, Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks:

Shlok 19: "Observe, Oh Lakshmana, the citizens full of longing for us, unmindful even of their
homes, sleeping together at the roots of trees, Oh, the son of Sumitra!"

Shlok 20: "From the way in which these citizens are making coercion to take us back (to
Ayodhya), it seems they will even lay down their lives, but in no case would give up their
resolve"

Shlok 21: "Till which time the citizens are asleep, within that time, let us quickly mount the
chariot and take a route which has no fear from any quarter"

Shlok 22: "From this the citizens of Ayodhya (the ancient capital of Ikshvaku), who are
longing for me, may not sleep as of now, at the roots of trees again and again"

Shlok 23: "The residents of city should indeed be made free of their suffering brought about
by (citizens) themselves, by the sons of their rulers. The citizens should on no account be
burdened with hardship caused by (princes) them selves as is our case."

Shlok 24: Lakshmana replied as follows to Rama, who is standing firm like righteousness
personified: "Oh, wise brother! What you say is agreeable to me. (Pray) ascend the chariot
quickly"

Shlok 25: Then, the glorious Rama spoke to the charioteer as follows: "Oh, capable man! Keep
the chariot ready. I shall proceed to the forest. Let us go quickly from here."

Shlok 26: Then, Sumantra quickly fastened the chariot to its excellent horses and thereafter
submitted with joined palms to Rama (as follows):

Shlok 27: "Oh, mighty armed prince! Your chariot is kept ready. You ascend it along with Sita
and with Lakshmana, Oh jewel among car-warriors! May prosperity attend you"

Shlok 28: Rama mounted the chariot with all necessaries (like bow, armor, quiver, spade,
basket, and so on) and crossed the swift flowing Tamasa river, thickly set with whirl- pools.

Shlok 29: Having duly crossed the stream, the glorious Rama the mighty armed reached a great
road free from obstacles and safe even for those who are apprehensive of danger.

Shlok 30-31: In order to elude the citizens, Rama spoke to Sumantra as follows: "Oh, charioteer!
You mount the chariot and go northward. Proceed for a while quickly and bring back the chariot
again. Remaining careful, do it in such a way that the citizens may not be able to locate me"

[Commentary] Comment:- How can Rama elude the citizens, who came off leaving their homes,
showing their immense affection towards him? Love without self-centeredness knows what love is.
Then the seemingly untruth is not untruth, the hurt in appearance is not really a hurt and the said
deception is not a deception. Rama the knower of love was free to do what was right and whatever he
did was righteous.

Shlok 32: Hearing Rama's advice, the charioteer made a round of the chariot as he was
suggested and on returning, reported to Rama about the arrival of the chariot.

Shlok 33: Then, Rama and Lakshmana(the promoters of the race of Raghu) along with Sita
ascended the chariot yoked together. The charioteer urged the horses along the route by which they
can reach a grove suited to the practice of austerities.

Shlok 34: However, Sumantra placed that chariot by facing it to the north, for he saw omens
auspicious for journey (in that quarter). Rama (son of Dasaratha) the mighty car-warrior, along
with the charioteer mounted the chariot and proceeded to the forest.



SARGA 47
------------------------------

[Text] The multitude that had caused Rama in his journey to the forest wake up to find Rama
and his associates gone. They begin to rebuke themselves. Overwhelmed with grief, they hunt up to
tracks of Rama's chariot. Being unable to find the tracks, they helplessly return to Ayodhya in
sheer despair.

Shlok 1: As the night was beginning to become dawn, those citizens relinquished by Raghava
were perplexed with grief and became motionless.

Shlok 2: Made miserable with tears born of anguish and agony, they could not notice even a
glimmer of Rama, though casting their eyes everywhere.

Shlok 3: Their faces distorted with sorrow, deprived as they were of sagacious Rama and
therefore non-pulsed, the citizens broke into piteous exclamations, saying:-

Shlok 4: "Cursed be to that slumber, rendered unconscious, by which we could not behold today
that mighty armed Rama with a broad chest."

Shlok 5: "How that Rama the strong armed, whose actions are never ineffectual, leave for
exile, abandoning his devoted citizens?"

Shlok 6: "How did the chief of Raghus, who protected us ever, like a father the children born
of his loins, could proceed to the forest, leaving us?"

Shlok 7: "Let us have recourse to death here itself, or definitely set out for a grand
journey ( to the north with a resolve to die). For what purpose can life be good for us, separated
as we are from Rama?"

Shlok 8: " Or there are a number of big dry logs of wood here. Lighting a funeral fire out of
them, let us all enter the fire."

Shlok 9: "What shall we say to our fellow citizens? ï¿½The great armed Rama who is free from
egoism and who speaks kindly ( to all ) has been conveyed to the forest by us!' How can we say
so?"

Shlok 10: "Seeing us returning without Rama, that city of Ayodhya, already desolate, will with
its women, children and the aged, become even deeply cheerless."

Shlok 11: "Having left the city thus with that hero, the conqueror of one's own self, how can
we look on that city again without him?"

Shlok 12: Uplifting their arms , those men stricken with anguish, like cows bereft of their
calves, lamented in various ways as above.

Shlok 13: Then, proceeding to some distance along the tracks for a while, they were
overwhelmed with great despair again due to sudden disappearance of tracks.

Shlok 14: The good-natured citizens, due to disappearance of the tracks of the chariot,
returned to Ayodhya, saying thus, " How is it? What shall we do? We are afflicted by
providence"

Shlok 15: Therafter, all of them with aggrieved hearts went to the city of Ayodhya, which was
comprising of virtuous people with distress, by the same path on which they had come.

Shlok 16: Beholding the city, they shed tears through their eyes stricken as they were in
grief , their minds distressed through cheerlessness.

Shlok 17: Bereft of Rama, the aforesaid city of Ayodhya was not any more enchanting than a
river whose snakes were uplifted from its pool by Garuda.

Shlok 18: As the sky without the moon or the sea without the water, these disconcerted men
beheld the city from which all joy had fled.

Shlok 19: Entering their houses full of abundant riches with uneasiness, the citizens could
not distinguish between their own people and others, even though being looked at, stricken as they
were with grief, their joy having altogether extinguished.



SARGA 48
------------------------------

[Text] Informed by the citizens of Rama's departure for the forest, when they returned to
Ayodhya after being unable to find out the tracks of his chariot, the wives of the citizens
reproach Kaikeyi and break into lamentation.

Shlok 1-2: The lives of those citizens, who had returned dejected and cheerless in this way
after accompanying Rama were greatly hurt, having their eyes filled with tears afflicted with
grief, longing to give up their lives and appeared as though they were dead.

Shlok 3: Reaching each his own house, all of them surrounded by their sons and wife, shed
tears, their faces being covered by them.

Shlok 4: None was either delightful or merry. Merchants no longer exhibited their wares, nor
their merchandise looked charming. Those in charge of home did not attend to cooking.

Shlok 5: None was delightful for instance on finding out a lost fortune, or on getting riches
in abundance. No mother did rejoice even on obtaining a son born for the first time.

Shlok 6: Oppressed with sorrow and weeping, women in every house heaped reproaches on their
husbands who came home, with words as sharp as pricks of the goad which attack an elephant.

Shlok 7: "What purpose of theirs who do not see Rama, will be served by their dwellings, wife
or wealth or sons or pleasures even?"

Shlok 8: Lakshmana alone is a good man in this world, who was accompanying Rama belonging to
Kakutstha dynasty, along with Sita ,duly rendering service to them in the forest."

Shlok 9: "Fortunate too are the rivers; lotus ponds and lakes for bathing in whose sacred
waters Rama entered into."

Shlok 10: "Forests with beautiful row of trees, tracks of land abounding in water, rivers and
mountains with alluring peaks will bring splendor to Rama."

Shlok 11: "Any mountain or forest which Rama will visit, will not fail to respect him like a
beloved guest who has arrived."

Shlok 12: "Plants with many -colored flowers as their chaplets, bearing copious clusters of
blossoms full of bees exhibit themselves at Rama."

Shlok 13: "Even in unseasonable ness, mountains in compassion will present principal flowers
and fruits to Rama, on his arrival."

Shlok 14: "Mountains will show various wonderful waterfalls again and again, duly streaming
forth uncontaminated waters."

Shlok 15: "Trees on apex of mountains will enrapture Rama. Where there is Rama, there is
neither fear nor humiliation".

Shlok 16: "That Rama the son of Dasaratha, the hero and the mighty armed will come to our view
not far from us. Let us run after him."

Shlok 17: "The shelter of the feet of the lord and the high-souled Rama is in itself a joy.
Rama indeed is the protector of all of us, he the refuge and our supreme asylum "

Shlok 18: "We shall serve Sita; while you attend on Rama." Thus, the citizen's wives,
afflicted with agony, spoke in so many words to their husbands.

Shlok 19: "Rama will secure the needs and interests of yours in the forest, while Sita will do
the same thing with regard to us womenfolk."

Shlok 20: "Who will be highly pleased with this residence in the city, which is apprehensible,
with anxious people in it and not being a pleasant spot with unsettled minds?"

Shlok 21: "If it were to be the rule of Kaikeyi, it will not be in consonance with
righteousness, with no protector and indeed with no use for our lives, mush less for our sons and
riches."

Shlok 22: "Whom else Kaikeyi will not abandon? --that Kaikeyi, by whom her son and her husband
were forsaken for the sake of power and who brought disgrace to her family."

Shlok 23: "We swear even by our sons that while Kaikeyi is surviving and as long as we live,
we will never inhabit this kingdom as Kaikeyi's servants!"

Shlok 24: "Who can live happily on having obtained (as one's ruler) that impious woman of
wicked conduct, who banished the son of the king without any pity?"

Shlok 25: "The whole of this kingdom, without any leader, having no support and visited by
calamities, will meet with ruin because of Kaikeyi's fault."

Shlok 26: "For, Rama having gone into exile, the monarch will not survive and when Dasaratha
is dead, utter regrets will remain thereafter. It is certain!"

Shlok 27: "So, drink poison duly stirred up, since your merits are exhausted and you are
marked out by ill fortune. Otherwise, follow Rama to forest or reach a place where even the name of
Kaikeyi may not reach your ears."

Shlok 28: "Rama has been sent to exile along with Sita and Lakshmana deceitfully. We have been
handed over now to Bharata, like the beasts in the hands of a slaughterer."

Shlok 29-30-31: "Rama, whose face is like the full moon, of dark brown complexion, whose collar-bone
is invisible (because of its being covered with flesh), a conqueror of foes, whose arms descend to
his knees, whose eyes resemble lotuses, the elder brother of Lakshmana, who takes initiative in
speaking and expresses with sweetness, truthful of speech and possessed of extra ordinary strength,
is benevolent to all, delightfully charming as the moon, that tiger among men, as mighty as an
elephant in rut, that great car-warrior, will surely adorn the woods, while roaming through
them.."

Shlok 32: Those wives of citizens in the city of Ayodhya, lamenting as aforesaid, began
weeping, as though fear has cropped up for a forth-coming death.

Shlok 33: The sun sank below the horizon and the night fell, while the women in the houses
were weeping in that manner about Rama.

Shlok 34: The city of Ayodhya, in which the kindling of fires had ceased and the chanting of
Vedas and narration of sacred stories died out, looked as though it was coated with darkness at
that time.

Shlok 35: The city of Ayodhya, in which the business of the trading class had come to a
stand-still, in which joy had been faded out, which had become (now) support less, looked dim as
though stars had disappeared in the sky.

Shlok 36: The women whose minds became sick on account of Rama, as one would feel on one's own
son or brother having been sent into exile, cried miserably expressing their grief in various ways.
To them, Rama was dearer than their very sons!

Shlok 37: That city of Ayodhya, in which singing, rejoicing, dancing and instrumental music
had been completely set at rest, when jpy had departed forever and whose shops had been closed,
looked at that time like a grat ocean whose waters had dried up.



SARGA 49
------------------------------

[Text] Having traveled for a pretty long distance, Rama crossed Vedasruti, Gomati and
Syandika rivers. He presses forward in the chariot talking with Sumantra.

Shlok 1: Rama the tiger among men, revolving in his mind the command of his father, covered a
long distance during the rest of the night.

Shlok 2: While Rama was traveling with the same alacrity, that delightful night passed away.
Having worshipped the blissful morning twilight, he passed beyond the boundary of that country.

Shlok 3: Seeing villages, whose outskirts have been tilled and the woodlands laden with
blossoms and hearing as follows the words of men dwelling together in the midst of the village,
Rama proceeded apace in those excellent horses as though slowly (engrossed as he was in enjoying
the sights).

Shlok 4-5-6: "Woe unto the king Dasaratha who fell into the clutches of concupiscence. Alas!
Kaikeyi the cruel and the sinful one now is still engaged in a cruel game. She is sending to exile
the prince Rama, the pious man, the great intellectual, the compassionate man and he who subdued
the senses. That hot-tempered Kaikeyi is behaving in a rude manner, transgressing the bounds of
propriety"

Shlok 7: "How Sita the venerable woman, the daughter of Janaka, who was delighted always in
homely comforts can now experience hardships in the forest?"

Shlok 8: "What a surprise! The king Dasaratha, having no love for his son, now wants to
abandon Rama who is so beloved to the people and is even faultless."

Shlok 9: Hearing these words of people residing in villages and hamlets, Rama the heroic
prince of Kosala crossed the boundaries of Kosala state.

Shlok 10: Having crossed the river of auspicious waters called Vedashruti, Rama then stretched
forth, facing the quarter occupied by Sage Agastya.

Shlok 11: After traveling a pretty long time from there, Rama crossed the river Gomati having
beautiful waters, whose banks were adorned with cows and which headed towards the sea.

Shlok 12: Reaching the other bank of Gomati river with the help of the swift moving horses,
Rama crossed the river called Syandika which had resounded with howls of peacocks and swans.

Shlok 13: The said Rama showed to Sita the land (of Kosala, the southern boundary of which was
defined by Syandika river)given long ago by the king Manu to Ikshvaku and which was bounded by many
territories.

Shlok 14: The glorious Rama, the foremost among men, whose voice resembled the cackling of a
swan in rut, addressed the charioteer with great affection, in the words "Oh, charioteer!" and
spoke as follows :

Shlok 15: "When, coming back and united with my mother and father, shall I roam hunting in the
forest, bordering on Sarayu river and laden with blossoms?"

Shlok 16-17: "I do not hanker much after hunting in the woodlands bordering on Sarayu river. In
fact it is a delightful spot, made much of in the world by hosts of royal sages. Hunting in the
forest is indeed for gratification of royal sages in this world. At times; the bow- men adopted it.
But I do not long for it excessively."

Shlok 18: Uttering in sweet voice to the charioteer on various topics dearer to him, Rama
advanced thus along that route.



SARGA 50
------------------------------

[Text] Rama bids farewell to his birth-place Ayodhya and reaches the bank of the holy
Ganga. There, Nishadas offers welcome reception to Rama and others.

Shlok 1: Having traveled the extensive and beautiful Kosala territory and standing with his
face turned towards Ayodhya, the wise Rama with joined palms spoke the following words:

Shlok 2: "I bid farewell to you, Oh best of the cities, carefully protected by Dasaratha born
in Kakutstha dynasty, as well as of the deities who protect you and dwell in you."

Shlok 3: "After getting relieved from exile in the forest and thus freed from the debt to the
emperor, I shall see you again, duly getting united with my mother and father."

Shlok 4: Lifting his right arm and wearing a woeful look, his face covered with tears, Rama
possessing lovely reddish eyes, spoke them to the people hailing from the countryside.(as follows)
:

Shlok 5: "Mercy and compassion according to my worth (in your view) have been shown to me by
you. Keeping agony for a long time is undesirable. Let each return to accomplish your desired
object(attending to your house-hold work)!"

Shlok 6: Respectfully saluting the high soled prince and going round him clockwise (as a mark
of reverence), those men stood rooted here and there, wailing frightfully.

Shlok 7: While they were lamenting thus unceasingly, Rama passed beyond their sight, as the
sun sinks out of view at nightfall.

Shlok 8-9-10: Then Rama, a tiger among men, in his chariot, crossed Kosala territory, which was
rich in grain and treasure, inhabited by men given to charity, benevolent and free from every
danger, pleasing, full of temples and sacrificial stakes, adorned with gardens and mango-orchards,
intersected by ponds full of water, populated by contented and well nourished people, abounded in
herds of cows which deserved to be seen by all kings and which re-echoed to the chanting of
religious texts.

Shlok 11: Rama, the best among the resolute, moved into the middle of a happy and prosperous
kingdom, abounding in lovely gardens and fit to be enjoyed by kings.

Shlok 12: There, Rama beheld the celestial and lovely river of Ganga with its tree
tributaries, carrying clear waters without green moss and frequented by sages.

Shlok 13: The River Ganga was adorned with splendid hermitages within easy distance from one
another, with pools overflowing with water, visited at suitable hours by celestial nymphs thrilling
with rapture.

Shlok 14: The blessed river was graced by gods and demons, Gandharvas(celestial musicians) and
kinnaras and was constantly visited by consorts of Nagas and Gandharvas.

Shlok 15: The well known river was hemmed in by hills serving as the play- ground of hundreds
of celestials and embellished with hundreds of celestial gardens; it coursed through the heavens
for the benefit of gods and which in heaven was named "The stream of Golden Lotuses".

Shlok 16: The holy river, the sound of whose clashing waves and its striking with rocks
resembled a deep laughter, having a bright smile as white as a foam, its waters reduced at some
places to the shape of a maiden's plaited locks, was rendered beautiful at some places by whirl
pools.

Shlok 17: At some places, its waters were still and deep. At some places, they were disturbed
with violent agitation. At some places, they made a deep roaring sound. At some places, they were
having a terrific noise

Shlok 18: Hosts of gods took a dip into its water .It was adorned by white lotuses. It was
hemmed in, with expanse of small islands and at some places, lined with white sands.

Shlok 19: The river was rendered resonant by swans and cranes, was graced with cackling of
Chakrawaka** birds and other birds which are in rut all through the year kept hovering on its
water.

Shlok 20: At some places the river was adorned with trees growing on its banks encircling like
garlands, at some places crowded with thick cluster of lotuses.

Shlok 21: At some places, it was graced with beds of water lilies in the form of buds and at
some places, it was reddened with the pollen of numerous flowers, as though excited with
passion.

Shlok 22: Having every aggregation of dirt removed, the river presented a spotlessly clear
appearance like a crystal. The interior of the forest was reddened noisy again and again by the
elephants guarding the quarters, by the ruttiest wild elephants and the elephants of excellent
breed used for riding by gods.

Shlok 23-24: Surrounded by fruits and flowers and tender leaves, shrubs and birds, it looked like
a young woman artistically decked with the best of jewels. The river was infested with dolphins,
crocodiles and snakes.

Shlok 25-26: Rama, the mighty armed, reached the river Ganga, which is devoid of sins and which
dispels all sins, which had fallen from the mass of matted hair of Lord Shankara through the
spiritual power of Emperor Bhagiratha, which is rendered noisy by cranes and herons, which is a
consort of the ocean and which is in the vicinity of Sringaverapura(the modern Singraur).

Shlok 27: Beholding the river Ganga with its waves covering whirlpools, Rama the great warrior
said to Sumantra the charioteer as follows: "We shall halt here itself today."

Shlok 28: "Oh, charioteer! Not far from the river stands this very large sacred fig tree with
its many flowers and shoots. We shall stay here itself."

Shlok 29: "I shall see (from here) the excellent river Ganga, which is auspicious and whose
waters deserve to be respected by gods, men, Gandharvas, beasts, reptiles and birds ."

Shlok 30: Saying ï¿½so be it' and nothing more to Rama, Lakshmana and Sumantra too then directed
the horses to that sacred fig tree.

Shlok 31: Rama, the delight of Ikshvaku dynasty, reached that beautiful tree and got down from
the chariot along with Sita and Lakshmana.

Shlok 32: Sumantra too dismounted from the chariot, unyoked the superb horses after which with
joined palms, he seated himself near Rama at the foot of the tree.

Shlok 33: There, a king named Guha was Rama's friend dear to him as his own life. He was
Nishada by birth, a strong man and well known as a ruler of Nishadas.

Shlok 34: Hearing of Rama the tiger among men having come to his territory, he approached the
prince, escorted by elderly ministers and relatives.

Shlok 35: Seeing from a distance the king of Nishada coming, Rama along with Lakshmana
thereupon went forth to meet Guha.

Shlok 36: Closely embracing Rama, Guha who felt disturbed, spoke to him, "This city too is as
much as Ayodhya to you. What can I do for you? Oh mighty armed! Who indeed will get such a lovely
guest?"

Shlok 37: Having brought pristine cooked rice of excellent quality and other dishes of various
kinds, he then quickly offered him water to wash his hands and spoke as follows:

Shlok 38: "Welcome to you, Oh, mighty armed! All this land is yours. We are your servants. You
are the Lord. Rule over our kingdom in an efficient way."

Shlok 39: "Here have arrived various kinds of dishes, drinks and syrups as also excellent beds
(for you to sleep on) and food for your horses"

Shlok 40-41: To Guha who was speaking as aforesaid, Rama replied thus: "We stand honored by you,
by your very visit to us on foot, as well as your show of affection and are pleased with you"

Shlok 42-43: Pressing gently with his muscular arms, Rama spoke these words: " Oh, Guha! Thank
heaven that I am seeing you in good health with your relatives. Is all well with the kingdom, the
allies and the treasure?"

Shlok 43: "I know your affection by which all this is extensively well arranged by you. But I
am not in a position indeed to accept it."

Shlok 44: "Know me as under a vow to be an ascetic, wearing the robes of bark and deerskin and
by piety, I am determined to live in the forest by eating roots and fruits only."

Shlok 45: "I desire nothing but a little forage for the horses. By being provided with this
much at the present moment, I shall be duly satisfied by you."

Shlok 46: "These horses were cherished by the king Dasaratha, my father. I shall feel honored
by these horses being duly fed."

Shlok 47: Then Guha on that spot commanded his men as follows: "Let water for drinking and
forage be supplied promptly to horses"

Shlok 48: Having worshipped the evening twilight appearing in the west, with an upper garment
made of bark(on his person); Rama then took for food only water brought by Lakshmana himself.

Shlok 49: Having washed the feet of Rama who was lying on the ground along with his consort,
Lakshmana then came and stood near a tree.

Shlok 50: Guha too along with the charioteer conversed with Lakshmana and thereafter wielding
a bow; alertly kept a vigil over Rama.

Shlok 51: The illustrious, lofty minded and the high-soled son of Dasaratha, who had never
seen suffering and who deserved all comforts, remained lying on the ground thereafter, while that
long night passed away.



SARGA 51
------------------------------

[Text] Guha requests Lakshmana to take rest, duly expressing his readiness to guard Rama
and his consort by keeping awake the whole night. Lakshmana expressed his unwillingness to lie down
in the presence of his elder brother and sister in law and preferred to remain awake. He spends
night talking with Guha, voicing grief for his royal father as well as his affectionate
mothers.

Shlok 1: Distressed with anguish (to see Rama and Sita lying on the ground) Guha said to
Lakshmana, the scion of Raghu, who kept awake, through sincere love, for the protection of his
brother Rama.

Shlok 2: "Here is a comfortable bed made for you, my friend! Relax well comfortably on it,
Oh, prince!"

Shlok 3: "All of us are habituated to hardships. You are habituated to comforts. We shall
keep awake this night, for the protection of Rama"

Shlok 4: "For, none is dearer to me than Rama in this world. I speak the truth and swear to
you by truth."

Shlok 5: "I hope to acquire abundant acclaim and supreme merit in this world as also full
reward of wealth, by the sole grace of Rama"

Shlok 6: "As such, I along with my kindred, shall protect my dear friend Rama who is reposing
with Sita in every way, with bow in hand."

Shlok 7: "Nothing is indeed unknown in this forest to me, where I wander continually. We can
able to withstand even a vast army too, comprising of four parts (elephants, chariots, cavalry, and
infantry)."

Shlok 8: Then, Lakshmana replied to Guha as follows: "Oh, sinless Guha! Being protected by
you, who keep your duty alone in view, all of us are fearless in this land."

Shlok 9: "When Rama, the son of Dasaratha is lying on the ground with Sita, how is it
possible for me to sleep or to enjoy the pleasures of life?"

Shlok 10: "See that Rama, who cannot be vanquished in combat even by the gods and demons
combined, now sleeping profoundly on the grass along with Sita."

Shlok 11-12: When Rama- who is endowed with similar characteristics as Dasaratha, uniquely
beloved, the son obtained by Dasaratha by virtue of his chanting of several sacred texts and
austerities and by various undertakings (in the form of sacrificial performances) has gone to
exile, the king will not live long and the earth will become surely widowed forthwith.

Shlok 13: Having cried out in a high-pitched tone, the women having exhausted, will have
fallen silent and I am sure that a profound stillness reigns in the palace.

Shlok 14: "I do not expect Kausalya, Dasaratha and my mother all of them to remain alive for
this night."

Shlok 15: "By looking forward to meet Satrughna, my mother might even stay alive. But it will
be painful if Kausalya who has given birth to a heroic son, dies."

Shlok 16: That city of Ayodhya, filled with devoted people, hitherto a source of joy and which
brought pleasure to the world, when seized with agony over the king's death, will perish.

Shlok 17: "How, in the absence of his magnanimous and the first born son, will the vital airs
in the body of the generous king be maintained?"

Shlok 18: "After the death of king, Kausalya will die. My mother also will die thereafter.

Shlok 19: "Having failed to install Rama in the kingdom, failed forever, which was the most
cherished wish of his heart, my father will leave this world.

Shlok 20: "Those who are fortunate will consecrate our deceased father and the king in the
course of all funeral rites, when the hour has struck.

Shlok 21-22-23: People will joyfully move in the capital belonging to my father and the city with
its quadrangular places allocated at lovely sites, and well- aligned roads, rich in mansions of
well-to-do men, temples and royal palaces adorned with the foremost of courtesans, its chariots
horses and elephants that obstruct the roads, the musical instruments that resound there- full of
all blessings and crowded with merry and well fed men, well- provided with gardens and royal parks
and bright with festivities carried on under the patronage of associations.

Shlok 24: Will Dasaratha remain alive? After returning from exile, can we see the high-soled
king Dasaratha of noble vows again?

Shlok 25: Can we safely return to Ayodhya, after completion of the exile in the forest along
with Rama who is faithful to his promises?

Shlok 26: While the high-soled Lakshmana thus lamenting, stood on ground, afflicted with
anguish as he was, that night rolled away.

Shlok 27: While Lakshmana (son of Dasaratha), who was concerned with the welfare of the
people; was thus speaking the truth out of his affection for his elder brother (Rama), Guha,
overcome with agony and oppressed with adversity shed tears like an elephant tormented with
fever.



SARGA 52
------------------------------

[Text] As per instructions of Rama, Guha gets a boat ready. Sumantra requests Rama to take
him as a personal attendant to the forest, but Rama declines his offer and after reasoning with
him, sends him back to Ayodhya. Rama and Lakshmana matted their hair with the latex of a banyan
tree procured by Guha. On reaching the middle of the stream, Sita offers prayers to Mother Ganga
(the deity presiding over the stream) and after crossing the river, all the three halt for the
night at the foot of a tree.

[Text] 

Shlok 1: That night having given way to dawn, the illustrious Rama with a broad chest spoke
(as follows) to Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra and who was endowed with auspicious signs :

Shlok 2: "Oh, dear brother! This is the hour of sunrise. The auspicious night has departed.
That bird of dark plumage, the cuckoo, is singing."

Shlok 3: "Oh, good brother! Hear the cries of peacocks resounding in the forest. Let us cross
the swift-flowing Ganga River that gushes to the sea."

[Commentary] --***-The river Ganga, when brought down from heaven by the austerities of
Emperor Bhagiratha, followed the latter to the subterranean regions in order to consecrate the
remains of his great grand uncles. In its course, it inundated the sacrificial ground of king
Jahnu, who in his anger, drank up its waters. But the gods and sages and particularly Bhagiratha
appeased his anger and he consented to release the waters through his ears. The river is thereafter
regarded as his daughter.

Shlok 4: Lakshmana, the delight of his friends, having understood the words of Rama, called
Guha as well as Sumantra and stood in front of his brother.

Shlok 5: Hearing the command of Rama, Guha quickly received it, invited his ministers and
spoke to them as follows:

Shlok 6: "Let a beautiful boat that is solidly constructed, sails well and a helmsman in it,
be brought to the bank to carry this hero across!"

Shlok 7: Hearing that command, the chief minister of King Guha brought a charming boat to the
bank and reported the matter to Guha.

Shlok 8: Then, Guha with folded hands spoke to Rama as follows: "Oh, Lord! Here, the boat has
arrived. What more can I do for you?"

Shlok 9: "Oh, tiger among men! Oh, Rama resembling a son of divinity! Here is the boat for
you to cross the river, which flows into the sea. Oh, virtuous one! (Pray) get into it."

Shlok 10: Then, Rama with great splendor, spoke to Guha as follows: "My desire has been
accomplished by you. Let us embark with all speed."

Shlok 11: Having equipped themselves with a quiver each with arrows, fastening their swords
and armed with their bows, Rama and Lakshmana, with Sita, proceeded towards the river of Ganga.

Shlok 12: Sumantra joining his palms in humility, approached Rama who knew what is right and
said, "What shall I do?"

Shlok 13: Touching Sumantra with his auspicious right hand, Rama then said: "Oh, Sumantra!
Return quickly to the king's presence and be attentive in serving him."

Shlok 14: "Go now, that your service to me has been completed. Abandoning the chariot, I shall
go on foot to the mighty forest," Rama said.

Shlok 15: Finding himself dismissed, Sumantra the charioteer was distressed and spoke to Rama,
the tiger among men, as follows:

Shlok 16: "None in the world has had to suffer such a fate as yourself; that you should have
to dwell in the forest with your brother and your consort as if you were an ordinary man!"

Shlok 17: "I think that there is no reward in leading a life of religious student or in
studying religious scriptures or even in cultivating tenderness and straight forwardness, when
adversity has come to you."

Shlok 18: "Oh, heroic Rama! Living in the forest along with Sita and your brother, you will
obtain the same position as one who has conquered the three worlds."

Shlok 19: "Oh, Rama! We are actually ruined, in that, disappointed in our hopes by you too, we
shall fall under the sway of Kaikeyi the sinful woman and reap the suffering."

Shlok 20: Sumantra the charioteer thus speaking, wept for a long time, stricken with grief,
seeing Rama, equal to his soul, departing to a distance.

Shlok 21: Then, Rama again and again spoke these sweet words as follows to that charioteer,
whose tears got dried up and who had sipped some water and got himself purified:

Shlok 22: "I do not see any one who is as great a friend of the Ikshvakus as you are. (Pray)
act in such a way that king Dasaratha may not lament about me"

Shlok 23: "The king, his mind afflicted with grief, is aged as well. He is pressed down by a
burden of passion. Hence, I tell you this."

Shlok 24: "What so ever act that high-soled emperor may enjoin you to do, with intent to
oblige the desire of Kaikeyi, it is to be done unhesitatingly."

Shlok 25: "The kings indeed rule the states with this end in view that their will may not be
frustrated in any undertaking."

Shlok 26: "Oh, Sumantra! Carry out everything in such a way that the said emperor neither
finds it unpleasing nor gets tormented by grief."

Shlok 27: "Only after performing respectful salutation to the old and venerable king, who has
never known suffering and who has subdued his senses, you tell these words to him on my
behalf."

Shlok 28: "Indeed neither I nor Lakshmana and Sita grieve for having moved from Ayodhya or
that we are going to dwell in a forest."

Shlok 29: "After completing fourteen years, you will once more see Lakshmana, myself and Sita
too returned apace from the forest."

Shlok 30-31: "Oh,Sumantra! This is what you should say to the king, my mother, all other queens
and Kaikeyi. Tell Kausalya again and again that I am keeping good health. Thereafter, convey
salutations at her feet on behalf of Sita as well as myself and Lakshmana the faithful man."

Shlok 32: "Tell our salutations to the emperor too. Bring Bharata quickly. After his arrival,
Bharata may be installed in the position, as desired by the king."

Shlok 33: "When you embrace Bharata and install him in the office of the Prince Regent, the
agony caused by the repentance felt by you on our account will not overpower you."

Shlok 34: "Bharata too is to be told thus: "Treat without distinction all your mothers with
the same regard as you behave towards the king."

Shlok 35: "As is your affection for Kaikeyi, so let it be for Sumitra and also the divine
Kausalya, my mother"

Shlok 36: "If you accept the princely kingdom with an intent to please our father, it will be
possible for you to enhance happiness in both the worlds (in this world and the next)."

Shlok 37: Sumantra, who was being sent back by Rama, was agonized with grief after hearing the
whole of that discourse and affectionately spoke to Rama as follows:

Shlok 38: "If I spoke to you fearlessly in a friendly tone without following courteousness,
you ought to forgive my mode of expression, considering me as your devotee"

Shlok 39: "How indeed can I return without you to that city, which through separation from
you, has been reduced to the state of a mother stricken with grief due to separation from her
son"

Shlok 40: "By seeing my chariot on that day even with Rama in it, the people were lamenting so
much. Now, if they see the chariot without Rama the city of Ayodhya will even be broken
asunder."

Shlok 41: "The city will be plunged in misery, like an army in which its commander is lost in
a combat with the charioteer alone surviving, on seeing this chariot without you."

Shlok 42: "Thinking of you, who though residing far away are established foremost in their
minds, the people of Ayodhya must have been deprived of their food today."

Shlok 43: "The great perplexity that ensued, on the occasion of your exile, among the people
(of Ayodhya), whose minds were depressed through grief on your account, was witnessed by you
indeed, Oh, Rama!"

Shlok 44: "The cry of distress raised by the citizens (of Ayodhya) will be increased a
hundred-fold, when they see me with an empty chariot."

Shlok 45: "Further, shall I say to the queen Kausalya as follows: - ï¿½Your son, Rama has been
taken by me to the house of his maternal uncle, do not grieve'."

Shlok 46: "I cannot tell such words too which are untrue. How can I tell, ï¿½I abandoned your
son in the forest', which words are true but unkind?"

Shlok 47: "How will the excellent horses obedient to me, which carried yourself, Sita and
Lakshmana, draw the chariot bereft of you?"

Shlok 48: "Oh, the faultless Rama! For this reason, I cannot go back to Ayodhya. (Pray) permit
me to accompany you to the forest."

Shlok 49: "If you leave me even though I solicit you to take me with you, I shall enter a fire
with chariot and all, here itself the moment I am forsaken by you"

Shlok 50: "Oh, Rama! With the help of the chariot, I shall ward off those animals in the
forest, which create obstacles to your austerities."

Shlok 51: "The pleasure of driving your chariot has been obtained by me because of you and it
is through you that I seek the happiness that comes in dwelling in a forest."

Shlok 52: "Be graceful. I desire to become your close associate in the forest. I wish to hear
your loving assent with the words ï¿½be my close associate!"

Shlok 53: "Oh, hero! If these horses too can render service to you, they can attain a supreme
abode."

Shlok 54: -"By all means, I am leaving for good, Ayodhya or even heaven. Dwelling in the
forest, with my head bent low, I shall render service to you."

Shlok 55: "As a doer of wicked deeds cannot enter Amaravati, the capital of Devendra, so also
I cannot enter Ayodhya without you."

Shlok 56: "This is indeed my desire that after reaching the end of your exile, I may take you
back to the city of Ayodhya in this very chariot."

Shlok 57: "So long as I am with you together in the forest, fourteen years will slip away
momentarily. Otherwise than this, they will multiply a hundred- fold."

Shlok 58: "Oh, prince, who are so fond of your dependents! You ought not abandon me, your
devoted servant, established in the path followed by the son of his master and (always)keeping
within bounds."

Shlok 59: Rama, who was compassionate towards his dependents, spoke as follows to Sumantra,
who was miserably entreating him again and again in many modes.

Shlok 60: "Oh, charioteer so fond of your master! I know your excellent devotion to me. Hear
wherefore I send you from here to the city of Ayodhya."

Shlok 61: "Seeing you, returning to Ayodhya, Kaikeyi, my younger mother will get the proof
that Rama has gone to the forest."

Shlok 62: "Having completely satisfied, about me having gone to forest, Kaikeyi will leave her
strong suspicion that the virtuous king may be a person who speaks untruth."

Shlok 63: "This is my first priority that my younger mother should get the extensive kingdom,
protected by Bharata and thus ruled by her own son."

Shlok 64: "For my pleasure and pleasure of the king, you go along with the chariot to Ayodhya
and inform all the matters that you have been asked to tell each in the way you have been asked to
do."

Shlok 65: Having spoken thus to the charioteer, the courageous Rama consoled him again and
again. Then, he spoke the following reasoned words to Guha:

Shlok 66: "Oh, Guha! This stay in the inhabited woods is not proper for me. My stay should
definitely be in a hermitage. Let an action diverted towards that aim be taken"

Shlok 67: "I as such, wishing well of my father, Sita as well as Lakshmana and having taken up
a discipline to be followed by ascetics, want to proceed further, wearing matted hair. Please bring
the latex of a banyan tree."

Shlok 68: Guha immediately brought that latex to the prince. With that, Rama made matted hair
to himself and to Lakshmana.

Shlok 69-70: Rama, tiger among men who possessed long arms wore the distinguished mark of an
ascetic (in the shape of matted hair) . Then, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers clad in the bark of
trees and wearing a round mass of matted locks (on their head) looked bright like two ascetic
sages.

Shlok 71: Having adopted the way of a hermit (temporarily) along with Lakshmana, Rama then
accepted the vow of an ascetic life and spoke to Guha, his friend as follows:

Shlok 72: "Oh, Guha! Remain vigilant in defense, finance, internal security and public
relations, for a kingdom is the most difficult one to be protected!"

Shlok 73: Then Rama, who was a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty, bade farewell to Guha and departed
quickly, remaining undistracted, along with his consort and together with Lakshmana.

Shlok 74: Seeing the boat on the bank of the river and keen to cross the swift- flowing Ganga,
Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: -

Shlok 75: "Oh, Lakshmana the tiger among men! You get into the boat stationed here unhurriedly
afterwards, having helped Sita the virtuous wife step into it."

Shlok 76: Hearing the command completely of his elder brother, the prudent Lakshmana, by not
counteracting it, made Sita to ascend the boat first and stepped into it afterwards.

Shlok 77: Then, the glorious Rama got into the boat himself. Thereafter, Guha the ruler of
Nishadas commanded his kinsfolk to row them across the river.

Shlok 78: After ascending the boat, Rama too of mighty splendor then recited a sacred text
(daiviim naavam etc) fit for brahmanas and Kshatriyas alike and conducive to his own good.

Shlok 79: Having sipped water as per scriptures and with extreme delight, Rama with Sita made
obeisance to that river. Lakshmana, of infinite splendor, followed suit.

Shlok 80: Bidding farewell to Guha with his army of men and Sumantra, Rama sat on the boat and
directed the boatmen to move on.

Shlok 81: Propelled by those splendid and vigorous oarsmen, that boat furnished with a pilot,
rapidly moved across the water.

Shlok 82: Coming to the middle of Bhagirathi river, the irreproachable Sita with joined palms,
spoke as follows to the said river: -

Shlok 83-84-85: "Oh, Ganga! Let Rama, the son of the emperor Dasaratha honor his father's command
under your protection! Having dwelled in the forest in full fourteen years, may he return once more
to your bank with his brother, Lakshmana and myself! Oh, blessed goddess Ganga! Returning safely,
with all my desires fulfilled, I shall worship you with great joy."

Shlok 86: You, Oh goddess flowing through three regions (namely heaven, earth and subterranean
regions), include in your basin the realm of Brahma (the outermost of the six spheres enveloping
the earth) and are vividly seen on this terrestrial plane as a consort of the ocean king."

Shlok 87-88: "Oh, charming goddess! I, Sita, greet you and extol you too. When Rama the tiger
among men safely returns and regains his kingdom, I shall give away a lakh of cows, soft clothing
and food to brahmanas with intent to please you."

Shlok 89: "Oh, goddess! After reaching back the city of Ayodhya, I shall worship you with
thousand pots of spirituous liquor and jellied meat with cooked rice well prepared for the solemn
rite."

Shlok 90: "I shall worship all deities dwelling on your banks as also sacred spots and
sanctuaries."

Shlok 91: "Oh, irreproachable goddess! May the sinless Rama (with mighty arms) re-enter
Ayodhya again from the forest, along with Lakshmana and myself."

Shlok 92: Thus praying to Ganga, the efficient and irreproachable Sita rapidly reached the
right bank of the river.

Shlok 93: Reaching the bank and leaving the boat, Rama the best among men and the chastiser of
foes proceeded further along with Lakshmana and Sita.

Shlok 94: Then, Rama the mighty armed, spoke to Lakshmana (who heightened the joy of Sumitra)
as follows:

Shlok 95: "Security is an inevitable need in a forest, which has unforeseen dangers and is
uninhabited, Oh, Lakshmana! Go in front. Let Sita follow you."

Shlok 96: "I shall proceed in the rear, protecting you and Sita. Oh, jewel among men! We must
accord protection here to one another."

Shlok 97: "An act which has gone out of hand, whatsoever, cannot indeed be remedied again.
Sita will experience the hardship of staying in a forest only from now."

Shlok 98: "Today she will enter the forest, where density of people is not seen, which is
utterly devoid of fields and gardens, has a rugged surface and is full of stumbles."

Shlok 99: Listening to Rama's words, Lakshmana walked in front. Immediately after Sita, Rama,
the delight of Raghu dynasty, advanced.

Shlok 100: Constantly gazing at Rama, who reached soon the other bank of Ganga River, the
distressed Sumantra, his vision having failed due to the long distance and perturbed as he was,
shed tears (of grief over separation from Rama).

Shlok 101: Having crossed the great river, Rama the high-soled, the bestowal of boons, equal in
glory with the guardians of spheres, then reached progressively the prosperous and the happy land
of Vatsa; which contained rows of beautiful crops.

Shlok 102: Having hunted there four deer, namely Varaaha, Rishya, Prisata; and Mahaaruru (the
four principal species of deer) and taking quickly the portions that were pure, being hungry as
they were, Rama and Lakshmana reached a tree to take rest in the evening.



SARGA 53
------------------------------

[Text] Rama tries to send Lakshmana back to Ayodhya, apprehending trouble for Kousalya and
others in the hands of Kaikeyi. Lakshmana however refuses to return to Ayodhya, pleasing his
inability to survive in the absence of Rama. Rama thereafter agrees again for Lakshmana's stay in
the forest with him.

Shlok 1: Rama, the foremost of those affording happiness to others, reached the aforesaid
tree, worshipped the western twilight and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 2: "This might which has got past us today outside the inhabited territory is the first
night which has passed without Sumantra. You ought not repent over it."

Shlok 3: "Remaining free from lassitude, we must both keep awake during nights, from today
Lakshmana! The safety and welfare of Sita indeed depend on us two."

Shlok 4: "Let us pass this night anyhow, Lakshmana! Let us lie down on the ground, covering
it by straw, leaves and so on, procured by our own hands."

Shlok 5: Streching himself on the bare ground, Rama, who was accustomed to a luxurious coach,
uttered the following suitable words to Lakshmana:

Shlok 6: "Assuredly the emperor is sleeping badly tonight, while Kaikeyi, having realized her
ambitions, ought to feel satisfied."

Shlok 7: "Seeing Bharata returned, queen Kaikeyi, I am afraid, may not expel the lives of the
emperor for the sake of kingdom."

Shlok 8: "Aged and (therefore) helpless, deprived of my presence, what will he do, dominated
as he is by his passion for Kaikeyi and who has fallen into the clutches of Kaikeyi."

Shlok 9: "Reflecting on this misfortune of the king and his mental derangement, I deem that
passion alone is greater than early gain and religious merit."

Shlok 10: "what man however deluded, what father on account of a woman, at his own will and
pleasure, abandon a son like myself?

Shlok 11: "Alas, Kaikeyi's son Bharata (alone) is happy along with his wife. Like an overlord,
he is going to enjoy the prosperous kingdom of Kosala."

Shlok 12: "Father is superannuated. I am staying in the forest. Bharata will become the prime
head for the entire kingdom."

Shlok 13: "He who pursues sensuous pleasures neglecting his real interests and discipline soon
comes to distress; in the same way as king Dasaratha has."

Shlok 14: "It seems that Kaikeyi came into our house, oh good brother, to bring about an end
to Dasaratha, to send me into exile and to secure kingship for Bharata."

Shlok 15: "Blinded by pride of good fortune, Kaikeyi may even now persecute Kausalya and
Sumitra because of their relationship with me."

Shlok 16: "Queen Sumitra is likely to suffer hardship because of her affinity to us. From this
very place, you proceed to Ayodhya next morning, oh, Lakshmana!"

Shlok 17: "I shall proceed to Dandaka forest alone with Sita, while you will be the protector
for Kausalya, who has no defender."

Shlok 18: "Kaikeyi of base deeds may resort to unjustified means to be disliked. Give (for
protection) my mother to Bharata, oh virtuous Prince!"

Shlok 19: "In some other (past) birth, women must have been deprived of their sons by my
mother (Kausalya), oh, Lakshmana! For that reason this has arisen certainly."

Shlok 20: "At a time when Kausalya should have obtained benefits for her labors repaid by me,
she has been deprived of my company by me, who was nurtured by her for a long time and brought up
with great pains. Woe to me."

Shlok 21: "Let no woman ever give birth to such a son as myself, who have caused perpetual
grief to my mother, oh, Lakshmana!"

Shlok 22: "Oh, Lakshmana! I think that myna (which is kept as a pet by mother Kausalya) is
more affectionate than I, since her are heard the words, "Bite, oh parrot, the foot of the
enemy."

Shlok 23: "What can be done by me, her son, who cannot go to her aid even a little to her, my
mother, who is weeping, who is unfortunate and who has no son, oh conqueror of foes?"

Shlok 24: "Kausalya my mother of poor luck indeed, bereft of me, is stricken with great
melancholy and lies plunged in a sea of grief"

Shlok 25: "Enraged, I can subdue with my arrows single handed not only Ayodhya but also the
earth. But it is not a question of valor here."

Shlok 26: "Oh, the sinless Lakshmana! I am terribly concerned of doing wrong and of ruining my
prospects in the other world. Hence, I do not allow myself to be crowned."

Shlok 27: Rama during the night in that lonely forest, wailed piteously thus and in so many
other ways and sat quite, his face full of tears.

Shlok 28: Lakshmana consoled Rama as follows when the later had ceased lamenting like a fire whose flames had gone out and as a sea without a violent motion.

Shlok 29: "The city of Ayodhya, now that you have come away from it, has certainly been
divested of its splendor and resembles a night without the moon, Oh, Rama the jewel among armed
warriors!"

Shlok 30: "It is not proper, oh Rama, that you should grieve in this way. You cause distress
to Sita and me too, oh jewel among men!"

Shlok 31: "Oh, Rama! Bereft of you , neither Sita nor I will not survive even for a moment,
like fish pulled out of water."

Shlok 32: "Oh, Rama causing pain to the foes! Without you, I do not wish to see either our
father or Satrughna or Sumitra or even the heaven."

Shlok 33: Then Rama and Lakshmana the lovers of piety, sitting comfortably there and on seeing
a bed well- prepared under a banyan tree, sought for the bed.

Shlok 34: Attentively hearing Lakshmana's words which were excellent and wholistic and
adopting for a fairly long period the course of conduct prescribed for hermits, Rama resolved to
spend all the fourteen years in exile with Lakshmana.

Shlok 35: Thence forward, those two powerful offspring of the Raghu race (Rama and Lakshmana)
never admitted fear or agitation (while dwelling) in that vast and lonely forest any more than a
couple of lions on the slopes of a mountain.



SARGA 54
------------------------------

[Text] Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana reach the hermitage of Bharadwaja, situated a the
confluence of Ganga and Yamuna rivers. The sage Bharadwaja extends hospitality to them and
recommends Chitrakuta as the fittest place for them to sojourn in. Spending the night in discourses
on various matters with him, the sage grants him leave early next morning to depart for
Chitrakuta.

Shlok 1: Having spent the beautiful night under the big tree, Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana
started from that place when the immaculate sun had risen.

Shlok 2-3: Having penetrated into a deep forest, they the illustrious trios, while seeing many
stretches of land and at some places, attractive scenery never seen before, proceeded in the
direction of that region where river Yamuna was flowing forth towards river Ganga, associated with
the name of Emperor Bhagiratha.

[Commentary] Comment: Emperor Bhagiratha had the credit of bringing down the stream to the
terrestrial plane by dint of his devotion and austerities in order to purify the ashes of his
departed grand uncles.

Shlok 4: Observing various trees while walking at ease, Rama spoke to Lakshmana (as follows)
when the day had just receded.

Shlok 5: "Perceive, Oh Lakshmana, the smoke looking prominent as a sign of the glorious god
of fire near Prayaga (the confluence of the holy Ganga and Yamuna rivers). I think that sage
Bharadwaja is staying nearby."

Shlok 6: "We have certainly reached the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Yes, the noise
produced by clashing of waters is heard."

Shlok 7: "Pieces of timber split up by men who are dependent upon forest-products, as also
these trees of various kinds are seen in the hermitage of Bharadwaja."

Shlok 8: Having walked comfortably, Rama and Lakshmana wielding their bows, reached the abode
of the sage Bhardwaja, near the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna, while the Sun was falling to
the west.

Shlok 9: Having reached the hermitage and scaring the beasts and birds (by his very
appearance as a bowman) and having proceeded on the intervening path for a while, Rama approached
the vicinity of Bharadwaja.

Shlok 10: Arriving at the hermitage, the two valiant princes, who wished to see the sage,
accompanied by Seetha, halted at first at some distance off.

Shlok 11-12: Entering the hermitage and beholding the high-souled sage who was austere and
contemplative, his glance sharpened through severe meditation, surrounded by a group of disciples,
who had kindled sacrificial fire, the highly fortunate man as he was, Rama together with Lakshmana
and Seetha greeted him with joined palms.

Shlok 13: Rama (the elder brother of Lakshmana) introduced himself to the sage as follows: "Oh
venerable sage! We both are Rama and Lakshmana the sons of Dasaratha."

Shlok 14: "Here is my blessed and irreproachable wife Seetha, daughter of Janaka who has
accompanied me to the lonely forest suitable for religious austerities."

Shlok 15: "While I was being sent to exile by my father, my young and beloved brother
Lakshmana (son of Sumitra) of firm vows has also followed me to the forest."

Shlok 16: "Oh, Venerable sage! Commanded by our father, we are entering a lonely forest to
practise asceticism, living on roots and fruits."

Shlok 17: Hearing the words of that virtuous prince (Rama), the pious minded sage Bharadwaja
then offered Madhuparka* as well as water to wash his hands with.

[Commentary] Comment: Madhuparka is a traditional offering which consists of a mixture of
curds, butter, honey and the milk of the coconut as a welcome-drink.

Shlok 18: The sage, who had practiced austerities, gave them various kinds of delicacies
prepared from wild roots and fruits and also arranged accommodation for them.

Shlok 19: Honouring with words of welcome, the sage Bharadwaja seated, being surrounded on all
sides with beasts, birds and hermits, spoke thus to Rama.

Shlok 20: Bharadwaja then said these endowed with righteousness to Rama, who had since taken
his seat after accepting the aforesaid hospitality:

Shlok 21: "In fact, I am seeing you, arriving here after a long time, Oh scion of Kakutstha!
And I have heard of your unjust banishment."

Shlok 22: "This holy place at the confluence of the two rivers is secluded and delightful. You
stay here comfortably."

Shlok 23: Addressed in these words by Bharadwaja, Rama, born in Raghu dynasty, for his part,
interested in the welfare of all, replied in the following pleasant words.

Shlok 24-25: "The people of the city and the rural folks Oh venerable sir, are nearer to this
place. Finding me easy to see at this place, people keen to see Seetha and myself, I presume, will
make their appearance at this hermitage. For this reason, I do not wish to stay here."

Shlok 26: "See some excellent Seetha suitable for a hermitage in some lonely place, Oh
venerable sir, where Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who is worthy of every comfort, may find
delight in it."

Shlok 27: Hearing these auspicious words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage then for his part
spoke these suggestive words.

[Commentary] The said commentator. According to the latest measurements, the distance is
calculated as eighty miles. Making allowance for the difference in the standard of measurement
abtaining in those days the figure arrived at by the learned commentator appears to be fairly
concet.

Shlok 28-29: "Sixty miles from here, dear son, lies a sacred mountain on which you may takeup
your dwelling, which region is inhabited by great sages, is charming to look at from all sides,
infested by the black species of monkeys with a long tail, haunted by apes and bears, known by the
name of Chitrakuta and which closely resembles Gandha maadana mountain."

[Commentary] The author of commentary known by the name of  Ramayana Siromani'construes the
word   Dasha' in the sense that it should be split up as   Dasha cha, Dasha cha, Dasha cha(meaning
three times then = thirty Kroshes) Since 1 krosh= 2 miles, 30 kroshes= 60 miles and thus
approximate to the figure worked out by the said commentator. According to the latest measurements,
the distance is calculated as eighty miles. Making allowance for the difference in the standard of
measurement abtaining in those days the figure arrived at by the learned commentator appears to be
fairly concet.

Shlok 30: "As long as a man observes the peaks of Chitrakuta mountain, he will perform
virtuous deeds and will never set his mind on a sin."

Shlok 31: "On that mountain, many sages having spent hundred years in austerities as though in
sport , ascended to heaven, duly attaining their final emancipation."

[Commentary] Kapaala Shiras is the name of Shiva which means happiness or final
emancipation.

Shlok 32: "I consider that mountain to be a very lonely and comfortable place for you to live
in. Orelse stay with m here itself, during the period of your exile, Oh Rama!"

Shlok 33: The pious sage Bharadwaja fulfilled all desires of Rama; who was his beloved guest
and who was accompanied by his consort, Seetha and his brother, Lakshmana.

Shlok 34: While Rama, having approached that great sage at Prayaga(the confluence of Ganga and
Yamuna), was discoursing on various topics, the auspicious night arrived.

Shlok 35: Greatly fatigued, Rama(Scion of Kakutstha) accompanied by Seetha as the third
(Lakshmana being the second) who was accustmed to all comforts, happily spent that night at the
lovely hermitage of Bharadwaja.

Shlok 36: When the night was gleaming into a dawn, Rama the lion among men approached the sage
Bharadwaja, who was gleaming with resplendence and spoke as follows:



"We have lodged in your hermitage tonight, Oh venerable sir! (Pray) you give us
permission for fixing our residence now, Oh sage practicing truthfulness !"

Shlok 38: That night having come to an end, Bharadwaja replied for his part, as follows:
"Proced to Chitrakuta, rich in honey, tubers and fruits."

Shlok 39-40: "I consider the abode of Chitrakuta as the right place for you to stay, Oh Rama,
possessed of great strength! You set off for that well-known, sacred and lovely mountain,
Chitrakuta which is adoned with clusters of trees of every description, frequented by Kinnaras and
Nagas, is rendered charming by the cried of peacocks and infested with lordly elephants and
bountiful with tubers and fruits."

Shlok 41: "Since herds of elephants and troops of deer wander all around in the woodlands
there, you will visibly notice them Oh Rama!"

Shlok 42: "Roaming about with Seetha, your mind will be delighted to see rivers, cascades,
peaks of mountains, fissures in rocks, caves and rivulets."

Shlok 43: "After reaching the auspicious and absolutely beautiful Chitrakuta mountain,
reveberant in all direction with the notes of small white cranes and cucukoo birds as well as with
many kinds of deer and elephants in rut, settle down there in a hermitage."



SARGA 55
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Bharadwaja informs the route by which Rama and Lakshmana can reach Chitrakuta.
They cross the River Yamuna by a raft prepared by themselves. Seetha prays the River Yamuna and a
fig tree called Syama. The three of them traveled for a couple of miles along the bank of Yamuna,
strolling in the charming forest and reach a leveled ground on the bank to take rest for the
night.

Shlok 1: Having stayed that night there, those princes the annihilators of enemies,
thereafter offered salutation to the sage Bharadwaja and proceeded towards that mountain of
Chitrakuta.

Shlok 2: That great sage Bharadwaja performed a religious rite ensuring a sage journey
(scattering boiled rice on the ground and invoking blessing through the repetition of certain
sacred texts0 for them. Perceiving them setting out for the journey, the sage accompanied them for
a distance, as a father would do for his sons (and daughter-in-law).

Shlok 3: Bharadwaja the great sage with a remarkable splendour began to speak the following
words to Rama the truly brave man.

Shlok 4: "After approaching Oh, the best of men! The confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, follow
the river Yamuna which takes to the direction of west."

Shlok 5: "Reaching the River Yamuna belonging to olden times, having a rapid stream and
perceiving in it a passage for descent into the river, which is too much frequented the river,
which is too much frequented, you cross the River Yamuna (the daughter of the sun-god) by preparing
a raft there, Oh Rama!"

Shlok 6-7: After crossing the river Yamuna and approaching a large banyan tree named Syama
(dark-green) having green leaves surrounded by many tress and visited by Siddhas, Seetha should,
joining her palms, recite her auspicious prayers to the tree."

Shlok 8: "Having approached that tree, you can stay there or go beyond it. After going only
for two miles from there, you will see a beautiful forest blue in colour with bamboo trees touching
upon Yamuna river and interspersed with Sallaka and jujube trees."

Shlok 9: "It is the way to Chitrakuta. I visited that place many times. It is beautiful,
endowed with serenity and free from forest-fire."

Shlok 10: Having thus informed the way and ebbing urged by Rama to return after he had paid
obeisance to the sage and Rama having replied ï¿½so be it', the great sage Bharadwaja returned.

Shlok 11: That sage having returned, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: "Oh Lakshmana! We are
fortunate that the sage has shown compassion towards us."

Shlok 12: Deliberating thus, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men who were highly
intelligent, headed for the river Yamuna guarding Seetha still in front.

Shlok 13: Having reached the River Yamuna, running with rapid stream, all of them then plunged
into a thought of how to cross those river-waters.

Shlok 14: Then, Rama and Lakshmana prepared a big raft with pieces of timber fastened
together, covered with a kind of grass and spread over with dry bamboo canes.

Shlok 15: Thereafter, the valiant Lakshmana made for Seetha a comfortable seat, after chopping
branches of reeds and of rose apple tree.

Shlok 16: Then Rama the son of Dasaratha helped Seetha his beloved consort who was
unimaginable like the goddess of fortune and who was feeling shy a little- to mount the raft.

Shlok 17: Rama kept the two robes the jewellery, a shovel and a basket by the side of Seetha
in the raft there, along with weapons.

Shlok 18: Those valiant sons of Dasaratha firmly held that raft, firstly helped Seetha to
ascend it and then ferried across the river watchfully.

Shlok 19-20: Having arrived at the middle of Yamuna river, Seetha offered salutation to the river
and prayed as follows: "Oh, goddess of Yamuna! Adieu! I am crossing you! May my husband complete
his vow! When Rama safely comes back again towards the city of Ayodhya, ruled by Ikshvaku kings I
shall propitiate you by offering a thousand cows and a hundred drinking vessels."

Shlok 21: Seetha of excellent complexion thus praying with joined palms to Yamuna River,
forthwith reached the southern side of the river.

Shlok 22: Thus, by the raft, Seetha Rama and lakshmaNa crossed the River Yamuna, which flows
briskly, wreathed with waves, with many trees born on its bank and having rays for it
reflection.

Shlok 23: They, who have crossed the river, abandoned the raft and march through the
river-forest of Yamuna and reached a cool banyan tree called Syama having green leaves.

Shlok 24-25: Having approached that banyan tree, Seetha spoke these words, "Oh, great tree!
Obeisance to you! Let my husband complete his vow! Let me see again Kausalya and the illustrious
Sumitra." Thus speaking, Seetha circumambulated that tree with joined palms.

Shlok 26: Seeing the irreproachable Seetha, who was beloved and obedient to him thus praying,
Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 27: "Oh, Lakshmana, the excellent of men! You take Seetha and proceed in the front. I,
along with weapons, will follow you behind."

Shlok 28: "Give to Seetha whatever fruit or flower she desires it and wherever this Seetha's
mind finds delight."

Shlok 29: Seetha who was walking in the middle of both of them was like an auspicious female
elephant in the middle of two elephants.

Shlok 30: That Seetha asked Rama whenever she saw the one or the other tree or a bush or a
creeper shining with flowers which was not seen earlier.

Shlok 31: Duly grasping Seetha's words; Lakshmana brought to her many kinds of beautiful twigs
of trees, full of flowers.

Shlok 32: Then Seetha the daughter of King Janaka was please to see the River Yamuna with
wonderful sands and waters re-echoing to the cry of swans and cranes.

Shlok 33: Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and
Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.

Shlok 34: Having strolled in the charming forest, mad noisy by a number of peacocks and which
was inhabited by elephants and monkeys and reaching an agreeable level ground at the bank of the
river wearing an undejected look finally sought for an abode for the night.



SARGA 56
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana reach the mountain of Chitrakuta, beholding and showing
one another the grandeur of the woods there. They visit the hermitage of sage Valmiki. Lakshmana
builds a leaf-hut upon instructions from Rama. All of them enter the hut, after performing
purification ceremony.

Shlok 1: Then, Rama gently woke up Lakshmana, who was sleeping without break, even when the
night was passing away.

Shlok 2: "Oh, Lakshmana! Hear the sound of wild animals, resounding beautifully. It is time
for our journey. Let us start."

Shlok 3: That Lakshmana who was sleeping, being woken up by his brother at the right moment,
had relinquished sleep, sloth and strain which resulted on the way.

Shlok 4: Thereafter, all of them raised up touched the auspicious water (took bath) in the
river and proceeded towards the path leading to Chitrakuta mountain, as suggested by the sage
Bharadwaja.

Shlok 5: Rama who set out along with Lakshmana at that dawn, spoke as follows to Seetha whose
eyes looked like lotus leaves.

Shlok 6: "Oh, Seetha! Behold Kimshuka trees with their diadem of flower blossoming all over,
as if they are blazing up, in this winter."

Shlok 7: "Look at these Bhallataka (cashew nut) trees, abounding in flowers and bent down
with fruits and leaves, all unplucked by men. We can certainly live here."

Shlok 8: "Oh, Lakshmana! Behold in every tree the hanging honey-combs, with sizes of a
water-trough, gathered by honey-bees.

Shlok 9: In this beautiful forest-region, dense with a scattered mass of flowers, a Chataka
bird is crying and a peacock is responding to it."

Shlok 10: "See this Chitrakuta mountain with a high and mighty peak, wide-spread with a
multitude of elephants and made to resound by a congregation of birds."

Shlok 11: "Oh, brother! We shall sport in this forest of Chitrakuta, having a level-ground
beautifully extensive with many trees and is pure."

Shlok 12: Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha traveling on foot, approached the
mountain of Chitrakuta, which was pleasant and lovely.

Shlok 13: Reaching that mountain, with various flocks of birds, with many roots and fruits,
lovely and rich in streaming water, Rama said to Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 14: "It is appearing to me that this beautiful Chitrakuta mountain yields an easy
sustenance, for, it is charmingly filled with various kinds of trees and creepers with different
kinds of roots and fruits."

Shlok 15: "Oh, gentle brother! High souled sages are also staying on this mountain. Let this
become the dwelling. Let us have a pleasant resort here."

Shlok 16: After deciding thus Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana all with joined palms approached the
hermitage and offered salutation to the sage Valmiki.

Shlok 17: The great sage Valmiki, who knew what is right, full of delight, treated them with
honour, offered cordial welcome and requested them to sit.

Shlok 18: Then Rama, the lord with mighty arms, in accord with tradition, reported to the
ascetic all that concerned them and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 19: Lakshmana, my gentle brother! Bring strong and choicest timber and construct a
dwelling. My mind is fascinated in dwelling here."

Shlok 20: Hearing those words of Rama, Lakshmana brought various kinds of trees. Thereafter,
he the annihilator of enemies, constructed a leaf-hut.

Shlok 21: Seeing that hut, which was firmly built and thatched as well as beautiful to look
at, Rama spoke the following words to Lakshmana who listened to his command and who was closely
attentive to him:

Shlok 22: "Oh, Lakshmana! Bring the meat of an antelope. We shall perform a purifactory
ceremony while entering the house. Which is to be done by those who wish to live long."

Shlok 23: "Oh, large-eyed Lakshmana! Killing the antelope quickly, bring it here. The
prescribed rite according to scriptural point of view indeed is to be performed. Keep in mind the
sacred obligation."

Shlok 24: Lakshmana the slayer of enemies, understanding his brother's words, acted as
instructed. Rama spoke again to Lakshmana as follows.

Shlok 25: "Oh, gentle brother! Boil this antelope's meat. We shall worship the leaf-hut. This
day and this instant also are of a distinctive character. Be quick."



Then, Lakshmana the strong man and son of Sumitra, killing a holy back antelope,
tossed it in an ignited fire.

Shlok 27: Feeling certain that it is cooked and heated thoroughly with no blood remaining,
Lakshmana spoke to Rama the lion among man as follows:

Shlok 28: "This black antelope, with its complete limbs, has been cooked completely by me. Oh,
Rama resembling God! Worship the concerned deity, as you are skilled in that act."

Shlok 29: Rama, the virtuous man and the learned man in chanting of sacred spells, after
taking bath and with subdued mind, briefly chanted all the sacred scripts to be chanted at the end
of a purifactory ceremony.

Shlok 30: Worshipping all classes of deities and getting himself purified, Rama entered the
house. There was a heartful joy in rama, with his limitless splendour.

Shlok 31-32: Having taken bath in the river as prescribed Rama offered oblations to Lord Rudra
and Lord Vishnu after offereing tributes to Vaisvadeva. He performed benedictions relating to the
purification of house and also a silent prayer as per prescribed rites. He finally offered
excellent tributes to the deities, for removing sins.

[Commentary] Comment. Vaishvadeva: A religious ceremony which is to be performed every
morning and evening and especially before the mid-day meal, followed by offering of food to the
gods especially the god of fire.

Shlok 33: Lakshmana erected altars in all the quarters of the hermitage as was fitting,
Chaityas (places for worship of Lord Ganesha and others) and Ayatanas (places for worship of Vishnu
and others)

Shlok 34-35: Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha, having auspicious characteristics, satisfied
the sirits by crowns of flowers obtained in the forest, by fruits roots and cooked meat, by water,
by prayers as uttered in the sacred texts (Vedas), by sacred grass, by fuel and Kusa grass and then
entered the auspicious leaf-hut.

Shlok 36: All of them (Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana) together for residential purpose, entered
that hut, thatched with leaves of trees, looking beautiful, well-constructed at a suitable site and
protected from winds, as if entering an assembly-hall called Sudharma (in heavn) by a group of
celestials.

Shlok 37: Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana who subdued their senses, very happily strolled in that
excellent forest, filled with many classes and multitude of beasts and birds, trees having
multi-coloured crowns of flowers, and resonating with sounds of elephants in rut and of
antelopes.

Shlok 38: Delighted and joyful to reach the lovely Chitrakuta mountain and the river
Malyavati, provided with good descents and frequented by birds and beasts, Seetha, Rama and
Lakshmana shed the agony caused by their exile from the City of Ayodhya.



SARGA 57
------------------------------

[Text] Sumantra takes leave from Guha, who learns from his spies that Rama departed for
Chitrakuta. Sumantra drives back to Ayodhya. Entering the royal gynaeceum, he submits to the
emperor what he earlier reported to the citizens who followed his chariot. Dasaratha and Kausalya
fall into a faint to hear about Rama's departure for Chitrakuta. All the inmates of gynaeceum weep
loudly in anguish.

Shlok 1: While Rama landed upon the southern shore, Guha conversed for a long time with
Sumantra and with much distress, went to his house.

Shlok 2: It was gathered by those who were there (Guha and others) about Seetha, Rama and
Lakshmana coming to sage Bharadwaja, their staying with him in Prayaga and their departure to
Chitrakuta Mountain.

Shlok 3: Sumantra, being allowed to depart by Rama, tied excellent horses to the chariot and
with intense anguish, rode towards the very city of Ayodhya.

Shlok 4: Sumantra, seeing the sweet-smelling woods, rivers, lakes, villages and towns on the
way, soon crossed them.

Shlok 5: Reaching Ayodhya in the evening time of the third day Sumantra saw that city,
joyless.

Shlok 6: Beholding Ayodhya as if deserted in silence, Sumantra becoming very much distressed
in mind and having afflicted with intense anguish, surmised as follows:

Shlok 7: "I hope the city of Ayodhya with its elephants, horses, people and the kings was not
burnt away by a fire of sorrow and blazing grief towards Rama.

Shlok 8: Sumantra, thus lost in thought, reaching the city-gate through the fast-running
horses, entered the city quickly.

Shlok 9: Meanwhile, seeing Sumantra the charioteer approaching, hundreds and thousands of
people ran towards him asking, "Where is Rama?"

Shlok 10: He replied them thus: "Bidding farewell to Rama at the shore of Ganga when sent back
by that virtuous and high-souled Rama, I returned here."

Shlok 11: Hearing that Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana had crossed River Ganga, the people with
their faces filled with tears sighed, "Oh, fie upon us! And cried aloud, "Alas, Rama!"

Shlok 12: Sumantra also heard the words of those people standing in groups and telling, "Lost
indeed are we, who do not see Rama here!"

Shlok 13: "Never again can we see the pious Rama on the occasions of bestowing gifts,
sacrificial performances or marriages or in large meetings.

Shlok 14: The city of Ayodhya was protected by Rama, as by a father, with due regard to what
was appropriate, what was congenial and what brought happiness to its people.

Shlok 15: While driving through bazaars, Sumantra heard the sounds of lamentation of women,
coming forth from windows, consumed by anguish on account of Rama's exile.

Shlok 16: Going through the middle of the royal highway, Sumantra by covering his face,
reached the house of Dasaratha.

Shlok 17: Sumantra descended from the chariot, entered quickly the royal palace and traversed
the seven inner apartments of the palace, filled with a large number of people.

Shlok 18: Then, finding the forthcoming Sumantra from their large mansions, from seven-storied
buildings and from royal palaces, the women who had been emaciated in not being able to see Rama,
cried "Alas! Alas".

Shlok 19: Those women, extremely confounded with grief with their long and bright eyes filled
with a stream of tears, looked at each other imperceptibly.

Shlok 20: Sumantra also heard the feeble conversation of Dasaratha's wives absorbed in anguish
on account of Rama's exile, from their respective inner apartments.

Shlok 21: "What Sumantra will reply to the lamenting Kausalya, when he now returns here
without Rama while he formerly went out with Rama?"

Shlok 22: "In spite of her son (Rama) having left Ayodhya, Kausalya continues to survive. I
think that surely it is difficult thus to live and it is not so easy to preserve it too!"

Shlok 23: Hearing those credible words of Dasaratha's wives, Sumantra all at once entered the
house, that appeared to be set ablaze with grief.

Shlok 24: Sumantra entered the eighth inner apartment and saw in that white house, King
Dasaratha the miserable the sick and the exhausted man on account of the exhausted man on account
of the grief for his son.

Shlok 25: Sumantra approached that king who was seated, offered his salutation and presented
Rama's message as told.

Shlok 26: That king heard silently the message of Rama, was bewildered, afflicted by grief,
for his son, became fainted and fell on the ground.

Shlok 27: The king thus having fainted, the gynaeceum was hurt. While the king was falling on
the ground, the inmates of gynaeceum wept, raising their hands in distress.

Shlok 28: Kausalya along with Sumitra lifted up their husband, who fell on the ground.
Kausalya also spoke these words to Dasaratha.

Shlok 29: "Oh, illustrious king! Why are you not speaking to this Rama's messenger who came
from the forest and who has done difficult things?"

Shlok 30: "Oh, Dasaratha! After doing an evil act, you are now feeling shameful. Rise up! Let
it be a meritorious act for you. You cannot get a help, when you weep like this."

Shlok 31: "Oh, king! On whose fear, you are not enquiring with Sumantra about the welfare of
Rama, that Kaikeyi is not here. Speak fearlessly."

Shlok 32: Kausalya, speaking excitedly in tears and entirely given up to anguish uttered thus
to the monarch and soon fell to the ground.

Shlok 33: All those women cried in loud voice, seeing Kausalya fallen on the ground weeping as
aforesaid and gazing their husband too (lying unconscious).

Shlok 34: Hearing that crying sound raised in gynaeceum, all aged and young men and women on
all sides gathered around weeping. The city then again became disturbed.



SARGA 58
------------------------------

[Text] As per the orders of king Dasaratha, Sumantra delivers the parting messages of Rama
and Lakshmana. Rama sends positive messages to Kausalya and Bharata but Lakshmana sends angry
messages to Dasaratha.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, the king when recovered from loss of consciousness and again returned to
his breath, he called that charioteer for the purpose of getting the report on Rama.

Shlok 2-3: Then, Sumantra, who joined his palms in reverence, approached the monarch who was
repenting about Rama alone, filled with pain and sorrow, advanced in age, greatly anguished,
sighing like a newly caught elephant and reflecting on something as a sick elephant.

Shlok 4: The king, having great distress, spoke to Sumantra, whose body was covered with
dust, his face filled with tears, who was miserable and who approached near him (as follows):

Shlok 5: "Oh, Sumantra! Where can Rama the virtuous man abide, taking refuge at the root of a
tree? What that Rama, who enjoyed very many pleasantries, can eat now?"

Shlok 6: "Oh, Sumantra! How can Rama the prince, who was habituated to good beds, sleep with
such discomfort on a floor like an orphan?"

Shlok 7: "Foot soldiers, Chariots and elephants used to follows whenever Rama was marching
ahead. How such a man can take shelter and stay in a forest devoid of people?"

Shlok 8: "How Seetha Rama and Lakshmana entered forest filled with wild animals and black
snakes?"

Shlok 9: "Oh, Sumantra! How those princes with Seetha the delicate and the poor lady went on
foot, after descending from the chariot?"

Shlok 10: "Oh, Sumantra! You have seen my sons entering the forest, as though divinities of
Aswini had entered the Mountain-range of Mandara. You are indeed lucky."

Shlok 11: "Oh, Sumantra! After reaching the forest, what words did Rama speak? What did
Lakshmana speak? What did Seetha speak?"

Shlok 12: "Oh, charioteer! Tell me where Rama sat, slept and took food. By hearing these
things, I shall survive, as Yayati survived in the company of saints."

[Commentary] Comment: King Yayati, when doomed to fall from heaven requested Indra to cast
his lot with saints. He was accordingly sent down to a spot on the earth, where four ascetics-
Astaka Pratardana, Vasuman and King Sibi had been practicing austerities, and had discourse with
them- Mahabharata, Adi Parva.

Shlok 13: As asked thus by the king, Sumantra spoke to the emperor in a voice quivering and
choked with tears (as follows).

Shlok 14: "Oh, emperor! Rama, keeping up the prescribed course of conduct, making salutation
with joined palms and bowing his head in reverence to you, spoke to me as follows:"

Shlok 15: "Oh, charioteer! Tell my salutations to my father, the one with a remarkable
intellect, a mighty soul and the one to be respectfully greeted."

Shlok 16: Oh, charioteer! Enquire about the health of all the people in the gynaeceum without
any disparity and offer my appropriate salutations to them.

Shlok 17: My mother Kausalya is to be told about my welfare, about my offering salutations to
her and about my meticulousness.

Shlok 18: "Oh, godly lady! Be always righteous and be interested in offering worship and
sacrifices as per the prescribed timings in the House of Fire worship. Nurture the feet of the Lord
Dasaratha, like with a god."

Shlok 19: "Oh, mother! Behave towards my other mothers, abandoning self-conceit and
indignation. Make the venerable Kaikeyi, agreeable to the king."

Shlok 20: "In respect of Bharata your son, follow a respectable behaviour as with a king.
Kings are indeed sovereign in substance. Remember the rules relating to kings."

Shlok 21: "Bharata is to be enquired about his well-being and he is also to be informed as
follows: "Follow good behaviour indeed judiciously towards all your mothers."

Shlok 22: "The mighty armed Bharata the son of Ikshvaku race, is to be told as follows: ï¿½Being
installed in the office of Prince Regent, attend to your father who still stays in the
throne'."

Shlok 23: "The king has crossed his age. But do not depose him on that score. By proceeding
according to the orders of the king, you live as a prince."

Shlok 24: "Shedding tears profusely, Rama again spoke to me as follows : ï¿½My mother, who is
very much longing her son, is to be looked after by you as if she is your mother'."

Shlok 25: "Oh, emperor! Rama of the most beautiful appearance with red eyes resembling red
lotus flowers, while even uttering these words to me profusely shed tears."

Shlok 26: "But Lakshmana was very angry and breathing a sigh, spoke to me as follows: ï¿½On
which offence this prince was expelled from home?'"

Shlok 27: "The king even took shelter under a wretched decree of Kaikeyi and performed an act
not to be done, as though it is a proper deed, for which we are now tormented."

Shlok 28: "Even if this was done for the good pleasure of the king or through the will of God,
I do not see any justification for Rama's abandonment."

Shlok 29: "Even if this was done for the good pleasure of the king or through the will of god,
I do not see any justification for Rama's abandonment."

Shlok 30: "Rama's exile, an illegal decision undertaken whether due to levity of judgment or
due to lack of reflection, will raise countless protests."

Shlok 31: "I do not consider the emperor as my father. For me, Rama is the brother, lord,
relative and my father."

Shlok 32: "Leaving Rama the beloved of all people and who is interested in the welfare of all
human beings, how would all these people would be interested in you by this act of yours?"

Shlok 33: "By banishing Rama who is delightful to entire people and who is a virtuous man and
by opposing all this entire world, how will you stay as a king?"

Shlok 34: "Oh, King! The wise Seetha for her part with her mind like one possessed and
forgetting her own existence, stood sighing and static.

Shlok 35: "The illustrious Seetha having not seen such misfortune earlier, could not even to
speak me anything, weeping as she was with that uneasiness."

Shlok 36: "Seeing me going back, Seetha with emaciated face, perceiving her husband, soon shed
down tears."

Shlok 37: "In the same way, Rama with tears on his face and with joined palms, stood being
shielded by the arms of Lakshmana. The miserable Seetha in the same manner was weeping and seeing
the royal chariot and me."



SARGA 59
------------------------------

[Text] Sumantra narrates the ghastly fate of Ayodhya, both its animate and inanimate
beings. Dasaratha laments and soon falls unconscious.

Shlok 1: "Rama having departed to the forest, horses on the return path however, shedding
warm tears, did not proceed further on the way."

Shlok 2: "I, on my part, offering salutation with joined palms to both the princes and
keeping back from that grief, ascended the chariot and moved on."

Shlok 3: "With the hope that I shall be called again by Rama, I stayed there along with Guha
for three days."

Shlok 4: "Oh, emperor! Even trees in your domain have withered, without giving flowers
sprouts and buds, having emaciated due to Rama's separation."

Shlok 5: "Rivers, pools and lakes were with hot water. Groves and gardens were with their
leaves, parched up."

Shlok 6: "Living beings are not moving. Wild animals too are not roaming around. That forest
became silent, predominated by grief towards Rama."

Shlok 7: "Oh, emperor! Lotus-lakes were with lotus-leaves hiding under water pressing
themselves closely together, with muddy waters, with parched lotus-flowers and in which fish and
water fowls have completely disappeared."

Shlok 8: "Water-born flowers and flowers living on dry lands now give very little fragrance
and fruits do not have a luscious look as before."

Shlok 9: "Oh, best of men! The gardens here are empty of men and the birds have vanished. I
am not seeing the gardens as charming (as before)."

Shlok 10: "Nobody greeted me, entering into Ayodhya City. Having not seen Rama, the people are
breathing their sigh of lamentation again and again."

Shlok 11: "Oh, emperor! Seeing the royal chariot returning here without Rama, all the people
along the royal high-way are shedding tears with grief."

Shlok 12: "Seeing the returned chariot, women from mansions, seven-storied buildings and royal
palaces are crying ï¿½ha ha!', being troubled by the non-appearance of Rama."

Shlok 13: "Women, being more sorrowful, are looking at each other indistinctly with their long
bright eyes overwhelmed with a flood of tears."

Shlok 14: "I do not see any distinction in their agony, whether they are non-friends, friends
or neutral people."

Shlok 15-16: "Oh, emperor! The city of Ayodhya with its joy-less people, with its elephants and
horses looking miserable, with sighing exhaustion due to cries of pain, filled with sounds of
moaning, cheerless and feeling anguish due to Rama's exile, appears to me, like Queen Kausalya
without her son."

Shlok 17: Hearing Sumantra's words, the king in a voice choked with tears and very much
woeful, spoke to that charioteer as follows:

Shlok 18: "Enjoined by Kaikeyi with her sinful birth and intention, I could not deliberate
with people experienced in counsel or with elders beforehand."

Shlok 19: "This act has been done by me in haste due to infatuation for the sake of a woman,
without consulting with friends or ministers or with interpreters of sacred texts."

Shlok 20: "Oh, Sumantra! This great calamity, surely, has come as an inevitable consequence or
for the ruin of this race or accidentally."

Shlok 21: Oh, sumantra! If at all I have done any favour to you, lead me fast to Rama. My
vital spirits are hastening me."

Shlok 22: "If there is the same unlimited authority of mine even now, let Rama be brought back
to Ayodhya. I cannot survive without Rama even for a moment."

Shlok 23: "Or perhaps Rama the mighty-armed might have gone a long way. Make me to ascend the
chariot and quickly show me to Rama."

Shlok 24: "Where is that Rama having pearl-like teeth and wearing a large bow? If only I can
see him well with Seetha, I can survive."

Shlok 25: "If I cannot see Rama having red eyes, mighty arms and with ear-rings made of gems,
I shall proceed to the world of Death."

Shlok 26: "What is more distressing to me after getting into this condition, in not seeing
here, Rama who is a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty?"

Shlok 27: "Oh, Rama! Oh, Younger Brother of Rama! Oh, unfortunate Seetha! You do not know that
I am dying with grief, like one abandoned."

Shlok 28: King Dasaratha, his mind very much despaired with grief and plunged in an ocean of
sorrow, very difficult to be crossed, spoke (as follows)

Shlok 33-36: "Oh, Queen Kausalya! I am plunged in this ocean of grief. Its area of sorrow is for
Rama. its other shore is Seetha's separation. Its waves and huge whirlpools are sighs of anguish.
It is agitated with water and foam as tears. Throwing away of arms is the swarm of fishes. Its
great sounds are cries of lamentation. The scattered hari is its duck-week. Kaikeyi is its
submarine fire. Which is the cause for the rush in my tears. The words of the hum-backed are its
huge crocodiles. Its shores are the boons asked by the cruel Kaikeyi. Its long stretch is due to
sending of Rama to far away place. I cannot cross this ocean alive, without Rama. What a pity!"

Shlok 33: "Though I want to see Rama and Lakshmana now, I am not able to see them here. It is
very bad." - thus lamenting, the king of great renown soon became unconscious and fell down on his
couch.

Shlok 34: Hearing his words lamenting as much as twice more pitiably for Rama and the king
having fallen unconscious, Kausalya was alarmed once again.



SARGA 60
------------------------------

[Text] Sumantra was unable to console Kausalya, who lied on the floor due to her extreme
grief over her separation from Rama, even though he tries to avert her grief by telling her that
Rama can reside in the forest delightfully, by warding off his agony.

Shlok 1: Then, Kausalya, trembling again and again, as though possessed by a spirit, and
lying on the floor without proper disposition of mind, spoke to Sumantra as follows:

Shlok 2: "Wherever Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana are there, take me to them. Without them, I do
not cherish to live here even for a moment."

Shlok 3: "Turn back the chariot quickly. Take also myself to the forest of Dandaka. Now, if I
do not go after them, I shall enter the Death's abode."

Shlok 4: Sumantra with joined palms and with a voice choked with tears and in faint accents,
consoling Kausalya, spoke these words to her.

Shlok 5: "Abandon grief, delusion and haste born of affliction. Rama, can reside in the
forest, warding off anguish."

Shlok 6: "Lakshmana too, knowing about a righteous conduct, having subdued his senses and
serving the feet of Rama in the forest, is propitiating the other world."

Shlok 7: "Seetha, getting a dwelling place resembling a house even in a lonely forest, her
mind encamped in Rama and being fearless, is acquiring confidence.

Shlok 8: "Not even very minute depression, even a little, is seen developed in Seetha. It
appears to me as though Seetha is accustomed to so many exiles."

Shlok 9: "Seetha is taking delight in the desolate forests in the same manner as she was
earlier enjoying in visiting gardens in the city."

Shlok 10: "Seetha, a charming woman with her face resembling a full moon and with her mind
absorbed in Rama, even though staying in a lonely forest, is enjoying it like a little girl."

Shlok 11: "Seetha's heart is directed towards Rama. Her life also is dependent on him. Even if
Ayodhya is without Rama, then it becomes a forest to her."

Shlok 12-13: "As if only a couple of miles away from Ayodhya and as being in a garden there,
Seetha on seeing villages, towns, movement of rivers, and various types of trees, enquires with
Rama or Lakshmana and Knows well about them."

Shlok 14: "I am remembering only these incidents about Seetha. It does not flash to my mind
now of the words hurriedly spoken of by Seetha about Kaikeyi."

Shlok 15: Expunging the remarks spoken by Seetha about Kaikeyi coming almost nearer to his
lips by inadvertence, Sumantra spoke only delightful and sweet words to Kausalya.

Shlok 16: "Seetha's radiance resembling a moon's gleam is not fading away due to her travel in
the forest or due to the velocity of wind or because of her bewilderment or due to heat of the
sun."

Shlok 17: "That face of altruistic Seetha resembling a lotus flower, whose lustre is similar
to that of a full moon, did not become changed."

Shlok 18: "Her feet, which even though no longer painted with vermilion, still looks red as
Alakta (red juice obtained from resin of certain trees), with lustre equal to that of red lotus
buds."

Shlok 19: "Seetha, sporting her tinkling anklets, walks playfully. Even now, Seetha dons her
ornaments, as a mark of Her passion towards Rama."

Shlok 20: "Seetha who stays in the forest, takes refuge in the arms of Rama and hence does not
give Herself to fear, even by seeing an elephant or a lion or a tiger."

Shlok 21: "There is no need to pity them nor us nor the king too. This story will thrive in
the world forever."



"Abandoning grief, possessing cheerful minds, settling well in the path followed by
great sages, delighting in the forest-life and eating fruits of the forest, they are keeping up the
promise given to their father."

Shlok 23: Even if averted thus by Sumantra, who is speaking appropriately well, being
emaciated by sorrow for her son, could not stop crying, "O, my dear son Rama!"



SARGA 61
------------------------------

[Text] Kausalya, while weeping, rebukes Dasaratha for his evil act of sending Rama to
exile. She explains various difficulties being faced by Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha in their
forest-life. She says that even if Rama returns to Ayodhya in the fifteenth year, he may not accept
the kingdom since enjoyed by Bharata.

Shlok 1: When Rama, who is excellent in virtue and outstanding among those causing delight,
having left for the forest, Kausalya who was feeling pained, spoke, weeping to her husband as
follows:

Shlok 2-3: "Despite the fame in the three worlds of your great glory that Dasaratha is
compassionate, bountiful and kind in his words, how your two sons along with Seetha who grew
comfortably can bear suffering in the forest when faced with hardships, O the best among the
foremost of men!"

Shlok 4: "That Seetha, who is a young lady in the prime of her youth and very delicate, can
really tolerate heat and cold?"

Shlok 5: "How the large-eyed Seetha can eat a food prepared with wild rice, she having eaten
here a good food containing soups and snacks?"

Shlok 6: "How that irreproachable Seetha can hear the horrid sounds of cruel animals and
lions, after hearing the auspicious sounds of singing and music here?"

Shlok 7: Where Rama the mighty hero, resplendent as Mahendra's standard and the mighty armed
is sleeping indeed with his arm as a pillow?"

Shlok 8: "When can I see the face of Rama with the colour of a lotus, framed with marvelous
locks of lotus-perfume, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and excellent?"

Shlok 9: There is no doubt that my heart is fully made of the solid-interior of a diamond,
for which reason this heart is not shattered into a thousand pieces, even in my not seeing of that
Rama."

Shlok 10: "It was not a kindly act by you that you banished my kith and kin, who were worthy
of comforts to wander around in the forest in such a miserable condition."

Shlok 11: "Even if Rama comes back in the fifteenth year, it cannot be inferred that Bharata
will abandon the kingdom and the treasury."

Shlok 12: "There are those who in a ceremony in hour of dead relatives, first feed their
relatives and thereafter, to fulfill their duty, remember to invite the illustrious Twice-born.

Shlok 13: "The virtuous and the learned Brahmins, who are like unto gods, do not accept
afterwards even food as delicious as ambrosia."

Shlok 14: "The best of Brahmins in their wisdom, will not accept what remains of the food of
which other Brahmins have partaken, regarding it as a bull shorn of its horns."

Shlok 15: "O, king! Why not the eldest and the best brother refuse to accept the kingdom
enjoyed by the younger brother?"

Shlok 16: "A tiger does not wish to share a part of food eaten by another animal. In the same
manner, Rama the tiger among men may not accept that which has been enjoyed by another."

Shlok 17: "Oblations, clarified butter, leavings of an offering, sacred grass and sacrificial
posts made of trunk of Khadira tree, once used, are not put to use again in a sacrifice."

Shlok 18: "Thus, Rama cannot accept the kingdom taken away by other, as those not accepting an
ambrosia whose essence has been taken away or as in a sacrifice, stalks of Soma plant (from which a
beverage called Soma is prepared) are lost."

Shlok 19: "Rama will not go through such a type of dishonour, as a strong tiger does not
endure even touching of its tail."

Shlok 20: "Even if all the worlds combine together in a great battle, they cannot stir up fear
in him. The virtuous minded Rama will provide righteousness to the people with
unrighteousness."

Shlok 21: "Rama with great prowess and with his mighty arms can surely burn up all beings and
even the ocean itself by his golden arrows; like at the time of destruction of the world."

Shlok 22: "That excellent man with such a lion's strength and with eyes like those of a bull
was ruined indeed by his own father, like killing its child-fish by an adult fish."

Shlok 23: "A son, who is devoted to righteousness, has been sent to exile by you. Is it a
right thing for you, as seen by scriptures or is it an eternal conduct as practiced by the Twice
born?"

Shlok 24: "O, king! A husband is a chief refuge for a woman. Her second refuge is a son. The
third refuge is her near-relative. There is no fourth one here."

Shlok 25: "Among those three refuges, you do not indeed exist. Rama on his part took refuge in
a forest and I do not wish to go there. Thus, I have been ruined in all ways, by you."

Shlok 26: "This kingdom along with neighboring states has been ruined by you. You yourself
along with ministers have been ruined. I along with my son are ruined. Citizens too are ruined.
Your son Bharata and your wife Kaikeyi only are delighted."

Shlok 27: Hearing the aforesaid voice of Kausalya, consisting of her cruel words, the king
also being distressed, became disillusioned. Thereafter, the king then looking back on his own evil
act, was entangled in grief



SARGA 62
------------------------------

[Text] After hearing harsh words from Kausalya, king Dasaratha loses consciousness and
restores it after a long time. Afterwards, Kausalya repents for her mistake of speaking such crude
words and consoles the king with her reconciliatory words. Overcome by grief, Dasaratha fell into
the grip, Dasaratha fell into the grip of slumber as the night prevailed.

Shlok 1: When harsh words with anger in this manner by the grief-stricken Kausalya, Rama's
mother were heard, king Dasaratha felt depressed and reflected upon them.

Shlok 2: The king fell brooding thus perplexed as he was in his mind and lost his
consciousness. Thereafter, that king who torments the enemies regained his consciousness after a
long time.

Shlok 3: After restoring his consciousness he, breathing a long and hot sigh and seeing
Kausalya by his side, began to worry again.

Shlok 4: As he thus brooded over, he recalled in his mind, a sinful deed that was done by him
out of ignorance long ago, by shooting with an arrow an unseen object, the sound of which was only
heard.

Shlok 5: The mighty emperor felt distressed through agony caused by that sinful dead and as
also through agony caused by separation from Rama and was tormented by the dual grief.

Shlok 6: That king, tormented by the afflictions, was trembling, bent his head down, joined
his palms in salutation, desirous of getting her grace and spoke to Kausalya as follows:

Shlok 7: "O, Kausalya! I seek your grace. This joining of palms is set out by me. You are
always affectionate even towards others and even indeed kind."

Shlok 8: "O, queen! For women reflecting on righteousness, a husband whether he is virtuous
or worthless, is a visible god indeed."

Shlok 9: "You as such, who is ever intent on virtue, who has understood good and evil
fortunes in the world, even if grief-stricken, ought not to have spoken unpleasant words to me, who
is too much in distress."

Shlok 10: Hearing those miserable words spoken by the distressed king, Kausalya shed tears,
akin to new rain water flowing from channel.

Shlok 11: Capturing on her own head, the king's palms joined in the form of a lotus, Kausalya
was scared and spoke weeping in hurriedly lettered words in eagerness.

Shlok 12: "O, king! I appeal to you with my bowed head. I lie prostrate on the floor. I am
ruined. I am not to be forgiven indeed by you."

Shlok 13: "O, Valiant man! In both the worlds, it is ill-becoming of a woman, being
propitiated by her husband, who is praise worthy and possessing good disposition."

Shlok 14: "O, valiant man! In both the worlds, it of a woman, being propitiated by her
husband, who is praise worthy and possessing good disposition."

Shlok 15: "Grief ruins courage. Grief ruins sacred learning, grief ruins all. There is no
enemy like grief."

Shlok 16: "A hitting that descended from the hands of an enemy is possible to be tolerated.
But, the grief suddenly descended, even if so small, is not possible to be tolerated."

Shlok 17: "O, valiant man! Even ascetics, who know righteousness, who have learnt sacred texts
and who have rent asunder doubts relating to religious merit and wealth, go astray having their
minds infatuated with grief."

Shlok 18: "Today it is counted as five days since Rama has gone to exile. It is equal to five
years for me, since grief has ruined my happiness."

Shlok 19: "While I think of Rama, this grief in my heart is increasing, like water in a great
ocean increases with the fast streaming of rivers.

Shlok 20: While Kausalya was telling auspicious words indeed as aforesaid the sun became
feeble and turned towards night too.

Shlok 21: The king, thus cheered up by the queen Kausalya, got subjected to slumber, after
having been overcome by grief.



SARGA 63
------------------------------

[Text] Dasaratha woke up with anxious thoughts. Recalling his earlier sin, he starts
recounting the story of a young ascetic to Kausalya. He says that while he was Prince Regent of
Ayodhya, he went out for hunting in a forest one day and heard the sound of a hermit-boy filling
his pitcher with water by suberging it into Sarayu River. Mistaking the gurgling sound for
trumpeting of an elephant the prince hit the boy with an arrow, which went deep into the body and
mortally wounded him. On approaching the victim, he discovered the fatal blunder and tendered his
heart felt apologies to the hermit boy, who asked him to extract the arrow from his body and inform
his parents. The boy died soon after the arrow was drawn out from the body.

Shlok 1: The king, awakened after some time, with his mind afflicted with grief, got into an
anxious thinking.

Shlok 2: Due to banishing of Rama and Lakshmana, a great calamity befell on Dasaratha who was
equal in strength to Indra like sun seized by obscurity, which is attributed to the demon Rahu.

Shlok 3: After Rama along with his wife departed to the forest, Dasaratha the king of Kosala
recalling his earlier sin, wanted to tell Kausalya, whose eye-corners were dark in colour all about
it.

Shlok 4: After Rama was sent into exile to the forest, King Dasaratha, on the sixth night at
mid-night, was recalling his sin done (long ago).

Shlok 5: King Dasaratha, afflicted by grief for his son, recalling his sin, spoke the
following words to Kausalya who was suffering from sorrow for her son.

Shlok 6: "O, blessed lady! O gracious one! A doer reaps surely the fruit of his own deeds
corresponding to the nature of work either good or bad, of that which he does!"

Shlok 7: "He who does not consider, while undertaking actions, the relative value of their
fruits as well as the utilities or defects accruing from them, is surely called a fool."

Shlok 8: "Anyone, who after seeing their (charming and big) flowers, greedily desires their
(large and luscious) fruits and nourishes Palasa trees, by cutting off a mongo grove, he will come
to grief after bearing of their fruit."

Shlok 9: "He who without knowing the result goes running towards action, will come to grief
as a nourisher of Kimsuka trees coming to grief at the time of their fruit-bearing."

Shlok 10: "I nourished Palasa trees, by cutting off mango grove. Being wicked-minded in
abandoning Rama at the time of arrival of fruit, I am lamenting thereafter."

Shlok 11: "This sin was done by me while I was young and wielding a bow. At that time, I was
famous as a young man, who can shoot heard (but unseen) object by an arrow, O Kausalya!"

Shlok 12: "This grief, obtained by my own accord, has befallen me, as by a boy in ignorance
eating poison in the world; O, Kausalya!"

Shlok 13: "How the other man became disillusioned by Palasa trees, I also became disillusioned
in the same manner, without knowing accurately the correct result of hitting a target by means of
sound only."

Shlok 14: "O, Kausalya! You were unmarried till then and I was the Prince Regent. Then came
the rainy season which enhanced excitement and desire (for hunting)."

Shlok 15: "The sun, partaking fluids from earth and warming the world with its rays, entered
the terrible southern quarter haunted by spirits."

Shlok 16: "Heat disappeared suddenly. Resplendent clouds appeared in the sky. All frogs,
cuckoos and peacocks were full of joy."

Shlok 17: "Birds with moistened top of their wings as if they bathed, reached with great
difficulty the trees, the tops of which were shaken off by rain and wind."

Shlok 18: "Enveloped by water falling again and again on the water already fallen, the
mountain with its antelopes in rut, glowed like an ocean."

Shlok 19: "Although the water-streams were crystal clear, they flowed in serpentine courses,
with white and red colours because of their admixture with ashes and mountain-minerals on the
way."

Shlok 20: "The water-streams, which were crystal-clear till then, became churned with reddish
waters, carrying water by a wrong way, after the onset of rain."

Shlok 21: "With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I went
along Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows."

Shlok 22: "Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffalo
or an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose of
drinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place."

Shlok 23: "Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to the
bank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there."

Shlok 24: "Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the sound
of a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant."

Shlok 25: "With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling a
serpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it."

Shlok 26- 27: "I released a sharp arrow, resembling a serpent. There, at dawn, arose a distinct
voice uttering 'Ah! Ah!' of a forest-inhabitant, dropping down in water after his vital part was
hit by an arrow."

Shlok 28: "While that arrow was attacking a human voice there was heard, saying, 'Oh, how a
weapon did rush upon an ascetic like me?' "

Shlok 29: 'I came to the river, which is away from habitation, in the night to fetch water. By
whom I was hit by an arrow? On the other hand what wrong have I done to anyone?"

Shlok 30: "To a seer like me, of having laid down violence and living a fruits and roots of
wild plants in the forest, how a killing by an arrow is enjoined?"

Shlok 31: "Who is desirous of killing me, wearing a mass of locks of hair and clad with bark
of trees and deer-skin? What harm was done to him by me?"

Shlok 32: "A vain act concerning only with a useless objective is undertaken in this manner.
No one will admire him, as for instance like any man seeking the bed of his preceptor's wife, as
good."

Shlok 33: "I do not worry that much of my death. I worry both for my mother and father, in the
case of my death."

Shlok 34: 'By what means of livelihood this elderly couple, maintained since a long time by
me, support themselves when I obtain my death?'

Shlok 35: "I and my aged parents are killed by a single arrow. By a man without self control
and being very much a fool, all of as are virtually killed."

Shlok 36: "Hearing those pitiable words and since I was always intent on righteousness, I felt
distressed. The bow and arrow fell down from my hands to the ground."

Shlok 37: "Hearing his pathetic cry, weeping profusely during the night, I became unconscious
frequently, utterly bewildered as I was, due to flare-up of my grief."

Shlok 38- 39: "Distressed in mind and with much sorrowful feeling, I reached that place and saw
the ascetic, hit by the arrow at the bank of Sarayu River, with his tresses of hair scattered, his
pitcher of water thrown asunder, having his limbs anointed with sand and blood lying down as he
was, hurt by the arrow."

Shlok 40: Looking up with his eyes, as if going to scorch with his glory, at me who stood
terrified and sick in mind, he spoke those harsh words then:

Shlok 41: "O, king! I, who was carrying water for my parents, was hit by you. What was the
harm done to you by me who is residing in a forest?"

Shlok 42: 'Being hit on my secret part by a single arrow, you virtually killed both my mother
and father, who are blind and aged.'

Shlok 43: "Both of them, weak blind and thirsty, might have refrained their thirst with
difficulty and waited with expectation of my arrival since long. I am sure."

Shlok 44: 'Surely, our (mine or father's) religious austerity or sacred knowledge have not
borne fruit because my father does not have information about me, having fallen down and lying on
the ground.'

Shlok 45: "What my disabled father, unable to walk around can do, even if he knows like a tree
unable to protect another tree which is being cut off?"

Shlok 46: 'O, Dasaratha! Going there soon, you alone tell my father; so that he will not
scorch you by his anger, as a forest is scorched by a flared-up fire.'

Shlok 47: 'O, king! This foot-path will lead you to my father's hermitage. After going there,
seek his graciousness, lest he should get angry and execrate you."

Shlok 48: 'O, king! Extract this arrow-head from my body. This sharp arrow torments my
delicate vital part in the same way as a river-current corrodes the sandy bank, which is at a
height.'

Shlok 49: "While extracting the arrow-head from him, this thought entered my mind. With
arrow-head in his body he will suffer, even though surviving. But after extracting the arrow-head,
he will die."

Shlok 50: "Then, the son of the sage perceived worry in the heart of myself, who was lamenting
pitiably, suffering from anguish."

Shlok 51: Sinking into despondency with distress, distorting his limbs in agony, coiling round
himself on the floor with extreme pain and having approached the end of his life, he spoke to me
(as follows) with great difficulty.

Shlok 52: 'Suppressing my grief with firmness, I am becoming stable-minded. Let the torment in
your heart, caused by the thought of your having killed Brahmana be removed.'

Shlok 53: 'O, king the ruler of the country! I am not a Brahmana. Let there be no agony in
your mind. I am born through a Sudra woman by a Vysya.

Shlok 54- 55: "While he was speaking in that manner with great difficulty, his vital part having
been hit by an arrow and was rolling on the ground, now exerting himself, now trembling and
sinking, I drew out that arrow from him. That sage looked up towards me in fear and relinquished
his life."

Shlok 56: "O, my dear Kausalya! Seeing him, with his body drenched in water, weeping with
anguish, unceasingly sighing his breath, with injury in his vital part and lying down in River
Sarayu as he was, I became very much grief-stricken."



SARGA 64
------------------------------

[Text] King Dasaratha continued to narrate to Kausalya how he went to the aged parents of
the deceased sage and informed about the death of their son and its cause, how he escorted them to
their son to the river where he was lying dead, how embracing the boy they wept and offered
libations of water to his spirit, how invested with an ethereal body, the spirit ascended to heaven
while consoling the aged couple and finally how, having cursed the king that he too would die of
agony caused by the separation from his son, the aged couple gave up their lives. Having thus
narrated the story of his getting the curse long back and loudly weeping, king Dasaratha dies of
grief.

Shlok 1: The high souled Dasaratha, while lamenting about the unworthy killing of that sage,
spoke further to Kausalya as follows:

Shlok 2: Having done that great sin inadvertently, having my senses confounded and I being
alone, I thought of using my reason of what best can be done."

Shlok 3: "Taking the best water fully in that pitcher, I went to that hermitage by the path
as directed by the young sage.

Shlok 4- 5: "There I saw the frail, blind and aged parents of the young sage. They were without
a guide to support them, as birds whose wings were cut-off. Without any other occupation, they were
narrating words only about their son. Having no protector and being immobile they lost the hope of
their son, because of me."

Shlok 6: "With my mind afflicted by grief and worried about the impending peril, I fell a
prey to further grief after reaching the hermitage.

Shlok 7: "Hearing the sound of my foot-steps, that sage spoke as follows: "O, son! Why are
you late? Give me the water soon."

Shlok 8: "My dear son! Your mother is regretting why you are playing in water in this manner.
Enter the hermitage quickly."

Shlok 9: "O, son! My dear! If any disagreeable thing has been done by your mother, or me,
you, as a sage ought not have kept it in your mind."

Shlok 10: "We being helpless, you are our refuge. We being blind, you are our eyes. Our lives
are encircled around you. Why are you not talking with us?"

Shlok 11: "As though fearful in mind to behold the ascetic, I spoke to him in a tone which was
indistinct inarticulate and without some consonants?"

Shlok 12: "Having strengthened the firmness in my speech and having abandoned fear in my mind
by deliberate efforts, I told him of the alarm that awaited him of his son's death."

Shlok 13: "I am Dasaratha, belonging to warrior- class. I am not your high-souled son. This
calamity created by my own act, despised by noble men, befell upon me."

Shlok 14: "O, venerable sage! Wearing a bow in hand, I came to the bank of Sarayu River with
an intent to kill an elephant arrived to a ford (for drinking water) or any other wild animal."

Shlok 15: "Then by me was heard the sound of a pitcher being filled with water. Guessing it as
an elephant, I killed it with an arrow."

Shlok 16: "Thereafter, reaching the bank of the river there, I saw an ascetic lying dead on
the ground, with the arrow pierced into his heart."

Shlok 17: "O, honorable sage! With a desire to kill an elephant by targeting the sound, I
released an iron arrow, and thus your son was killed (hit)"

Shlok 18: "Approaching as per his request, closer to him who was suffering from pain, I took
out the arrow soon from his vital part."

Shlok 19: "Soon after taking out the arrow, he worried about both of you the parents,
lamenting that you were blind and there itself he attained Heaven"

Shlok 20: "Unknowingly and unexpectedly your son was killed by me. It has happened like that.
Let the honorable sage command me what to do in this matter."

Shlok 21: Hearing that cruel news pronounced by me, confessing my sin, that venerable sage
could not resist his severe anger."

Shlok 22: "That sage with great splendor, whose face was filled with tears and troubled by
sorrow, spoke with a sigh to me who came near him with joined palms"

Shlok 23: "If you have not told me about this shameful deed yourself, O. king, your head would
have burst instantly into a hundred thousand pieces."

Shlok 24: "A killing brought about by a warrior premeditatedly and in particular to a hermit,
would expel even Indra from his post."

Shlok 25: "The head of a dispatcher of a weapon with a knowledge of the matter on a sage
established in austerity or such an unmarried student practicing sacred study, gets burst into
seven pieces."

Shlok 26: "You are still surviving because you have done it unknowingly. Not even you, but
today the whole of Ikshvaaku dynasty would have been no more, if it is not the case."

Shlok 27- 28: "He spoke to me thus: "O, king! Now we want to see, as our last look, our son whose
body is drenched in blood, with his garment of deer-skin scattered from him, lying unconscious on
the ground and who is subjected to the dominion of Yama(god of death) . Take both of us to that
place."

Shlok 29: "Thereafter, taking both of them, who were weeping profusely, to that place, I for
one made that sage and his wife to touch their son."

Shlok 30: "Approaching their son, that miserable couple touched their son's body and fell on
it . Then, his father spoke as follows."

Shlok 31: "My dear boy! You are not offering salutation to me, nor do you talk to me. Why are
you sleeping on the floor? Are you angry?"

Shlok 32: "O, righteous son! I am beloved to you. Otherwise, see your mother. Why are you not
embracing, my son? Utter some words, O delicate youth!"

Shlok 33: "Whose sweet and heart touching voice, reciting one sacred text or the other in
particular at the end of the night, shall I hear from now?"

Shlok 34: "O, son! Who after taking bath, worshipping the goddess of dawn, and offering
oblations in fire, will be sitting beside me and talking confidently looking at me, as I was
afflicted with grief and fear?"

Shlok 35: "Who will feed me, like a beloved guest is fed, with roots and fruits while I am
sitting without any work, without fetching anything and without having any guide making me to
walk?"

Shlok 36: O, delicate youth! How can I support your mother, who is blind, aged and a poor
woman in a pitiable condition, longing for her son?"

Shlok 37: "O, son! Come to a halt. Do not go to Yama's abode. You can proceed tomorrow with me
and with your mother."

Shlok 38: "Bereft of you, afflicted with grief, without any protection in the forest and poor,
both of us also will come soon along with you to Yama's abode."

Shlok 39: "Thereafter, seeing Yama, I shall tell these words to him. ï¿½O, Yama! Excuse me. Let
this boy nourish his parents.' "

Shlok 40: "The most glorious and high souled Yama, the guardian of the world will be obliged
to give this solitary imperishable boon in the form of fearlessness to me, who is in such a
condition."

Shlok 41: "O, son! This criminal killed you. As it is true that you were sinless, you will
soon obtain the realms as reached by those who die fighting with weapons."

Shlok 42: "O, son! Move on to that which is the highest state, which is obtained by the
warriors, who do not return even while being killed, from the direction facing their enemies in
battles."

Shlok 43: "Obtain the destiny which was obtained by Sagara, Saibya, Dilipa, Janamejeya,
Nahusha and Dundumara."

Shlok 44- 45: "O, son! Obtain that destiny, which is obtained by all the sages, by those who
studied scriptures, by an act of austerity, by a gift of the land, by him who has maintained sacred
fire, who has taken a vow of marrying a single wife, who gifts a thousand cows, who are owed to the
service of the preceptor and that which is obtained by those who have abandoned their body (by
journeying to Himalayan Mountains, or drowning themselves in water or leaping into the flames)"

Shlok 46: "The one born in the race of sages will not obtain an unsafe destiny. The person,
who killed you, my son, will obtain that bad destiny."

Shlok 47: "Thus, that sage repeatedly wept there pitiably. Then he, along with his wife,
started doing the ceremony of offering water to his demised son."

Shlok 48: "The pious son of the sage on his part, soon ascended the Heaven, wearing a
wonderful form along with Indra (the king of celestials) as a result of his own pious acts."

Shlok 49: "That son of the sage who was together with Indra, talked to his parents. Consoling
his parents for a while, he spoke the following words."

Shlok 50: "I obtained the supreme state because of my service to both of you. You will also
obtain soon my vicinity."

Shlok 51: "The son of the sage, whose senses were subdued, thus spoke and by a wonderful aero
plane with beautiful form, quickly reached Heaven."

Shlok 52: "That ascetic with great splendor along with his wife soon performed the ceremony
offering water to his dead son and spoke to me, who was standing near him with folded hands."

Shlok 53: "O, king! You have made me, without a son, by killing my one and the only one son,
by an arrow. You kill me also now. I am not frightened about death."

Shlok 54: "Since you have killed my holy son through ignorance, I shall pronounce a most
painful and very cruel curse on you."

Shlok 55: "O, king! Even as I am suffering from agony now because of the loss of my son, in
the same manner; you will also die due to agony caused by the loss of your son."

Shlok 56: "O, king! Since the sage was killed by you, belonging to the warrior class, through
ignorance, the son of killing a Brahmin will not take possession of you."

Shlok 57: "A feeling similar to this, which makes the life awful and extinct, will indeed
quickly come to you, even as a merit accrues to the donor of a donation to the priest."

Shlok 58: "Pronouncing the curse thus on me, that couple wept many times pitiably, placed
their body on the funeral pile and proceeded to heaven."

Shlok 59: "O, Kausalya! The sin I myself committed through ignorance on that day, by invoking
an arrow and hitting an invisible object the sound of which was heard, I remember it now on
reflection over it."

Shlok 60: "O, Kausalya! As a disease comes sometime after eating a nutriment mixed with
forbidden things, this present occurrence came as a result of the sinful act by me long ago."

Shlok 61: "O, my dear lady! Those words of that noble sage, saying that I shall give up my
life due to grief for the loss of my son, have come true to me now."

Shlok 62: "O, Kausalya! I am not able to see you with my eyes. Touch me well" Thus speaking,
King Dasaratha, terribly weeping said to his wife as follows:

Shlok 63: "O, queen! The wrong that was done by me in respect of Rama was not befitting of me.
But the good that was done by Rama in my case was worthy only of him."

Shlok 64: "Which wise man on this earth can abandon his son, even if he is of a bad conduct?
Which son, even if he is sent to an exile, cannot become angry with his father?"

Shlok 65: "Can Rama now touch me or approach me forth with? Men who attained the world of Yama
(god of death) cannot even see their kith and kin."

Shlok 66: "O, Kausalya! I am not able to see you with my eyes. My memory- power is fading
away. Messengers of Yama (god of death) are hastening me to come."

Shlok 67: "What can be more sorrowful than the fact I am not able to see Rama, who knows
righteousness and who is a truly brave man, at the time of my death?"

Shlok 68: "The grief arising out of non-appearance of that son, who performs unparalleled
actions, is parching up my life, as sun- shine dries up a water drop"

Shlok 69: "They are not humans but celestials, who will be able to see again in the fifteenth
year, the beautiful face of Rama, wearing his handsome ear-rings."

Shlok 70: "The fortunate can see the face of Rama, looking like a moon, with its eyes
resembling lotus leaves, with beautiful eye brows, with a comely row of teeth and a charming
nose."

Shlok 71: "Fortunate are they, who can see the sweat smelling face of Rama, resembling the
autumnal moon and also a full- blown lotus."

Shlok 72: "Happy ones can see Rama, who having finished his exile, will come to Ayodhya like
the planet Venus coming from a journey."

Shlok 73: "O, Kausalya! My heart is sinking down by delusion of mind. I am not able to grasp
the related sound, touch and the smell."

Shlok 74: "All of my senses are getting scared away due to mental break down, as rays of light
of a lamp whose oil is exhausted, starts splattering."

Shlok 75: "This grief caused by my own self is collapsing me, who am helpless and insensible,
like a river bank being collapsed by the floods of a river stream."

Shlok 76: "O, mighty armed! O, Rama! O, annihilator of my grief! Alas! O, darling of your
father! O, my protector! O, my son! Where have you gone?"

Shlok 77: "O, Kausalya! O, Sumitra, the miserable! Alas! O, Kaikeyi, the cruel one! My enemy!
The disgrace of my family! I am going to die."

Shlok 78: In this manner, King Dasaratha weeping as aforesaid, reached the end of his life in
the presence of Kausalya and Sumitra.

Shlok 79: King Dasaratha of noble appearance, thus speaking, who was already miserable and
distressed for sending his son to exile, felt afflicted with extreme grief by the time the mid-
night passed and forthwith abandoned his life.



SARGA 65
------------------------------

[Text] At the dawn of the next day, panergysts and servants arrived at the palace to serve
the king. Some women, who were empowered to go near the bed, detected the king's death and started
crying loudly. Kausalya and Sumitra suddenly woke up from their slumber and came to know of the
king's death. All the wives of Dasaratha wept miserably. The gynaecium was filled with men and
women who felt bewildered with fear and restlessness; when the king met with his appointed end.

Shlok 1- 2: While the night passed away, there arrived at the residence of the emperor, at the
dawn of the next day, highly cultured and excellently learned bards who were pronouncers of
benedictions and whose custom was to eulogize the king, as well as singers and panegyrists uttering
recitations in different styles.

Shlok 3: Their sounds of praises, uttering benedictions in a loud voice and pronouncing
accolades of the king, pervaded in full the interior area of the palace.

Shlok 4: While those bards are uttering praises, others who make a bang of claps, patted the
claps, eulogizing the previous glorious acts of Dasaratha.

Shlok 5: The birds dwelling in royal palaces perched on the branches of trees and others in
cages were awakened by that sound and began to twitter.

Shlok 6: The auspicious words uttered by bards parrots etc and the notes of Vina as well as
blissful songs of the metric verses filled that palace.

Shlok 7: Then, as before, persons who maintain pure practices and those who were skilled in
the services to the king, most of whom were women and eunuchs, arrived there to serve the king.

Shlok 8: Those who took care of royal ablutions brought water sprinkled with yellow sandal in
golden pitchers in accordance with appropriate time and the set procedures.

Shlok 9: In that manner, women too most of whom were virgins brought all that were pleasing
to the touch, eatables, decorative clothing and ornaments.

Shlok 10: All that was brought near him was endowed with all auspicious characteristics
offered with reverence as per prescribed scriptures. All that was extremely graceful.

Shlok 11: All that retinue, greatly excited as they were, without coming near to the king and
with a suspicion as to what was it, stayed thus till sunrise.

Shlok 12: The women who were empowered to go near the bed of Dasaratha went in proximity to
him and woke him up.

Shlok 13: Even so, those modest and prudent women with proper conduct, touched Dasaratha's bed
and could not detect any sign of life whatsoever in him.

Shlok 14: Those women knew the condition of a body in sleep, by its gestures, movements and
others. As such, they were possessed of tremor apprehensive as they were about the king's life and
they resembled like tips of reeds standing against a stream.

Shlok 15: Now, seeing the king, certainty arose in the minds of those doubting women about the
calamity (of death) that was apprehended.

Shlok 16: Overpowered by grief for their sons, the slumbering Kausalya and Sumitra did not
wake up, as though they were completely overtaken by death.

Shlok 17: Kausalya bereft of luster, pale faced, emaciated with grief and dispirited, did not
shine brightly (as before) like a star hidden away in darkness.

Shlok 18: The queen Kausalya, immediately close to the king and with Sumitra on her side, was
not shining as before with her face ruffled by tears of grief.

Shlok 19: The persons in the gynaecium, having seen those distinguished queens in slumber and
also the king in that manner, thought that the king had lost his life while just sleeping.

Shlok 20: Then, those beautiful women miserably cried loudly with their voice, like female
elephants crying when their group leader an elephant was removed from their place in the
forest.

Shlok 21: Kausalya and Sumitra suddenly obtained consciousness by the sound of their cries and
woke up from sleep.

Shlok 22: Kausalya and Sumitra, on seeing and touching king Dasaratha, cried ï¿½O, Lord!' and
fell on the ground.

Shlok 23: Rolling on the floor and covered by dust, Kausalya the daughter of Kosala king was
not shining as before and resembled a star falling down from the sky.

Shlok 24: While the king was deceased, all the women saw Kausalya who fell on the floor
appearing as a female elephant, which was killed and felled on the ground.

Shlok 25: Kaikeyi and all other wives of king Dasaratha were weeping afflicted by grief and
fell unconscious.

Shlok 26: That great noise was supplemented by those wailing women, bloated by which, it
rendered the house all the more noisy.

Shlok 27- 28: That gynaecium of the king who met his appointed end was filled with people who felt
bewildered with fear and restlessness, with tumultuous wail all around, and crowded with relatives
disturbed by sorrow, with happiness withered away in it suddenly and became a sight of misery and
despondency.

Shlok 29: Knowing that the glorious king of excellence had passed away, the king's wives
surrounded him with great sorrow; pitiably wailing profusely and lamented, grasping their hands one
another, like orphans.



SARGA 66
------------------------------

[Text] Kausalya reproaches Kaikeyi for her wrong deeds, while weeping profusely for her
husband's death. The chamberlains reverently remove Kausalya from the place of the king's body,
which they later keep in a trough filled with oil. The ministers and other functionaries return to
their abodes, when the night fell in darkness.

Shlok 1-2: Seeing the aforesaid deceased king, who looked like a fully extinguished fire, a
waterless ocean and a lusterless sun, Kausalya holding the king's head on her lap with her eyes
full of tears and who was stricken with grief of various sorts, spoke to Kausalya as follows:

Shlok 3: "O Kaikeyi the cruel one and the doer of evils! You be there, having fulfilled your
desires. Deserting the king, you can enjoy the kingdom undisturbed and without any hindrance.

Shlok 4: "Rama has left me and gone to the forest. My husband too has left for heaven. I do
not wish to live, as one left behind by a caravan in a wrong road."

Shlok 5: "Which woman would wish to survive, leaving her husband who was divine, except
Kaikeyi who kicked off righteousness?"

Shlok 6: "A greedy person cannot understand one's faults, like one who eats a forbidden dish.
Due to that hump- backed woman, Kaikeyi has ruined the race of Raghu dynasty."

Shlok 7: "Hearing Rama along with his wife have been sent to exile by the king as he was
coerced as he was (Kaikeyi) to do an unworthy act, Janaka will profusely lament as I do."

Shlok 8: "Rama the pious man who is possessed of like lotus leaves, and who has disappeared
from here even though living, now does not know me to have because a support -less widow.

Shlok 9: "Even so, Sita, the daughter of king of Videha, the pitiable lady and who is
unworthy of lamentation, will get frightened with grief in the forest.

Shlok 10: "Greatly alarmed to hear the fearful cries of wild animals and birds making their
noises in nights, surely she will cling herself to Rama.

Shlok 11: "Janaka too who is aged, and who is not having sons, will be thinking of Sita, over
whelmed with grief and will surely abandon his life.

Shlok 12: "Today itself, I too in devotion to my husband, will meet my appointed end. I shall
enter the fire, duly embracing this body of my husband.

Shlok 13: The chamberlains reverently removed from that place that unfortunate Kausalya, who
was in excess of her grief and was closely embracing her dead husband.

Shlok 14: The ministers assigned for the job kept the king in an oil trough and did all the
acts that were to be done therafter.

Shlok 15: The ministers who were knowing all such matters were not willing to do cremation for
the king in the absence of his sons and that is why preserved the king's body .(in an oil
through).

Shlok 16: Seeing that the king was laid down in an oil through by the ministers those women in
the gynaacium cried "Alas! He is dead!"

Shlok 17: Crying their faces with eyes flowing with tears, the miserable women through up
their arms, stricken with grief as they were and pitiably lamented as follows:

Shlok 18: "Alas! Great king! When we are already deprived of Rama who speaks lovingly and who
always keeps up his promise, why have you left us?"

Shlok 19: "Far in distance from Rama, how shall we without our husband, live in proximity to
Kaikeyi of wretched nature, who killed her husband?

Shlok 20: "Rama, a protector to you and all of us as well as a capable, prudent and an eminent
man, has indeed gone on exile to the forest, leaving this lovely kingdom.

Shlok 21: "How can we, being disgraced by Kaikeyi, and stupefied by evil passion, live without
you and the heroic Rama."

Shlok 22: "Whom else will Kaikeyi by whom have been abandoned the king as well as Rama along
with Lakshmana great strength and Sita- not abandon?

Shlok 23: "With tears and excessive agony, those excellent Dasaratha's wives together in a
row, rolled on the ground, sorrowful as they were."

Shlok 24: The city of Ayodhya, bereft of the high-soled king Dasaratha, was splendour-less, as
a night without moon and as awoman without husband.

Shlok 25: With people disturbed with tears, with virtuous women raising cries of distress and
with its cross -roads and entrances of houses looking desolate, the city of Ayodhya did not shine
as before.

Shlok 26: While the king has gone to heaven due to grief and while the king's wives were lying
on the ground , the sun suddenly went away retreating its movement. The night approached, with its
darkness having proceeded to spread throughout.

Shlok 27: The friends and relatives who came there, did not like the king's cremation in the
absence of his sons. Thus thinking, they kept the king of inconceivable sight in that resting
place(oil- trough)

Shlok 28: Deserted by the high-soled Dasaratha, with its roads and cross roads filled with
people choked with tears in their throats, the city of Ayodhya, looking like sky without sun and
night with its multitude of stars disappeared, did not shine with its light having gone away.

Shlok 29: After the king's death, men and women in the city converged in groups, abusing
Bharata's mother, became disturbed and did not obtain happiness.



SARGA 67
------------------------------

[Text] That night in Ayodhya passed over with agony. At sunrise the Brahmins who enthrone a
person as a king, assembled and requested Vasista the family priest of Ikshvakus to select a youth
to be crowned as a king of Ayodhya. They enunciated the various evil consequences of allowing the
country without a king and leaving it in anarchy.

Shlok 1: That night in Ayodhya, which was joyless in a weeping tone and thronged with people
with tears in their throats, slowly passed over.

Shlok 2: At sunrise, when the night had passed over, the Brahmins who place a king on the
throne, together gathered at the assembly.

Shlok 3-4: Markandeya, Moudgalya, Vamadeva, Kasyapa,Katyayana, Goutama and the greatly famous
Jabali-all these Brahmans together with the ministers turned towards the excellent royal priest
Vasishta and one by one spoke as follows:

Shlok 5: "King Dasaratha having obtained death due to grief born of separation from his sons
(Rama and Lakshmana), the night which burdened like a hundred years, has passed over with great
difficulty."

Shlok 6: "The monarch has gone to heaven. Rama took retreat in a forest. The brilliant
Lakshmana followed suit and went along with Rama."

Shlok 7: "Both Bharata and Satrughna, the annihilator of enemies, are encamped in the
beautiful house of their maternal uncle in the city of Rajagriha in the kingdom of Kekaya."

Shlok 8: "Hence, let anyone here in Ikshvaku dynasty be made a king today itself lest our
nation without a king should result in a collapse indeed."

Shlok 9: "Lightning clouds in the sky with a great noise of thunder, will not yield rain on
the land in a country without a king."

Shlok 10: "Even a fist of seeds are not disbursed in a ruler- less land. In anarchy, even a
son is not amenable to the control of a father nor a wife in the authority of her husband."

Shlok 11: "In a rulerless land, there is no wealth. Where there is no king, there is no
(faithful) wife. Another very dangerous thing is there. In a ruler less territory, how can there be
truth? "

Shlok 12: "In a ruler- less country, people do not cause to make a delightful assembly nor
erect beautiful parks or temples."

Shlok 13: "In a ruler- less territory, those who frequently perform sacrificial rites, those
who have self-restraint, those who firmly adhere to a vow as well as Brahmins do not carry out Soma
sacrifices."

Shlok 14: "In a rulerless land, Brahmans who obtained wealth and sacrificers in great
sacrificial rites do not bestow proper gifts"

Shlok 15: "In a ruler- less territory, festivals and gatherings exalting the kingdom in which
actors, and dancers exhibit their talents are not frequently arranged"

Shlok 16: "In a ruler less land, litigants do not get their disputes settled and persons who
have a knack for narrating stories do not gratify story- lovers with their tales."

Shlok 17: "In a ruler less territory, girls adorned in gold do not go together to parks to
play there in the evening."

Shlok 18: "In a lord less land, lustful men do not go out to woods with ladies in speedily
moving vehicles"

Shlok 19: "In a lord less land, rich people living on agriculture and cattle rearing do not
sleep in their abodes well protected, with their doors open"

Shlok 20: "In a land without emperor, sixty year old elephants with bells tied around their
tusks, do not roam around on royal high ways

Shlok 21: "In a ruler less land, the noise of plucking the bow string with the palm, produced
by archers continuously discharging arrows while practicing the use of their bows, is not
heard."

Shlok 22: "In a rulerless land, traders who go to distant places, carrying with them several
merchandises, cannot travel safely in their voyages."

Shlok 23: "In a rulerless land, a monk who wanders alone, who has subdued his senses, who
mediates himself on the soul and who takes up an abode wherever evening overtakes him, cannot roam
around the city."

Shlok 24: "In a rulerless land; gain and security are not duly established. In anarchy, army
cannot conquer enemies in battle."

Shlok 25: "In a rulerless land, people beautifully adorned, cannot go fast cheerfully in
excellent horses and chariots."

Shlok 26: "In a rulerless land, persons skilled in sacred treatises cannot sit speaking
together in forests and groves."

Shlok 27: "In a rulerless land, floral garlands, sweet-meats and gifts for the sake of
offering to the deities, are not arranged by the appointed persons."

Shlok 28: "In a rulerless land, royal princes smeared with paste of sandal and aloe-wood do
not figure brilliantly like trees in a spring time."

Shlok 29: "A rulerless country is like the water less rivers, like the lawn less garden and
like the cowherd less cows."

Shlok 30: "A flag is an identity for a chariot. A smoke is an identity for a fire. King
Dasaratha, like a flag, was an identity for us and he has left the world for a heavenly abode."

Shlok 31: "In a rulerless land, there is no one's own property for any one. Like fishes,
persons always eat away each other."

Shlok 32: "The atheists, who were separated from their right path and who had been tormented;
with punishment earlier by the king, are now without fear and are able to exercise their old
temperament (due to anarchy)"

Shlok 33: "As the eye sight is helpful regularly for a proper setting -in-motion of the body,
so also a king is the cause of existence for truth and righteousness of a country."

Shlok 34: "The king is truthfulness and righteousness personified in him. In a race, he
belongs to a noble family. The king is a mother and a father. The king is a benefactor to
people."

Shlok 35: "Hence, Yama (the god of Death); Kubera (the god of riches), Indra (the ruler of
celestials) and the very mighty Varuna (the Lord of Waters) are outstretched by the a high and
eminent conduct."

Shlok 36: "Alas! If a king is not there in the world, with his power of discrimination between
good and evil, this world will be dark and nothing will be clearly perceived."

Shlok 37: "Even when the emperor was alive, we all of us did not transgress your words, only
any more than an ocean transgresses its coast."

Shlok 38: "O, the excellent Brahmana! After renewing the circumstances here and seeing that
the kingdom is becoming a jungle without a king, you yourself anoint a youth born in Ikshvaku race
or anyone here as a king."

ministers and to all the Brahmans (assembled there):

Shlok 2- 3: "Bharata, who was given kingdom (by Dasaratha) is staying very happily in his
maternal uncle's home, along with Satrughna. Hence messengers in fast running horses are to be sent
quickly to bring back those heroic brothers. What are we to think of further in this matter?"

Shlok 4: Then all of them uttered words agreeing to send the messengers quickly. Hearing
their words, Vasistha spoke as follows:

Shlok 5: "O, Siddhartha! O, Jay anta! O, Vijaya! O, Ashoka! O, Nandana! Please come. I am
telling you all. Hear that which is to be done"

Shlok 6: "After starting quickly from here by traveling in rapidly running horses, you reach
the city of Rajagriha. After relieving yourself of the grief, you have to tell Bharata these words
as my orders:"

Shlok 7: "The royal priest and other ministers are asking about your welfare. Come forth, by
starting quickly. There is a very urgent work with you."

Shlok 8: "After going there, do not tell him that Rama has gone to exile or that his father
is dead or about this calamity occurred to the descendents of Raghu dynasty."

Shlok 9: "Go quickly, taking silk clothes and excellent ornaments to the king and to Bharata
"

[Text] Bharata experiences a bad dream on that very night in which the messengers entered
the city of Girivraja. His friends in the palace arranged entertainment like recitation of stories,
playing of musical instruments, stage plays and jokes to make him cheerful. Even then, his
depression was not gone. Bharata explains in detail his unpleasant dream in its different forms to
his friends.

Shlok 1: On that very night those messengers entered the city; Bharata also had experienced
an unpleasant dream.

Shlok 2: Bharata, the son of Dasaratha the paramount sovereign, after seeing that unpleasant
dream just at the dawn of that night, felt very much anguished.

Shlok 3: Knowing Bharata to have been in anguish, his graceful speaking friends arranged
recitation of stories in the palace; so as to erase his anguish.

Shlok 4: Some played musical instruments for bringing about peacefulness. Likewise some
others arranged for exhibition of dramas and some others told various types of jokes.

Shlok 5: That high-soled Bharata born in Raghu Dynasty could not be made cheerful by his
gently speaking friends by stage-plays or jokes.

Shlok 6: A close friend spoke to Bharata, who was surrounded by his companions, as follows,
"O, friend! Why are you not rejoicing, even when entertained by your friends?"

Shlok 7: Bharata replied to the friend who spoke thus, as follows "You listen to me the
reason for which this depression came to me"

Shlok 8: "I have seen a dream in which my father with his soiled body and with his hair
disheveled, was falling from the top of a mountain into a polluted pond defiled with cow dung.

Shlok 9: "He was seen by me, as he was floating in that pond defiled with cow dung, drinking
an oil through his hollowed palms and laughing again and again"

Shlok 10: "Thereafter, having eaten cooked rice mixed with gingelly seeds repeatedly, with his
head bent down and with his whole body smeared with oil, he plunged into the oil itself

Shlok 11- 12- 13: "I saw in the dream, the ocean dry up, the moon fall on the ground, the earth
molested as if covered by darkness, a tusk of an elephant (on which the monarch rode) broken to
pieces, a blazing fire suddenly extinguished, the earth riven, the various trees dry up, and the
mountains whirl up into a mist."

Shlok 14: "I saw my father in the dream, wearing black clothes, sitting on a stool made of
iron and women with black and reddish brown complexion deriding the king."

Shlok 15: "My father, the virtuous man, adorned with red garlands and his body besmeared with
sandal paste and seated in a chariot drawn by asses, proceeded hurriedly towards the south."

Shlok 16: "I saw an ugly faced female demon, wearing red colored clothes, laughingly dragging
away the king.

Shlok 17: "This fearful dream was seen thus by me during that night. I myself or the king or
Lakshmana may die."

Shlok 18: "If in a dream, a person sees a man going in a chariot, yoked with donkeys, the
smoke of a funeral pyre will soon be seen ascending him."

Shlok 19: "For this reason, I have become broken hearted. Hence, I am not able to treat you
properly. My throat seems to be drying up. My mind is not at ease."

Shlok 20: "I do not see the root cause of this fear. But I am experiencing a fear indeed. My
voice is choked. My luster is affected. I abhor me myself and I do not see a reason for it."

Shlok 21: "That great fear is not going away from my heart, having seen such a course of this
bad dream in varied forms and which dream was not imagined by me earlier and also reflecting on
that inconceivable sight of the king."

Come forth indeed quickly. There is an urgent work with you."

Shlok 4: "O, Bharata the wide-eyed man! Take these very valuable clothes and jewels and give
them to your maternal uncle"

Shlok 5: "O, prince! In these jewels and clothes, a worth of hundred crores is to be given to
the king Kekeya and likewise a worth of ten crores in full to your maternal uncle."

Shlok 6: Bharata, who had a great affection towards his kind hearted relatives, took all
that, honored these messengers profusely with gifts of their liking and spoke(as follows) :

Shlok 7: "I hope that king Dasaratha, my father is quite safe. I also hope that Rama and the
high-soled Lakshmana are well."

Shlok 8: "Is Kausalya, the venerable lady, who is intent on virtue, who knows righteousness,
who visualizes goodness and who is the mother of the wise Rama, also well? "

Shlok 9: "I hope that Sumitra, who knows righteousness, who is the mother of Lakshmana as
well as the heroic Satrughna and our middle mother, is well."

Shlok 10: "As Kaikeyi, who loves herself, a forever fiery lady of wrathful nature, who prides
herself to be highly intelligent and my mother, also well? What did she say?"

Shlok 11: On hearing the words of the high soled Bharata, those messengers then respectfully
spoke to Bharata as follows:

Shlok 12: "O, tiger among men! Those, of whom you do enquire, are all well. The goddess of
prosperity, holding a lotus in her hand, awaits you. Let your chariot be made ready."

Shlok 13: Hearing the words Bharata spoke to the messengers as follows: "I will get permission
from the monarch(to leave for Ayodhya) saying that the messengers are hastening me up."

Shlok 14: Bharata the prince having been asked to move quickly (to Ayodhya) by the messengers,
spoke as aforesaid to those messengers and uttered the following words to his maternal uncle:

Shlok 15: "O, king! Requested by the messengers to come to Ayodhya urgently, I am going to my
father's presence. I shall again come, whenever you recall me."

Shlok 16: Hearing the words of Bharata, the king Kekeya, his maternal uncle smelled (as a
token of affection) the head of Bharata and spoke the following auspicious words:

Shlok 17: "Go, my dear child! I am permitting you. Kaikeyi is fortunate to have a good son
like you. Bear my greetings to your mother and father."

Shlok 18: " My dear child! Pay obeisance to your family priest, the other illustrious Brahmins
and your brothers Rama and Lakshmana the wielders of bows."

woolen clothes of varied colors, antelope skins and riches (gold and silver vessels etc).

Shlok 20: The king Kekeya generously gave as gifts to Bharata, two thousands coins of gold and
sixteen hundred horses.

Shlok 21: Likewise, Aswapati sent some attendants, who were dear, reliable, endowed with
virtues and inmates of his palace with Bharata (to accompany him on the return journey)

Shlok 22: Yuddhajit, his maternal uncle gave him as gifts, elephants of Airavata race born in
Indrasira mountain-range and which were charming to behold as well as mules which could walk
quickly and were well trained

Shlok 23: He gave as a gift, large bodied dogs, which were well nourished in the gynoecium,
possessing strength and vitality of a tiger and which were using their tusks as weapons.

Shlok 24: The wealth of gifts bestowed by the king Kekeya did not rejoice Bharata, Kaikeyi's
son, who was then in a hurry to go.

Shlok 25: Due to goading of messengers and visualization of the dream, a very big worry was
formed at that time in his heart.

Shlok 26: The glorious Bharata crossed his very big palace, augmented with men elephants and
horses and entered the excellent royal high way.

Shlok 27: The sagacious Bharata crossed the royal high way and perceived the gynoecia. Then,
the glorious Bharata entered those gynoecia.

Shlok 28: Bharata took leave of his maternal grandfather and also Yudhajit, his maternal uncle
and set out on a chariot (for Ayodhya) along with Satrughna.

Shlok 29: With more than hundred chariots variegated with jewels yoked to camels, bullocks,
horses and mules as also servants followed Bharata as he departed.

[Commentary] Instead of "rathaan maNdalachakraamshcha", "rathaan ratnavichitraamshcha" in the
old version is taken -as the clause "chariots with round wheels " appears to be meaningless.

Shlok 30: Being protected by the army, the high soled Bharata, who was free from enemies,
taking Shatrughna along with other companions good enough to him, started from the palace of his
venerable maternal uncle, as a Siddha(a semi- divine being of great purity and perfection and said
to possess supernatural faculties) would start from Indraloka( the world of celestials).

Ayodhya, which was earlier built by King Manu.

Shlok 18: Seeing the city of Ayodhya in front, after spending seven nights on his way, Bharata
the tiger among men, spoke the following words to his charioteer:

Shlok 19-20: "O, Charioteer! The famous city of Ayodhya comes into view vaguely to me from a
distance, as a heap of white clay. It has beautiful gardens. It is filled with performers of
sacrifices and with people endowed with good qualities as well as well versed in the Vedas and with
Brahmins inmost abundant reaches , It is being ruled by a royal sage."

Shlok 21: Earlier , a big clattering voice of men and women used to be heard all round in
Ayodhya. Now, I am not hearing that voice."

Shlok 22: "The parks which used to beam with men streaming forth on all sides, having given up
sporting in the morning after entering them in thee evening having spent the whole night in sport,
now appear to me otherwise"

Shlok 23: "These parks deserted by the lovers now turn out to be dejected . O, charioteer! To
me, the city appears to have changed into a forest."

Shlok 24: "Here, as before, important persons indeed are not seen going into the city or
coming out it in carriages or on horses or on elephants."

Shlok 25: "Earlier parks used to be conspicuously excited with joy and gaiety and were most
congenial for love contacts of men."

Shlok 26: "I am seeing the same parks., today with lack of enjoyments on all sides and with
trees having their leaves fallen along the road, looking like picture of dismay."

Shlok 27: "Even now at dawn, charming sounds with sweet and much melodious tone of animals and
birds intoxicated with happiness are not being heard."

Shlok 28: "Why does, as before, pure and auspicious breeze laden with aloes and sandal wood
intensified with the fume of burnt incense,not blow today.?"

Shlok 29: "Why today have the sounds of kettledrums, clay tomtoms and Vinas played upon with
drum-sticks or palms or fingers stopped which formerly never ceased at any time."

Shlok 30: "I perceive various kinds of evil sinful and silly omens and by this, my mind is
dejected."

Shlok 31: "O, charioteer! It is not possible that all sounds be well with my kinsfolk, as
indeed, even without anycause for a grievance, my spirit is cast down"

Shlok 32: Despondent, distressed in mind, frightened and extremely entered the city, which was
ruled by the descendents of Ikshvaku.

Shlok 33: Bharata, with his tiered horses entered the city through Vaijayanta gate. Greeted
with slogans of victory by the standing gatekeepers, he went inside, along with others.

Shlok 34: Bharata, with a distracted mind, responded to the salutations of those porters at
the gate and those porters at the gate and spoke to the charioteer who was beloved to Asvapati as
follows:

Shlok 35: "O, the faultless charioteer! Why was I brought so quickly without any reason? My
mind is apprehending some evil. I lost my all energy."

Shlok 36: "Whatever things were heard by us formerly in the same case of ruin of kings, I am
seeing here all those signs."

Shlok 37- 38- 39: "I am seeing the family horses in which dirt is not swept away, with their doors
wide open, bereft of splendor on all sides without any offerings being made, and with no incense
burned . Families are starving and people look miserably without any charming appearance."

Shlok 40: "The temples of gods are deserted and have lost their radiance, with their splendor
of floral decorations lost, nor are there any assembling to perform sacrifices as before."

Shlok 41: "Worships of the deities were placed aside. Assemblies of prayers are also not
adorned with saleable flowers and garlands today."

Shlok 42: "Even traders lost interest in trading tie-ups and their minds are tied up in
thoughts. They are not being seen here today, as before."

Shlok 43-44: "Clusters of birds in temples and large trees in the city are looking desolate. The
population of men and women in the city look thoughtful anguished weak messy and despondent with
their eyes held in tears."

Shlok 45: After seeing those bad omens in Ayodhya, the broken hearted Bharata spoke to the
charioteer as aforesaid and went to the royal palace.

Shlok 46: Beholding the city of Ayodhya,that formerly possessed the splendor of the capital
city of Indra, now with its squares houges and high ways deserted, the doors and hinges covered
with rust , Bharata was overcome with grief.

Shlok 47: Seeing many things disenchanted to mind which did not occur at any time before in
the city, the high soled Bharata with his head bent down and with his mind miserable gloomily
entered his father's house.



SARGA 72
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata does not find his father in the royal palace and goes to meet his mother. He
asks his mother about the whereabouts his father. Kaikeyi informs Bharata about the death of
Dasaratha. When Bharata enquired about Rama, Kaikeyi also discloses Rama's exile to the forest
along with Sita and Lakshmana. She also narrates about the two boons she asked the king Dasaratha
as well as how the king accepted her boons and sent Rama to exile. She further advises Bharata to
meet the chief of Brahmans like Vasista and others to get himself crowned for the kingdom.

Shlok 1: Not finding his father there in his father's palace, Bharata went to his mother's
apartment to see his mother.

Shlok 2: Beholding his son who was absent from home for long and returned, Kaikeyi was
delighted and then sprang up, leaving her golden seat to receive him.

Shlok 3: Soon after entering his house, which was devoid of any splendor, Bharata the
righteous man, grasped the auspicious feet of his mother in obeisance.

Shlok 4: Kaikeyi smelled (as mark of affection) the head of the illustrious Bharata, embraced
him, made him to ascend on her lap and started questions.

Shlok 5: "How many days passed since you have left your maternal grand father's house? Is
there no travel fatigue to you, who have come speedily in a chariot?"

Shlok 6: "O,son! Is your grand father doing well? Is Yudhajit, your maternal uncle doing
well? Were you happy in being absent from home ? Be good enough to tell me all?"

Shlok 7: Affectionately enquired thus by Kaikeyi, the lotus eyed bharata, the prince,
narrated all to his mother.

Shlok 8: "It is seventh day to me today since I left the grand father's house. Yudhajit, your
father as well as my maternal uncle are doing well"

Shlok 9: "Carrying the gifts and jewels, given to me by the king who annihilates enemies my
followers became tired on the way and I arrived ahead of them"

Shlok 10: "I came soon because of the horridness communicated by royal messengers. Let my
mother be good enough to tell that which I desire to ask her."

Shlok 11: "This couch of yours, which is fit for rest and decorated with gold, is empty. These
men and women of Ikshvaku race do not appear to me to be cheerful."

Shlok 12: "King Dasaratha mostly used to here in your house. Now, I am not seeing him. I came
here, desirous of seeing him."

Shlok 13: "O, mother! I will grasp in obeisance my father's feet. Tell about him, as I ask
you. Or is he in the house of Kausalya the senior most of my mothers?"

Shlok 14: Deluded by the greed for kingdom, Kaikeyi who knew everything closely, told the
terribly unpleasant news to Bharata, who did not know anything, as though the news was
delightful.

Shlok 15: "King Dasaratha, your father who was having a noble nature, who was respect and
performing frequent sacrifices as well as a refuge to good men followed that path which all beings
follow."

Shlok 16: Bharata, a righteous man with a noble descent and an honest man, hearing that news ,
immediately fell down on the ground, being exceedingly tormented by the grief for his father.

Shlok 17: The mighty armed and heroic Bharata, raising his grievous and depressed voice,
cried, "Alas, I am undone' and lifting up his arms, fell down.

Shlok 18: Then, Bharata of great majesty, who was enveloped in grief and whose mind was
troubled by reeling under the death of his father, lamented profusely.

Shlok 19: "These beautiful couch of my father earlier used to enhance its charm with his
splendor, as the moon irradiates the stainless sky in the night at the end of a rainy season."

Shlok 20: "Being unoccupied by my virtuous father, the same couch now is bereft of its glory,
like the sky without the moon or like the sea with its water dried up."

Shlok 21: Covering his lovely face with a raiment, Bharata the first of those who are
victorious, with a proffond distress in his mind shed tears in lamentation.

Shlok 22-23: Kaikeyi lifted up from the floor, her son Bharata, who was pained with sorrow,
looking like a god, who fell on the ground like a sala tree, cut off by an axe, appearing like an
elephant in rut, looking like the moon and sun,afflicted with grief as he was and spoke the
following words:

Shlok 24: "O, the highly illustrious prince! Arise,arise! Why are you lying down? Gentlemen,
like you, respected in the assembly of men, do not grieve indeed."

Shlok 25: "O, Bharata endowed with understanding! Your intellect, which follows good character
as well as sacred scriptures, has an authority to donate and sacrifice, ever shining as such like a
splendor in the abode of the sun.

Shlok 26: Encircled by numerous afflictions, Bharata weeping for a long time , rolled over the
floor and replied to his mother as follows:

Shlok 27: "Making up my mind that the king was either going to anoint Rama as a prince regent
or to perform a sacrifice, I cheerfully got into the journey."

Shlok 28: "All this turned to be otherwise. By not beholding my father, who was forever
interested in my wishes and welfare, my heart is broken to pieces"

Shlok 29: "O, mother! On what ailment did the king die, when I was not here? Rama and others
who performed purificatory rites by themselves for our father indeed fortunate."

Shlok 30: "It is sure that the illustrious monarch does not know the fact of my arrival.
Otherwise, my father quickly would have indeed smelled my head, by bending me in affection."

Shlok 31: "Where is the caressing hand of my dear father of unwearied action wipe away the
dust with which I am covered?"

Shlok 32: "Announce soon about my arrival to Rama of immortal exploits, he who is a wise
brother to me, my father, my friend and to whom Iam a servant."

Shlok 33: "An elder brother indeed becomes a father for a faithful man who knows
righteousness. I will grasp his feet in obeisance. He is indeed the refuge for me now."

Shlok 34: "What did my father the king, who know virtue , who was forever pious, who was true
to his promise, who was strictly truthful, who was truly valiant and who was honorable, say?"

Shlok 35: "I want to hear exactly the last message of my father to me." Thus requested by
Bharata, Kaikeyi spoke the following words in accordance with truth.

Shlok 36: That high soled king, who was excellent in understanding the Universal spirit,
departed to the world, crying ï¿½O, Rama, O, Sita, O, Lakshmana!'

Shlok 37: "Your father spoke the following last words also, when he was abandoned by the
operation of time , like a huge elephant surrendered into a trap."

Shlok 38: "Those men who are able to see Rama returning Sita and the mighty armed Lakshmana
are those who are fortunate enough"

Shlok 39: Hearing the aforesaid pronouncement, which disclosed second unpleasant news, Bharata
was dejected. Becoming gloomy faced, he once again asked his mother as follows:

Shlok 40: "Where did the virtuous Rama, who augments Kausalya' s delight go now along with my
brother Lakshmana and with Sita?"

Shlok 41: Asked by Bharata in this manner, his mother started telling so greatly unpleasant
words, exactly as it had happened, as though they were very pleasant words.

Shlok 42: "O, son! He, that prince Rama, wearing long narrow pieces of bark, went indeed to
the great forest of Dandaka, followed by Lakshmana and also sita."

Shlok 43: Hearing these words, Bharata being aware of the glory of his race, doubted and
fearedwhether Rama was sent to exile because of his unrighteous conduct, if any and again asked his
mother as follows:

Shlok 44: "Has not Rama indeed stolen the wealth of some Brahmana? Has not he done any harm
either to a rich or to a poor virtuous man?"

Shlok 45: "Has the prince indeed not longed for the wife of another? Why was my brother Rama
expelled to the forest of Dandaka?"

Shlok 46: Thereafter his mother, an unsteady woman, on account of her feminine nature began to
narrate her act which was the exact state of the case.

Shlok 47: Kaikeyi, a fool thing herself to be learned, after hearing the queries of the
virtuous Bharata, delightfully spoke the following words:

Shlok 48: "Not even a little of belonging to a Brahman was stolen by Rama,No harm was done by
him either to a rich or to a poor virtuous man. Rama does not even look with his eyes, the wives of
others."

Shlok 49: "O, son! Immediately on hearing decidedly about the coronation ceremony of Rama by
me then, I asked your father to bestow kingdom to you and for banishment of Rama to the forest"

Shlok 50: "Submitting to his own decree, King Dasaratha, your father has done all that was
requested by me. Rama along with Lakshmana and Sita too were sent into exile."

Shlok 51: "That beloved son having not been seen, the very celebrated monarch was made
miserable by the grief for his son and obtained death"

Shlok 52: "O, Bharata knowing righteousness! The king- ship may be taken charge by you now.
All this was indeed done for your sake in this manner by me."

Shlok 53: "O, son! Do not dwell in grief and anguish. Dwell in courage. This city along with
the salubrious kingdom indeed is subservient to you."

Shlok 54: "Hence, meet the chiefs of Brahmanas like Vasishta and others who know the rituals,
perform soon the sacred rites to the king and become crowned as a king yourself to the earth, being
not depressed in spirit.



SARGA 73

[Text] Bharata reproached Kaikeyi in many ways. Pricking with his unpleasant remarks,
Bharata tells her that he will bring back Rama from the forest, install him on the throne of
Ayodhya and become his attendant.

Shlok 1: Hearing that his father was dead and both his brothers were exiled; Bharata was
tormented with grief and spoke the following words:

Shlok 2: Bereft of my father as well as my brother too, who is exactly like my father, what
is the use of a kingdom now to me, lamenting as I am with despair?"

Shlok 3: "Making Dasaratha to die and turning Rama to be an ascetic, you brought one calamity
after another like sprinkling salt on a wound."

Shlok 4: "You came for destruction of our race, like the night of destruction coming at the
end of the world. My father could not be aware of his embracing a live char-coal to his bosom."

Shlok 5: "O, the malevolent woman! You caused the death of my father. O, the one who made our
race unchaste! In this race, happiness is deserted through your ignorance."

Shlok 6: "My father, king Dasaratha, who was true to his promise and immensely famous, now
died, tormented as he was with bitter grief, because of you."

Shlok 7: "Why did you kill my father the monarch, who was intent on righteousness? Why did
you send Rama on exile to the forest?"

Shlok 8: "It is impossible that Kausalya and Sumitra, who are afflicted with grief for their
sons, will live in fellowship with you, my mother."

Shlok 9: "Even Rama my elder brother, a pious man who knows how to behave with elders, used
to act with the best behavior in your case, exactly as how he was behaving with his own
mother."

Shlok 10: "In the same manner, Kausalya, my elder mother having far sightedness and
established in piety, indeed used to behave with you as your sister."

Shlok 11: "Why are you not lamenting, after sending Rama, the disciplined Kausalya 's son,
clothed in a bark dress, to live in a forest? O, sinful one!"

Shlok 12: "You indeed sent into exile, clad in a bark dress, Rama having a virtuous
disposition, a valiant man, a self controlled and illustrious man as he was. What reason do you
gather for it?"

Shlok 13: "I think it is not known to you, a greedy woman, about my devotion towards Rama. It
is exactly so. You have brought in this great calamity for the sake of a kingdom."

Shlok 14: "By which source of strength can I be able to protect the kingdom, without those
lions among men, Rama and Lakshmana in proximity to me?"

Shlok 15: "Dasaratha the monarch, having great strength and a pious mind always indeed used to
take refuge in that strong man Rama as the Meru mountain takes refuge in a forest surrounding the
mountain."

Shlok 16: "By what stamina, shall I sustain this burden of kingship any more than a young
bullock that is yet to be tamed, would stand the strain on getting a load, lifted up with ease by a
giant bullock."

Shlok 17: "Or even if a strength can be brought into existence in me by following certain
suitable methods or by strength of intelligence, I will not allow you, who are greedy in fetching
of kingdom for your son, to fulfill your desire."

Shlok 18: "No aversion would be felt by me even to desert you, a woman of evil designs, if
Rama did not treat you like a mother at all times."

Shlok 19: "O, malevolent woman with your good conduct disappeared! How this idea forbidden by
our ancestors, has arisen in your mind at all?"

Shlok 20: "The eldest of all in this race should be indeed anointed as a king. The rest of his
brothers are to behave reverently towards their elder brother."

Shlok 21: "O, cruel woman! I feel that you are not catching even a glimpse of the rules
relating to kings or not even aware of a permanent procedure prevailing in the administration of
kings."

Shlok 22: "According to the administration of kings the eldest son always indeed gets
inaugurated in kingdom. This procedure is similar to all kings; especially so in the case of
Ikshvaku kings."

Shlok 23: "The pride of reputation of those belonging to Ikshvaku race, who protect
righteousness alone and who possessed good family conduct, is turned away by you today."

Shlok 24: "Even kings belonging to your ancestral race were great people. How has this
contemptible stupidity of mind born in you?"

Shlok 25: "O, woman with evil designs! I for one will not fulfill your desire. A criminal act,
which will cause even an end to my life, has been undertaken by you."

Shlok 26: "Now itself at the cause of your dislike, I for one will bring back from the forest,
my brother, who is a faultless man and a beloved man of his people."

Shlok 27: "Bringing back Rama with a very firm mind, I will become a servant to him, who is
radiant with glory."

Shlok 28: Speaking as aforesaid, the high soled Bharata, pricking her with a multitude of
unpleasant words, roared again like a lion stationed in a mountain cave.



SARGA 74
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata censures Kaikeyi saying that because of her, Dasaratha is dead and Rama is
sent to exile. He abuses his mother of her greed for the kingdom and the misfortune thus brought to
Kausalya, Sumitra and other mothers because of his father's death and brother's exile to the
forest. He compares the grief of the Kausalya with the grief of Kamadhenu the mythical cow who was
aggrieved of a pair of bullocks (her sons) being harassed by a plough -man. Bharata then promises
that he would bring Rama back to Ayodhya and make him as a king.

Shlok 1: Reproaching Kaikeyi in that manner, Bharata again spoke the following words, wrapped
as he was in great anger.

Shlok 2: "O, Kaikeyi! The cruel and evil-mannered woman! Get lost from this kingdom. You
having abandoned righteousness, remain lamenting about me, who will be dead soon."

Shlok 3: "What harm king Dasaratha or the highly righteous Rama have done to you so harshly
that Dasaratha's death and Rama's exile have occurred at one and the same time because of you?"

Shlok 4: "O, Kaikeyi! You got the sin of killing an embryo because of the destruction of this
race. O, Kaikeyi! Go to hell .Do not get the residence in the same heaven as your husband."

Shlok 5: "You have done this terrific act and committed such a great sin. By forsaking the
persons beloved by all, an alarm has been created in me also."

Shlok 6: "My father died and Rama is dwelling in a forest, because of you. You got me ill
fame in this world of beings."

Shlok 7: "Though in appearance you are my mother, you are inimical to me. You are a cruel
woman, greedy of kingdom. With evil conduct, you killed your husband. I should never speak to
you."

Shlok 8: "Kausalya, Sumitra and my other mothers are engrossed in a great misfortune, by
falling victim to you, who brought disgrace to our family."

Shlok 9- 10: "The righteous Rama, who is forever devoted to truth, was sent to the forest. Due to
grief for his son, my father went to heaven. You do not seem to be the daughter of Asvapati, the
pious and sensible king. You were born there as a demo ness, to destroy the house of my
father."

Shlok 11: "The aforesaid sin you have committed has made me father less. Besides, I have been
abandoned by my brothers and all the people dislike me now."

Shlok 12: "O, woman having evil desires, moving towards hell! Which world will you attain now,
after making Kausalya endowed with righteousness, deprived of her son?"

Shlok 13: "O, cruel woman! Don't you know that Rama the son of Kausalya is a subdued man, who
is devoted to his relatives and as an eldest brother, equal to a father?"

Shlok 14: "A son is the most beloved to his mother as he is born from the primary and
secondary limbs of her body and also from her heart. The other relatives are only like
friends."

Shlok 15: "Once upon a time, Kamadhenu the mythical cow of Vasista, who knew righteousness and
was worshipped by celestials, is said to have seen her sons, drawing a heavy burden on earth and
became unconscious."

Shlok 16: "Seeing her sons (a pair of bullocks) fatigued, after toiling for half a part of
their day on earth, Kamadhenu the mythical cow cried with her eyes full of tears in grief for the
fate of her sons."

Shlok 17: "Small and sweet smelling tear drops of that mythical cow fell on the limbs of the
high soled Indra the lord of celestials, who was traveling below in a lower region."

Shlok 18: "Seeing those sweet- scented tears falling on his limbs, Indra the Lord of
celestials identified the tears to be those of the great Kamadhenu the mythical cow."

Shlok 19: "Looking into the sky, Indra saw that Kamadhenu standing there with anguish and
pitiably weeping with great grief."

Shlok 20: "Indra the lord of celestials with a thunder bolt in his hand, seeing that beautiful
Kamadhenu the mythical cow, tormented with grief, spoke eagerly with joined palms to her, as
follows:

Shlok 21: "O, cow the well wisher of all! I hope there is no great panic from any quarter to
us. For what occasion is your sorrow?"

Shlok 22: "Hearing the words of the intelligent Indra the god of celestials, the prudent
Kamadhenu who was skilled in expressing words, replied as follows:

Shlok 23: "Heaven forefend that evil! O, Indra the lord of celestials! There is no danger
whatsoever to you from any quarter. Seeing these pair of bullocks, my sons, who are in hardship,
being scorched by sun's rays, becoming weak, being troubled by the man who ploughs the land and
being immersed in grief, I am pitiably weeping O, Indra!"

Shlok 25: "By seeing them who are afflicted with the burden and aggrieved, I am greatly
anguished. They are indeed born of my body. There is no dearest one equal to a son indeed!"

Shlok 26: Seeing such a sacred cow weeping, whose hundreds of sons pervaded the entire world,
Indra reckoned none whosoever as more than a son (to a mother) .

Shlok 27: "Such a Kamadhenu the sacred cow, which is desirous of maintaining the world always
having unequalled behavior, the venerable one, by its very nature functioning forever with good
qualities and to whom there are thousands of sons, is lamenting, how much more indeed Kausalya will
drag her existence, without Rama?"

Shlok 29: "She, who has only one son and who is a holy woman, has been made without a child by
you. Thereafter, you will obtain grief forever after your death or even here while living."

Shlok 30: "I for my part, shall toil for the complete reinstatement of my brother and complete
the obsequial rites due to my father as well as for their prosperity and glory. There is no
doubt."

Shlok 31: "Rama the son of Kausalya, of great prowess will be brought back to Ayodhya and I,
myself will go to the forest inhabited by the sages."

Shlok 32: "O, wretched and evil minded woman! By seeing the sorrow stricken citizens, I am
indeed not able to bear the inequity done by you."

Shlok 33: "As for you, enter the fire or you yourself go to forest of Dandaka.or fasten a rope
around your neck. There is no other recourse for you."

Shlok 34: "After Rama the truly mighty man, obtains his native land, I will even become an
accomplished man, with my sins duly washed away."

Shlok 35: As an elephant in a forest pricked with a javelin and a goad and as a hissing
serpent, Bharata was enraged and fell on the ground.

Shlok 36: His eyes inflamed, his clothes in disarray, and his all ornaments discarded, Bharata
the prince and the tormentor of foes, lay on the earth, like a banner of Indra raised at the end of
a ceremony**



SARGA 75
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata asserts that he does not know how the exile of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana has
occurred. Bharata and Satrughna go to Kausalya's place. Kausalya speaks harsh words to Bharata,
saying that Kaikeyi his mother procured for him the kingdom as desired by him the kingdom as
desired by him. Bharata politely explains, on a number of oaths, his own innocence over the matter,
Kausalya comes to know Bharata's heart, fondly takes him to her lap and weeps distressfully.

Shlok 1: That valiant Bharata, having come to himself a long time on obtaining consciousness,
saw his mother whose eyes were filled pitiably with tears, reproached her mother in the midst of
the ministers and said as follows:-

Shlok 2-3: "I never desired for the kingdom nor consulted about this matter with even my
mother. I was not aware of the proposed coronation, which has of the been contemplated by king
Dasaratha; since I was staying indeed in a distant land, along with Satrughna."

Shlok 4: "I was neither aware of the banishment of Rama to the forest nor about how the exile
of Lakshmana and Seetha have occurred."

Shlok 5: Recognising the voice of Bharata the noble man, crying out in that manner, Kausalya
spoke the following words to Sumitra:

Shlok 6: "Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, the doer terrific deeds arrived. I went to see that
far-sighted Bharata."

Shlok 7: That kausalya who became pale with her demeanor, dirty and emaciated, speaking to
Sumitra as aforesaid, became agitated and absent minded and proceeded to Bharata's place.

Shlok 8: Bharata, the younger brother of Rama on his part, along with Shatrughna started out
to Kausalya's place.

Shlok 9: Seeing Kausalya who was afflicted with grief, who fell unconscious (on the way) who
was crying and who was an honorable woman with a noble mind. Shatrughna and Bharata wept in sorrow,
approached her painfully and embraced her.

Shlok 10- 11: Kausalya who was very much in sorrow , spoke the following words to Bharata: "you,
who have a desire for kingdom, have got this invincible kingdom ."Alas! By the cruel deed of
Kaikeyi, it was obtained by you soon!"

Shlok 12: "The ruthless Kaikeyi condemned my son to wear garments of bark and sent him to
dwell in the forest: What merit has she gained from this?"

Shlok 13: "Kaikeyi ought to send me too without delay to the place where my illustrious son
with a golden novel (the distinguished mark of Vishnu the god of creation) is there."

Shlok 14: "Otherwise, I for my own satisfaction accompanied by Sumitra, placing in
front(carried by Brahmana) the sacred fire*** will happily set out to the place Raghava has
gone."

Shlok 15: "Otherwise, you yourself ought to conduct me now, if you so desire, to the place
where my son, the tiger among men, is living as an ascetic."

Shlok 16: "This vast kingdom, endowed with elephants, horses and chariots and stock piled with
grains and riches, has been made over to you by her."

Shlok 17: Derided with these and other harsh words that he had not merited, Bharata was
extremely perturbed, as if a needle was thrust into an open wound.

Shlok 18: His mind being perplexed and having lost his consciousness, Bharata then coming his
senses, wailed in many ways and fell at the feet of the queen.

Shlok 19: Then, Bharata with folded hands, replied as follows to Kausalya who was encircled by
afflictions and weeping as aforesaid in many ways:

Shlok 20: "O, noble woman! Why do you reproach me, sinless as I am, for those things that I do
not know anything? Nay, you know well of the greatest affection I have for Rama."

Shlok 21: "May the mind of the one who in any way whatsoever allowed for the departure of my
elder brother the best of men who keeps up his promise, be closed to all the seriptures."

Shlok 22: "May he who counseled the banishment of my noble brother become the slave of the
vilest scoundrels, may he answer the calls of nature in the face of the sun and may he kick with
his foot, a sleeping cow."

Shlok 23: "With whose counsel my elder brother went to exile, to him let that sin incur, as to
a master who imposes the heaviest labour on his servant without remunerating him."

Shlok 24: "with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, to him let that sin incur as
to those who seek to harm a king who protects his people as if they are his own children."

Shlok 25: "May the guilt of a king, who taking the sixth part of the revenue of his people
fails to protect them, be fallen on them with whose counsel my elder brother went to exile."

Shlok 26: "May the sin of those having given the promise for certain sacrificial fees to
priests in a sacrifice, breaks that promise, to be his with whose counsel my elder brother went to
exile."

Shlok 27: "May the sin of him, who fails to observe the code of warfare followed by the
virtuous in a battle abundantly provided with elephants horses chariots weapons and men, be his
with whose counsel my elder brother went to exile."

Shlok 28: "May that perverse wretch, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile,
forget the subtle meanings of the scriptures taught with care by a wise teacher."

Shlok 29: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, never behold that
Rama having large arms and broad shoulders radiant as the sun and the moon and seated as he will be
on a throne."

Shlok 30: "May that pitiless one with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur
the sin of partaking milk boiled with rice and sugar a cooked mixture of rice and peas with a few
species and a goat flesh without offering them to the gods and be lacking in reverence towards
teachers."

Shlok 31: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sins of
kicking the cows, of personally abusing the elders and of deceiving a friend too much."

Shlok 32: "May that perverse wretch with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile
incur the sin of divulging a little abusing words about others spoken occasionally in secret and in
confidence, to him."

Shlok 33: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, become a non doer, an
ungrateful person; a desperate man, the one who has abandoned shame and the one who is worthy of
hate."

Shlok 34: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur the sin of
eating delicious food for himself alone when he is surrounded by his sons , wife and servants in
his house."

Shlok 35: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has departed; die issueless, failing to
secure a wife suitable for him and thus not fulfilling his religious duties."

Shlok 36: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has departed, not see a child through
his wife and in distress, may not get a full long life."

Shlok 37: "That sin which was proclaimed in killing a king a woman, a child or an aged person
or in abandoning one's dependents let him (with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile)
obtain the same sin."

Shlok 38: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, obtain, tat= the sin
of nurturing his wife children and other dependents through sale of lacquer, liquor, flesh, iron or
poison."

Shlok 39: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, obtain the sin of
being killed while fleeing, at a time when a battle inspiring fear upon enemy's side has
commanded."

Shlok 40: May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, wander about the
world, as a mad man with a wooden bowl in his hand, dressed in rags and begging for alms."

Shlok 41: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has departed, be given over to
infatuation and anger and be constantly involved in wine women and dice."

Shlok 42: May the mind of man with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, never
take delight in righteousness? Let him indulge in un righteousness and become a distributor of
gifts for the undeserving."

Shlok 43: "With whose counsel , my elder brother has gone to exile, let his various kinds of
riches got accumulated in thousands , be snatched away by robbers."

Shlok 44: "That sin which was proclaimed on him who sleeps during both the twilights, let that
sin be obtained by him, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile."

Shlok 45: "Let him obtains that sin, which attaches to a man who practices arson, to a man who
violets his teacher's bed and to a man who cheats his friend."

Shlok 46: "May he, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, incur that sin of
not doing service to be god, to the manes and likewise to his mother and father."

Shlok 47: "May he with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, forfeit soon and now
from the region obtained by virtuous man, forfeit the illustriousness enjoyed by good men and the
righteous actions."

Shlok 48: "May he with whose counsel, that long armed and broad chested elder brother has gone

milking a cow having a young calf. " (of age less than ten days)

Shlok 57: "To him, with whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, let that sin be
obtained of disappointing a person oppressed with thirst, even though water was available."

Shlok 58: "With whose counsel my elder brother has gone to exile, let the sin be accorded to
him, who while standing on the road, merely witnesses a dispute between two divided groups without
trying to make peace between them."

Shlok 59: "While thus counseling Kausalya, who was bereft of her husband and son, the prince
Bharata fell down, depressed as he was with anguish."

Shlok 60: Kausalya spoke the following words to Bharata who was tormented with grief, was
quite distraught and who just uttered formidable imprecations in the aforesaid manner:

Shlok 61: "O, son! My grief is further enhanced. By uttering the curses, you are indeed
racking my spirits."

Shlok 62: "O ,son! Fortunately, your mind as it is endowed with nobility, has not swerved from
righteous path. You will obtain the world of the blessed, along with Lakshmana."

Shlok 63: Thus speaking to Bharata who was devoted to his brother Rama, she took the valiant
Bharata to her lap, embraced him and wept aloud , as she was very much afflicted with grief.

Shlok 64: Lamenting thus, the great soled Bharata distraught on account of grief, felt himself
about to swoon, with his mind crushed by the burden of grief.

Shlok 65: To Bharata that night passed with grief in lamenting thus laying fallen unconscious
on the ground, sighing warmly again and again with his power of discernment having been lost.



SARGA 76
------------------------------

[Text] Vasistha advises Bharata to stop lamenting and to perform the last rites of the
king. Bharata then places the body of Dasaratha on a couch, taking it out from the vessel where it
had been immersed in oil and proceeds with the funeral rites. The appointed priests, attendants,
people of the city and the weeping royal women followed the funeral pile of the king to the banks
of Sarayu River where the body was cremated. Bharata along with others return to the city after the
completion of the cremation-ceremony.

Shlok 1: The sage Vasishta, the excellent one among the speakers having eloquence, spoke to
that Bharata, Kaikeyi's son who was thus tormented with grief.

Shlok 2: "O, the greatly illustrious prince! My blessing to you. You have lamented long
enough. Perform in an excellent way, the last rites of the king."

Shlok 3: Hearing the words of Vasishta, Bharata conversant with his duty fell prostate and
proceeded with all the arrangements for the obsequies.

Shlok 4- 5: Raising the body of king Dasaratha, from the vessel where it had been immersed in
oil, seeming as it were asleep with face in the color of gold, that son Bharata placed it in a
magnificent couch, adorned with every kind of precious stone and in a great grief, lamented.(as
follows):

Shlok 6: "O, king! Having sent into exile the virtuous Rama and Lakshmana who is possessed of
great strength, while I was away from home and had not yet returned, what did you intend to
do?"

Shlok 7: "Where will you go, leaving this person (me) who was distressed and bereft of Rama
the unwearied one in action and the excellent one among men?"

Shlok 8: "O, king! O, father! Who is supposed to see the welfare and security of your city of
Ayodhya, while you have departed for heaven and while Rama has gone, taking refuge in a
forest?"

Shlok 9: "O, king! Bereft of you and deprived of its lord, this earth does not look charming.
To me, this city is looking like a night without a moon."

Shlok 10: The great sage Vasishta again spoke the following words to that Bharata who was
distressed in mind and thus lamenting.

Shlok 11: "O, mighty armed Bharata! Without hesitation or repining, carry out the funeral
rites of the king that should be done."

Shlok 12: "Be it so" answered Bharata and obedient to Vasishta's command, he summoned speedily
the appointed priests who were knowing the rules of the funeral rites."

Shlok 13: The fires of that king were prepared outside the chamber and kindled in accordance
with the rituals by the priests and the sacrificial attendants.

Shlok 14: The attendants were choked with tears in their throats and disconsolate in their
mind, made the dead king to mount on a small palanquin and carried it away.

Shlok 15: The people went along the path, scattering silver, gold and various kinds of clothes
in front of the king.

Shlok 16: In the same manner, some others brought sandal wood, sweet aloes, different fragrant
essences, with leaps of Sarala Padmaka and Devadaru woods and many other kinds of fragrant
substances, went there and threw them into the funeral pile. Thereafter the appointed priests
caused the king's body to lie down there in the midst of the funeral pyre.

Shlok 18: Then, those priests engaged for the benefit of the king poured oblations into the
fire and recited sacred texts (relevant to the funeral rites). Those among the priests, who could
recite the hymns of Samaveda, chanted them according to the rules.

Shlok 19: Then, his ladies, encircled by elders mounted palanquins or other vehicles, as
deserving and departed from the city to that place.

Shlok 20: Then, the appointed priests as well as Kausalya and other women who were tormented
with grief, circumambulated in anti clockwise direction that king who was lying on a funeral
pile.

Shlok 21: At that time the crying sounds of thousands of women, pitiably weeping with agony,
were heard like the sounds of female curlew birds.

Shlok 22: Thereafter, the lamenting ladies deprived of their grit wept again and again and
descended from their vehicles at the bank of Sarayu River.

Shlok 23: Along with Bharata, the royal women, the ministers and family priests offered their
oblations with water and entered the city with their eyes filled in tears and spent ten days with
great difficulty by sleeping on bare floor.

[Text] On the twelfth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata gives various presents to
Brahmans. On the thirteenth day when Bharata and Shatrughna go to the cremation ground to collect
the bones both of them are overwhelmed with grief and fall down on the ground. Vasista, the family
priest and Sumantra raise them up and pacifying urge both of them to complete the remaining rites
to be performed on the thirteenth day.

Shlok 1: After having passed the tenth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata having himself
purified, performed Shraddha* rites on the arrival of the twelfth day.

[Commentary] * Shraddha rites are in the honor and for the benefit of dead relatives observed
with great strictness at various fixed periods and on the occasion of rejoicing as well as mourning
by the surviving relatives. These are performed by the daily offering of water and on the stated
occasion by the offering of Pindas or balls of rice and meal to three paternal forefathers i.e.
Father, grandfather, and great grandfather. It is an act of reverential homage to a deceased person
performed by relatives, most desirably by a son of the deceased.

Shlok 2: On the occasion of Shraddha rites, Bharata gave precious stones, money, a lot of
cooked rice, very valuable clothes and various other kinds of presents to Brahmans.

Shlok 3: In that ceremony performed in honor of the dead king, Bharata the son of Dasaratha
gave multitudes of white goats, hundreds of cows, servants and servant maids, vehicles and very big
houses to Brahmans.

Shlok 4- 5: Then, at the time of dawn on the thirteenth day, the mighty armed Bharata who came
for clearing up bones and ashes, wept in grief, his throat being choked of sound (because of
crying) and spoke in great distress the following words, having reached the foot of his father's
funeral pile (to collect the bones and ashes for their immersion in Sarayu River).

Shlok 6: "O, father! My brother Rama to whose care I was entrusted by you, having gone on
exile to the forest, I now become abandoned wholly alone, by you."

Shlok 7: "O, king! O, father! Where have you gone, leaving Kausalya the mother whose son
Rama, her support, has been sent away from home to the forest?"

Shlok 8: Seeing that spot of collection (of bones), which became reddish brown in colour
because of ashes, with bones consumed by fire and his father's body having extinguished, Bharata
was depressed and began to cry loudly.

Shlok 9: Miserable as he was to see the spot, Bharata fell weeping on the ground, as a flag
staff fastened by any mechanical contrivance would drop down while being raised in honor of Indra
the god of celestials.

Shlok 10: All his ministers hastily approached Bharata who was virtuous in conduct, as sages
once rushed to the fallen Yayati at the time of his death.

Shlok 11: Seeing Bharata, Shatrughna was also overwhelmed with grief and while recollecting
the king, fell unconscious on the ground.

Shlok 12: Remembering the many gestures of his father resulting from his loving qualities made
from time to time, Shatrughna was lamenting (as follows) like one who has lost his wits, bewildered
as he was.

Shlok 13: "We are immersed in a violent and appalling ocean of sorrow invoked by Mandhara, in
which Kaikeyi in the form of a crocodile swam in its current the irrevocable boons granted to her
by my father."

Shlok 14: "O, father! Where have you gone leaving the lamenting Bharata, your boy always being
caressed by you."

Shlok 15: "You used to fulfill the wishes of all of us, in the matter of eatables, drinks,
clothes, and jewels. Who else will do it (now) for us."

Shlok 16: "That earth which is deprived of you, the high soled and righteous king, is not
riven even when it is the time to be riven."

Shlok 17: "The father having obtained heaven and Rama having taken refuge in a forest, what is
the significance of life for me? I shall enter a fire."

Shlok 18: "Bereft of my brother and father, I can not return to the deserted city of Ayodhya,
where Ikshvaku used to reign. I shall retire to a hermitage."

Shlok 19: Hearing the lamentation of both of them and beholding their plight, all their
companions were disturbed very much, once again.

Shlok 20: Both Shatrughna, and Bharata were wearied with grief and began to roll on the
ground, like two bulls whose horns have been broken.

Shlok 21: Then, Vasista, a noble man, a learned man and the family priest of their father,
raised up that Bharata from the ground and spoke the following words:

Shlok 22: "O, Lord Bharata! This is the thirteenth day of the death of your father. Why are
you hanging down here, when the ceremony of collecting the bones is still unfinished?"

Shlok 23: "The three pairs of opposites (namely hunger and thirst, joy and sorrow; birth and
death) occur to all living beings without any distinction. They being inevitable, you ought not to
behave like this."

Shlok 24: Even Sumantra, who knew the Truth, raising up Shatrughna and pacifying him, told him
about the origin and dissolution of all beings.

Shlok 25: The two illustrious tigers among men (Bharata and Satrughna) who had got up,
appeared like two banners severally raised in honor of Indra (the god of celestials) soiled through
rain and the sun.

Shlok 26: The ministers hurried up the princes, who were wiping their tears and who were
talking pitiably with their eyes reddened (due to excessive weeping) to expedite the other rites
pertaining to the thirteenth day.

[Text] Shatrughna asks Bharata why even Lakshmana could not prevent Dasaratha from sending
Rama to the forest. Meanwhile, when Manthara arrives at the scen, Shatrughna seizes her with his
powerful hand, threatens to punish her and abuses Kaikeyi too. When Kaikeyi pleads for mercy with
her son, Bharata intervenses and Shatrughna releases Manthara.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana spoke the following words to
Bharata, who was tormented with grief and who desired to undertake an expedition to Rama.

Shlok 2: "When that even-minded Rama is a refuge for all beings, how much more to tell about
our seeking solace to him in our grief? He has been abandoned to the forest by a woman."

Shlok 3: "Why the so-called Lakshmana, the strong and powerful man, even could not rescue
Rama from distress by making our father to restrain from doing it?"

Shlok 4: "By perceiving the prudence and imprudence in that wrong course adopted by the king,
who has fallen into the clutches of a woman, Lakshmana should have restrained Dasaratha even at the
beginning itself."

Shlok 5: While Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana was talking thus, the hump-backed
Manthara duly adorned with all types of ornaments, appeared at the eastern gate.

Shlok 6: Anointed with a scent of sandal-wood and wearing royal clothes, she was bedecked
with several kinds of ornaments of every description in various ways.

Shlok 7: Studded with bright-coloured girdle-bands and many other excellent ornaments,
Manthara appeared like a female-monkey tied with ropes!

Shlok 8: Beholding that hump-backed Manthara, the very much sinful and insensitive woman, the
door-keepers caught her and delivered her to Shatrughna (with the following words:)

Shlok 9: "Here is that sinful and cruel woman, by whose act Rama is in the forest and your
father has laid down his body. Do with her, as you consider fitting."

Shlok 10: Hearing those words, Shatrughna who was very much in grief and was firmly resolute,
spoke to all those inmates of that gynaecium, as follows:

Shlok 11: "Let this woman, who created serious misfortune to my brothers and my father,
receive the fruit of her cruel act."

Shlok 12: Speaking thus in the midst of her companions, he seized that hunch-backed woman with
his powerful hand soon and she in turn made that mansion resound with her shrieks.

Shlok 13: Then, her companion, having conceived Shatrughna's anger and extremely agonised as
they were, ran away helter-shelter in all directions.

Shlok 14: All the company of women there surmised as follows : "The way how he is coming up,
he will surely slay us all"

Shlok 15: "We shall take reguge with the compassionate, magnanimous, virtuous and illustrious
Kausalya. Let her be the sure asylum for us."

Shlok 16: That Shatrughna, the tormentor of enemies, with his raging red eyes then violently
dragged the crying hump-back along the floor.

Shlok 17: While that Manthara was violently dragged, here various colourful ornaments were
scattered asunder here and there on the floor.

Shlok 18: Thus, that splendid royal mansion scattered by those ornaments, appeared very much
like an autumnal sky studded with innumerable stars.

Shlok 19: Shatrughna, the strong and the eminent man, thus violently seizing her with rage,
sharply rebuked Kaikeyi and spoke harsh words to her.

Shlok 20: Agonised very much by those harsh and painful words, Kiakeyi overwhelmed as she was
with the fear of Shatrughna, took refuge with Bharata.

Shlok 21: Seeing that enraged Shatrughna, Bharata said: "Among all beings women are not to be
killed. Hence she is to be pardoned."

Shlok 22: "If the pious Rama were not to express his displeasure with me for killing the
mother, I would have killed this Kaikeyi, the ill-mannered and sinful woman."

Shlok 23: "If the virtuous Rama hears that the hunch-backed woman has been killed, it is sure
that he will cease to talk to you or even to me."

Shlok 24: Hearing the words of Bharata, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana renouncing
his guilty design forthwith released that Manthara.



Manthara fell at the feet of Kaikeyi, breathless, weeping piteously.

Shlok 26: Seeing the hunch-backed woman, who was distraught on account of shatrughna's
violence, wearing a disturbed appearance and looking like a crane that has been caught in a noose,
Bharata's mother slowly consoled her.



SARGA 79
------------------------------

[Text] The king-makers request Bharata to take over Ayodhya kingdom. Bharata refuses to do
so and promises to bring back Rama to Ayodhya and make him only as the king. Bharata further orders
for construction of a path-way to reach the forest.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, early in the morning on the fourteenth day, the king-makers coming
together, spoke to Bharata the following words.

Shlok 2: "Dasaratha, who was our highly venerable master, went to heaven after sending his
elder son Rama and the exceedingly strong Lakshmana to forest."

Shlok 3: "O, the highly illustrious prince! From now on, do you be our king. Fortunately,
this kingdom has not yet missed the mark, even without a king."

Shlok 4: "O, prince Bharata! Taking all the things needed for coronation, your own people
(the counsellers and the ministers) as well as the citizens are awaiting for you."

Shlok 5: "O, Bharata the excellent among men! Take over the stable kingdom, which came in
succession from your ancestors, coronate yourself and rule us."

Shlok 6: The firmly resolute Bharata performed circumambulation clockwise around all the
things kept ready for consecration and replied to all those people as follows:

Shlok 7: "It is indeed appropriate to bestow kingship always to the eldest of our clan. You,
being the conversant people, ought not to tell in this manner to me."

Shlok 8: "Our eldest brother, Rama will become the king. I then will reside in the forest for
fourteen years."

Shlok 9: "Let a great and exceptionally powerful army consisting of all the four limbs be
kept ready. I shall bring Rama our elder brother from the forest."

Shlok 10: "Keeping in front, all the assembled requisites needed for consecration, I shall
proceed to the forest for the sake of bringing back Rama."

Shlok 11: "Consecrating him, the tiger among men there itself, I shall surely bring Rama
solemnized in front, as bringing home the sacred fire from a sacrificial rite, after performing it
outside the city."

Shlok 12: "I shall not make her, my so-called mother, fulfil her desire. I will reside in the
impassable forest. Rama will become the king."

Shlok 13: "Let a path-way be prepared by those skilled in that profession, by leveling the
uneven surfaces. Let guards who can easily move in the inaccessible forests accompany us in the
path."

Shlok 14: Hearing Prince Bharata, talking in consideration of Rama's cause, all the people
replied in the following illustrious and excellent words:

Shlok 15: "Let the gracious goddess of prosperity abide with you, who are speaking thus,
desirous of giving kingdom to Rama the eldest son of the king."

Shlok 16: Hearing those excellent words spoken by the prince close to their ears, tears born
of joy fell from the face and eyes of those venerable men.

Shlok 17: Hearing these words, the people there along with council and the ministers felt
cheerful, being relieved of their anxiety and spoke the following words : "As per your command,
devoted men and a group of artisans have been instructed to make the path-way."



SARGA 80
------------------------------

[Text] The engineers construct a comfortably high-way from Ayodhya to the River Ganga, by
clearing off shrubs and stones on the way and excellent wells were dug. Beautiful tents were also
built on the path.

Shlok 1- 2- 3: Then, those able to advise on the nature of soils, those skilled in thread-holding
for leveling purposes, those who were energetic courageous and attentive in doing their jobs,
excavators, mechanics, labourers, carpenters, road-menders, wood-cutters, hollow-makers, men
skilled in plastering and white washing, basket makers, tanners and skilled supervisors of work
sallied forth in advance.

Shlok 4: That mighty assembly of men gladly setting out to that forest was splendid like an
ocean on the day of the full moon having a gigantic commotion.

Shlok 5: Men skilled in making roads, furnished with tools of every kin, seeking the company
of men of their own proper place, marched ahead.

Shlok 6: Clearing away rows of creepers and shrubs timber and big rocks as well as variours
kinds of trees (which obstructed the way), they carved out a path.

Shlok 7: Some men planted trees in tree-less areas. Some others chopped the existing trees
here and there by means of axes, hatchets and sickles.

Shlok 8: Some other strong men removed sturdy tufts of Virana grass and leveled the uneven
places here and there.

Shlok 9: Some others filled up wells and extensive pits with earth. Some men leveled
low-lying places all around.

Shlok 10: Then, some men bridged the steams that could be bridged, pulverised the rocks that
could be pulverised and smashed (the impediments that blocked the flow of water) those which could
be smashed.

Shlok 11: Many ponds, in various sizes and shapes containing plenty of water resembling seas
were built (by constructing dams on rivulets).

Shlok 12: In water-scarce areas, excellent wells in various shapes were dug duly decorated all
around with platforms (to rest).

Shlok 13- 14: That track of the troops, having its surface inlaid with cement, with flowering
trees inlaid with cement, with flowering trees on both sides, inhabited with birds in excitement
making their sounds, adorned with flags on its either side with its surface sprinkled with water of
sandal-wood fragrance, and decorated with various kinds of flowers, looked very much splendid like
the path of celestials.

Shlok 15- 16: Those officers appointed for execution of the work, as ordered by Bharata,
skillfully instructed their work-men and erected a tent which was intended for the great-souled
Bharata, in a beautiful place abundant with tasty fruits. They further adorned profusely with
decorations, the tent which itself resembled on ornament.

Shlok 17: The connoisseurs erected the tents of the high-souled Bharata at auspicious hours in
days when the stars were propitious.

Shlok 18- 19- 20: Those camps, with many breast works of sand, moats surrounding each of them, streets
as resplendent as sapphires, their crowns of terrets, the ramparts covered with stucco to protect
then, the splendid banners, the skillfully laidout avenues, lofty mansions the tops of which were
provided with dove-cots, which flew about as it were in the air and in splendour, resembled the
capitals of Indra.

Shlok 21: The route thus prepared, extended upto the Ganga River, whose pure and limpid
waters, abounding in great fish, flowed between woods and forests of every kind.

Shlok 22: That beautiful royal high way, which was built gradually by efficient engineers,
appeared as resplendent as a night in a clear sky, illumined by the moon with its procession of
stars.



SARGA 81
------------------------------

[Text] When Bharata hear the sound of couches and drums early in the morning, he gets more
depressed. He orders for stopping of those sounds and starts lamenting. Then, Vasishta the
family-priest enters the assembly-hall and sends messengers, asking them to call Bharata urging him
to be present in the court, and in response to his call, Bharata with Shatrughna, the ministers and
others enter the assembly.

Shlok 1: Then, bards and pangegyrists, who knew the importance of tidings, eulogized Bharata
with auspicious hymns of praise on the night preceding Naandimukha.

[Commentary] Naandimukha: The name of a ceremony in honour and for the benefit of dead
relatives observed on a festive occasion to secure their blessings.

Shlok 2: A drum from the sound of which nigh-hours are identified, struck with a golden
stick, gave its sound. Couches and loud-sounding instruments in hundreds producing various types of
noises were blown.

Shlok 3: That mammoth sound of the musical instruments, as if filling up the whole sky,
created further distress and grief to Bharata who was already tormented with grief.

Shlok 4: Then, the awakened Bharata proclaiming that "I am not the king", caused to stop that
sound and spoke the following words to shatrughna:

Shlok 5: "Behold, O, Shatrughna! How much harm was done to the world by Kaikeyi! The king
Dasartha left us, leaving all sorrows to me."

Shlok 6: "This prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya, a foundation of law and religion of that
high-souled Dasaratha the righteous king is now like boat without a rudder moving hitter and
thither in water.

Shlok 7: "Even that Rama, who was a great protector has been sent to the forest by this very
mother of mine, abandoning her righteousness."

Shlok 8: Seeing Bharata who lost his consciousness by lamenting in that way, all the women
then miserably cried in one voice.

Shlok 9: While Bharata was lamenting thus, the great illustrious Vasishta who knew the rules
relating to kings, entered the assembly-hall of Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku dynasty.

Shlok 10: The pious minded Vasishta along with his attendants entered that lovely
assembly-hall, made of gold and studded with gems and jewels, resembling Sudharma the celestial
assembly-hall.

Shlok 11: Vasista, who knew all the scriptures, then sat in a presidential chair made of gold
and wrapped with a comfortable cushion. He ordered the messengers as follows:

Shlok 12: "Quickly bring Brahmanas (a class of people having divine knowledge), Kshatriyas
(people belonging to warrior-class), Vaisyas (agriculturists and traders), ministers and troop
commanders coolly. There is an urgent duty indeed for us to be done.

Shlok 13: "Bring Shatrughna with his royal attendants, the illustrious Bharata, Yudhaajit
(Bharata's maternal uncle) Sumantra the charioteer and those people who are royal well-wishers
there."

Shlok 14: There was a huge hallooing sound generated while the people invited were coming on
chariots, horses and elephants.

Shlok 15: People of high position like ministers and other welcomed the approaching Bharata in
every way as they had welcomed Dasaratha and as Indra was welcomed by celestials.

Shlok 16: That royal assembly, made splendid by Bharata the son of Dasartha, radiated as
before as with the presence of Dasaratha, like a lake of tranquil waters sown with pearls shells
and sand and filled with great fish and serpents.



SARGA 82
------------------------------

[Text] Vasishta requests Bharata to get himself anointed as a king. Bharata refuses to rob
the throne from Rama. Who is really elighible for it as the eldest son of the family. He resolves
to bring back Rama from the forest and orders Sumantra to arrange for vehicles and men for the
journey. Thereupon, warriors merchants Shudras and Bhrahmanas harnessed their chariots and got
ready for the journey to the forest along with Bharata.

Shlok 1: Bharata endowed with understanding, saw that assembly, enriched with the whole body
of respectable men, looking like a night in full moon duly enriched with well-known planets.

Shlok 2: That excellent assembly was aglow with the brilliance of clothes and scented
cosmetics of its respected members occupying their appropriate seats.

Shlok 3: That beautiful assembly filled with learned men looked like a night with autumn full
moon.

Shlok 4: Beholding all the entire body of ministers of the king, Vaishta the knower of
righteousness uttered to Bharata the following soft-spoken words:

Shlok 5: "O, beloved Bharata! The king Dasaratha, practicing righteousness, gave away to you
this wide earth endowed with grains and riches and went to heaven."

Shlok 6: "Rama, who was firmly established in truth, remembering the righteousness of good
men, did not abandon the command of his father, as a raising moon does not abandon the
moon-light."

Shlok 7: "The kingdom, having its enemies destroy was given to you by your father and
brother. Enjoy it, with its delightful ministers. Get anointed for the kingdom just soon."

Shlok 8: "let those living in the north, the Westerners; the southerners the kings of western
borders near the Sahya mountains who are without a throne and the seafaring traders bring crores of
jewels as gifts to you."

Shlok 9: Hearing those words, the pious Bharata was filled with distress and thirsting for
justice got his mind fixed on Rama.

Shlok 10: The youthful Bharata, with a voice of a Hamsa bird, in the midst of the assembly,
lamented in a tearful and appealing speech. He even reproached his royal priest as follows:

Shlok 11: "How can a man such as I, rob the throne from one, who practices Brahmacharya
(continence and chastity), versed in the science of the Vedas (sacred scriptures) and who is
devoted to duty?"

Shlok 12: "How should one born of Dasaratha become the usurper of a crown? Both the kingdom
and I myself belong to Rama. You ought to tell the law and justice in this matter."

Shlok 13: "Rama, the eldest son, an excellent man, a pious souled and who can be compared with
Dilipa* and Nahusha*, is eligible to get the kingdom, as with Dasaratha."

[Commentary] Dilipa and Nahusha: Two most ancient and illustrious representatives of the
solar and lunar dynasty respectively.

Shlok 14: "If in this world, I dishonoured the name of Ikshavaku race, I should be guilty of a
sinful act, practiced by disgraceful men, which does not lead to heaven."

Shlok 15: "I do not indeed like that sinful act done even by my mother. From here itself, I
offer my salutation with my joined palms to Rama who is residing in an impassable forest."

Shlok 16: "I will follow Rama's steps. He, who is supreme among men, is the king. Rama is
eligible even for the kingdom of the three worlds."

Shlok 17: Hearing those righteous words of Bharata, all the members of the assembly shed tears
of joy, having their minds obsessed of Rama.

Shlok 18: "If I am unable to bring back my elder brother from the forest, I shall stay back in
that forest itself, as how the venerable Lakshmana is staying now."

Shlok 19: "I shall use every means to bring back compulsorily, that hero before you,
practicing virtues, the honourable and the distinguished men."

Shlok 20: "All those who are skilled in clearing paths working on and without wages, have been
sent by me in advance and the journey so planned, pleases me."

Shlok 21: The pious minded Bharata, who had an affection for his brother spoke as aforesaid
and uttered the following words to Sumantra who was clever in giving counsel and who was sitting
nearby.

Shlok 22: "O, Sumantra! Rise quickly and go. As per my orders, arrange for the jorney
immediately. Bring the army also."

Shlok 23: Hearing the words of the magnanimous Bharata, Sumantra joyfully arranged all that in
accord with Bharata's orders and wishes.

Shlok 24: Hearing about the expedition of the army too; for arranging of return of Rama, the
ministers and army-commander there were delighted.

Shlok 25: All the wives of warriors in every house, knowing about the ensuing expedition, were
jubiliant and hurried up all their respective husband to setoff for the journey.

Shlok 26: Those army-generals urged the entire army to march forward quickly, with the fast
moving horses, bullock carts with a good speed and the chariots along with the warriors.

Shlok 27: Seeing that army ready, Bharata in the presence of Vasishta said as follows to
Sumantra who was standing by his side: "Get ready my chariot quickly."

Shlok 28: Bowing to the command of Bharata and taking a chariot yoked with excellent horses,
Sumantra on his part approached him with delight.

Shlok 29: Bharata, born in Raghu dynasty who was sincere in his purpose a powerful man having
strong and mighty prowess and whose talk was most appropriate, then spoke as follows: intending (to
undertake a journey) to persuade his illustrious elder brother, staying in dreary woods, to return
to Ayodhya.

Shlok 30: "O, Sumantra! Rise up and proceed quickly to inform the army-chief to arrange for
the troops. After propitiating that Rama staying in the forest, I want to bring him back to Ayodhya
for the welfare of the people."

Shlok 31: Sumantra, having received that explicit command from Bharata, which fulfilled his
highest hopes, called all the ministers-in-chief, the chiefs of the army and the friendly
multitude.

Shlok 32: Thereupon, from every house, warriors merchants, Shudras and Brahmanas rose up and
harnessed their chariots to camels, mules, well-bred elephants and horses.

Shlok 8: "When shall we see the mighty armed prince, of the hue of dark cloud, whose courage
is unshakable, of inflexible purpose Rama, who banished sorrow from the earth?"

Shlok 9: "Beholding Rama, our entire sorrow will indeed be dispelled, as darkness of the
entire earth is dispelled at the rising of the sun."

Shlok 10: Thus did the citizens of Ayodhya recount happily of Rama's glorious deeds, and they
embraced each other as they went along.

in sacred scriptures and riding on bullock-carts, accompanied Bharata.

Shlok 17: All of them, attired in clean and fair raiment, anointed with pure red sandal-paste,
mounted on various kinds of vehicles, followed Bharata tranquilly.

Shlok 18: Exceedingly pleased and cheerful, that army escorted the son of Kaikeyi- Bharta who
was affectionate towards his brother and who had set out along with his family to bring his
brother, Rama.

Shlok 19- 20: Having gone for a considerable distance in their chariots, carts, horses and
elephants, they reached the River Ganga close to the city of Shringaberapura, where the valiant
Guha, a bosom friend of Rama along with multitude of relatives was ruling that region
carefully.

Shlok 21: That army, which was accompanying Bharata, arrived at the bank of Ganga River,
looking beautiful as it was with Charka* birds and stopped there.

[Commentary] Chakra bird: zoological name= Anas casarca.

Shlok 22: Seeing the army behind, which accompanied him and the River Ganga in front with its
propitious waters, Bharata who was skillful in words, spoke to all his officers (as follows):

Shlok 23: "It is my will that my army should take rest by all means. When they are refreshed
we shall cross the river tomorrow."

Shlok 24: "Meanwhile, descending into the river, I desire to make offering of the sacred water
as libation for the infinite spirit relating to the state after death, to the king Dasaratha who
has gone to heaven."

Shlok 25: Hearing these words from Bharata, the officers attentively answered, "Be it so" and
each of them encamped their respective forces in accord with his pleasure.

Shlok 26: Having meticulously arranged for encampment of the army which looked lovely along
Ganga that great river with the surrounding equipment (like tunts, furnishings etc), Bharata halted

Shlok 1: Just on seeing an army encamped and positioned along the River Ganga, Guha the king
of Nishadas hastily spoke to his relatives as follows:

Shlok 2: "On this side, a huge army is seen like an ocean. I am not able to comprehend the
extent of this army even by my discerning mind."

Shlok 3: "Here is seen on that chariot, a towering banner bearing Kovidara tree and hence
Bharata himself with an evil intent seems to have come."

[Commentary] Kovidara tree: pomegranate tree.

Shlok 4- 5: "Will Bharata the son of Kaikeyi bind us with chains or slay us? Or is he coming to
kill Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who was exiled from the kingdom by his father, desirous as Bharata
is to get the prosperous Ayodhya kingdom, a luxury and that which is inaccessible to another?"

Shlok 6: "Rama the son of Dasaratha is my Lord and my companion too. Hence you, covered with
armor, be stationed on this bank of Ganga River, desiring to advance the interest of Rama."

Shlok 7: "Let all our ferrymen guarding the river, along with the troops, eating meat roots
and fruits ( in their boats), stay positioned along the River Ganga."

Shlok 8: "Let five hundred boats, each manner by a hundred youthful ferrymen, be stationed
and made ready" -thus announced Guha.

Shlok 9: "If Bharata is favourably disposed now towards Rama, then only his army may (be
allowed to) cross the River Ganga in safety."

Shlok 10: After uttering thus, Guha the king of Nishadas took fish, meat and honey as an
offering and approached Bharata.

Shlok 11: Seeing him approach, Sumantra the charioteer, a majestic man who knows the rules of
discipline, humbly told Bharata as follows:

Shlok 12: "This Lord who is surrounded by a thousand of his own people, is fully acquainted
with the forest of Dandaka and also an old friend of your elder brother."

Shlok 13: "O, Bharata! For that reason, let Guha the king of Nishadas see you. He knows surely
where those two Rama and Lakshmana - are stationed."

Shlok 14: Hearing the auspicious words of Sumantra, Bharata answered, "Introduce Guha to me
without delay."

Shlok 15: Having obtained permission, Guha along with his own people, joyfully and humbly
approached Bharata and spoke as follows:

Shlok 16: "This place is like a pleasure-grove near your house. We are your subjects and are
reporting to you as such. Stay in this servant's house."

Shlok 17: "Here are the roots and fruits gathered by my tribe as well as fresh and dried meat
of great quality and of various kinds, and all a produce of the forest."

Shlok 18: "I hope the army, after eating well, can halt for the night here. Furnished with all
you could desire, you can continue your journey tomorrow along with your troops."

Bharata thanks Guha for having come forward to offer hospitality to him and his 
		army. He enquires about the proper route to proceed to the hermitage of Bharadvaja. Guha assures 
		Bharata that he along with some of his ferrymen will follow him as guides. When Guha enquires 
		Bharata whether he has an evil intention towards Rama, Bharata clarifies him that he is proceeding 
		to Rama?s place to bring him back to Ayodhya. When night falls Bharata along with Shatrughna 
		and his army take rest. However Guha consoles Bharata, who has been constantly bewailing, till 
		the nightfall.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words, the highly intelligent Bharata replied toGuha, the lord of Nishadas, 
in words that were full of reason and meaning.

Shlok 2: ?O, friend of my elder brother! Indeed, your desire to offerhospitality to my army of 
such a magnitude, is great.?

Shlok 3: Having spoken these excellent words to Guha; the greatlyillustrious Bharata, possessed 
of great splendor, said again to Guha the kingof Nishadas (as follows):

Shlok 4: ?O, Guha! By which of these two routes can I go to the hermitageof Bharadvaja? This region 
engulfed in waters of Ganga River is not very much easy to negotiate and is difficult to cross.?

Shlok 5: Hearing the words of the wise prince; Guha, who roams about inwoods, with joined palms 
answered as follows:

Shlok 6: ?O highly illustrious prince! My ferrymen wielding their bows,and very attentive, will 
certainly accompany you. I too will follow you (inperson).?

Shlok 7: ?I hope you are not going to attack Rama, who is unwearied inaction. This great army 
of yours is begetting an apprehension in my mind.?

Shlok 8: Bharata, whose heart resembled a taintless sky, spoke thefollowing words in smooth voice, 
to that Guha, who confessed his doubt asaforesaid.

Shlok 9: ?Let not such an occasion of wretchedness come! You should neverhave suspected me. That 
Rama my elder brother is indeed regarded as my father.?

Shlok 10: ?I am going to get back Rama who is now living in the forest. O,Guha! No other apprehension 
should be made by you. I am telling you the truth.?

Shlok 11: Hearing the words of Bharata, Guha on his part, with his faceradiated with joy spoke 
again to Bharata as follows:

Shlok 12: ?You be blessed! I do not see your equal on this earth - you, whowish to renounce the 
empire you acquired now, even without effort.?

Shlok 13: Assuredly your fame will traverse permanently in all provinces,as you are the very person 
who wishes to bring back Rama from his terribleplight.

Shlok 14: While Guha was talking thus to Bharata, the sun diffused lesslight and the night fell.

Shlok 15: The illustrious Bharata, lodging that army in camps, feltdelighted by Guha?s hospitality, 
returned to his camp and took rest along withShatrughna.

Shlok 16: The high soled Bharata, whose only aim is to fulfill his duty andwho is undeserving of 
sorrow, indeed felt grief, born of anguish for Rama.

Shlok 17: As a fire is hidden in a hollow tree while a forest is on fire, sodid Bharata?s fire 
of anguish burn with in his heart.

Shlok 18: Perspiration born of fieriness of grief poured off from all hislimbs, as the snow heated 
by solar rays melts and flows from Himavat mountain.

Shlok 19-20: Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi was pressed by the weight of thatcolossal mountain of agony 
consisting of rocky caverns in the shape of settledcontemplations on Rama, minerals in the shape of 
groans and sighs, a cluster oftrees in the shape of depressive thoughts, summits in the form of sufferingsand 
fatigue, countless wild beasts in the shape of swoons, herbs and bamboos inthe form of his exertions.

Shlok 21: Thereafter, Bharata the excellent among men sighing much inmelancholy, his mind utterly 
confused in consequence, having obtained anextreme distress, afflicted as he was with burning fever 
in his breast and likea bull strayed from its herd, found no peace.

Shlok 22: The noble soled Bharata, with his escort, met Guha too in acomposed mind. Then Guha slowly 
reassured Bharata again as regards his elderbrother.



SARGA 86
------------------------------

[Text] Guha reports to Bharata, how Rama and his party broke their journey at
Shringaverapura and narrate to him the dialogue that took place between Lakshmana and himself
during that night. Guha further tells him how Rama and Lakshmana matted their hair into a thick
mass crossed the holy river with Seetha and left for the hermitage of Sage Bharadwaja.

Shlok 1: Then Guha the foremost dweller reported Bharata, who was having incomprehensible
qualities, about the quality of goodness of Lakshmana(as follows):

Shlok 2: "I spoke as follows to that Lakshmana, who is endowed with virtues and wielding
arrows bow and a sword and who was keeping a vigil for the safe guard of his brother."

Shlok 3: "O, dear brother! Here is a comfortable bed made ready for you. Feel yourself at
ease. Rest peacefully on this, O, delight of the Raghu race!"

Shlok 4: "All my people are habituated for hardships, o virtuous prince! You are used to
comfort. Hence ,we shall keep awake for the safe guard of Rama."

Shlok 5: "None is more dear to me than Rama on this earth. Moreover, do not become restless.
I am telling this truth in your presence."

Shlok 6: "By the grace of Rama, I wish to attain a very great renown in this earth, an
extensive acquisition of righteousness, an unalloyed wealth and enjoyment."

Shlok 7: "I as such with a bow in my hand, along with my relatives will guard my dear friend
Rama, who slept together with Seetha."

Shlok 8: "Nothing is indeed unknown to me, who forever wander in this forest. We can defeat
even an army consisting of all the four limbs in battle."

Shlok 9: "Thus spoken as aforesaid by us the high soled Lakshmana, who perceives
righteousness alone,politely replied to all of us( as follows)

Shlok 10: "How is it possible for me to get a sleep, or even life or comforts when Rama is
reposing on the floor along with Seetha?"

Shlok 11: "O, Guha! Behold that Rama, who cannot be conquered in a battle even by all the
celestials and demons, sleeping on the blades of grass along with Seetha."

Shlok 12: "This Rama is an excellent son, having qualities equal to those of Dasaratha. The
king obtained Rama by performing a great penance and after facing various troubles."

Shlok 13: "When Rama having seen exiled, the king Dasaratha will not survive for long.This
earth will surely be without a husband soon."

Shlok 14: "The women in the gynoecium's, having cried with a great noise, would have ceased
their crying out of fatigue. Now, the great noise would have stopped in the royal palace by
now."

Shlok 15: "I do not expect whether all of them, like Kausalya Dasaratha and even my mother
Sumitra will survive at all till this night."

Shlok 16: "By beholding Shatrughna, my mother perhaps may even survive. However, the afflicted
Kausalya who gave birth to the eminent Rama will surely die."

Shlok 17: Without realising his long-cherished wish and failing to install Rama in the kingdom
of Aodhya, my father Dasaratha will expire."

Shlok 18: "Those who have accomplished their purpose (Shatrughna and others) will perform all
the funeal honours to king Dasaratha, my father when the time comes for it."

Shlok 19- 20- 21: "They will joyfully inhabit my father capital City, with its pleasant cross roads
and meeting places, with its main roads well laid out, sumptuous with large houses and lofty
mansions, with all the gems they are encrusted, with elephants horses and chariots that abound
there, the sound of trumpets with which the city resonates, the many diversions it contains, its
properous and well-fed people, its luxurious gardens and parks as well as the assmeblies and
festivals that continuously take place inti."

Shlok 22: Shall we enter Ayodhya happily along with that virtuous Rama, who has truly redeemed
his promise, when he completed his term of exile?

Shlok 23: While that magnamimous prince was lamenting thus, standing guard, the night
passed.

Shlok 24: "When the sun rose brightly in the next morning Rama and Lakshmana got their locks
of hair matted into a thick mass at the banks of River Ganga and they were safely ferried by
me."

Shlok 25: "Rama and Lakshmana, who were capable of tormenting their enemies, possessing great
strength, wearing matted locks of hari and clothes made of bark, like unto the leaders of herd of
elephants, wielding excellent bow, arrows and sword, looking back at me, went away with Seetha.



SARGA 87
------------------------------

[Text] Hearing Guha's words about Rama, Bharata fell unconscious. Bharata eases himself
thereafter and asks Guha to report further details about Rama. Guha informs that eventhough he
offered various kinds of flood to Rama, the latter refused it. He adds that Rama Seetha and
Lakshmana observed fasting for that night. Guha also informs Bharata that Lakshmana laid a bed of
grass for Rama as well as Seetha to sleep theron and Lakshmana stood guarding Rama during the
night, along with Guha and his kinsmen.

Shlok 1: Hearing those most disagreeable words from Guha, Bharata began to think deeply,
directing his mind on Rama, of whom those unpleasant words were heard.

Shlok 2-3: That gentle, extremely courageous and the mighty armed young prince, whose shoulders
resembled a lion's his large eyes opening like a flowering lotus and having pleasing appearance,
momentarily sighed and in his extreme anguish, sank to the ground suddenly like an elephant that
has been wounded in the heart with goads.

Shlok 4: Seeing Bharata unconscious, Guha growing pale, shook like a tree during an
earthquake.

Shlok 5: Shatrughna, who stood near, taking Bharata, who was in that unconscious state in his
arms, becoming non-pulsed, cried loudly, overcome as he was with grief.

Shlok 6: Then, all the queens, emaciated through fasting, extremely miserable, being unable
to find consolation for the sad end of their lord, rushed towards Bharata.

Shlok 7: All of them, sobbing, surrounded Bharata who fell on the ground. Kausalya on her
part, torn with grief and bending over him, embraced him.

Shlok 8: That affectionate Kausalya, agitated as she was with grief and looking miserable,
pressing him to her bosom as a cow its own calf, questioned Bharata (in the following words)

Shlok 9: "O, son! I hope that no ailment afflicts your body. Now, the life of this royal race
is indeed dependent on you."

Shlok 10: "O, son! Rama along with Lakshman has gone to the forest. The king Dasaratha is
dead. I survive, looking on you. Now, you alone are the protector for us."

Shlok 11: "I hope you have not heard any unpleasant news about Lakshmana or about Rama my one
and the only son who left for the forest along with his wife."

Shlok 12: Bharata of great renown, easing himself well within a moment, consoled Kausalya and
while still weeping, spoke to Guha (as follows)

Shlok 13: "O, guha! Tell me where did Rama my brother as also Seetha and Lakshmana halt in the
night? On what couch and eating what, did he repose?

Shlok 14: Guha, the Lord of Nishadas, thrilling with rapture, spoke to Bharata about the
manner in which he made arrangements for (feeding and reposing) his beloved and kind guest,
Rama.

Shlok 15: "Various kinds of food and drink and different varieties of fruits were brought
repeatedly by me to the presence of Rama for the purpose of his consumption."

Shlok 16: Rama, the truly courageous man, refused all of them. Reminding himself of his
warrior's statute, he could not accept it.

Shlok 17: "O, Bharata! We were pacified by that high-souled Rama by saying thus: ' O, friend!
We are not allowed to receive anything we must always be givers."

Shlok 18: "Rama, of great glory, then along with Seetha drank the water brought by Lakshman as
observed fasting."

Shlok 19: "Thereafter Lakshmana also drank the left-over water and those three practised
silence together in that evening-twilight.

Shlok 20: "Lakshmana then personally brought a layer of Kusa grass and arranged a fittingly
nice bed with it for Rama immediately."

Shlok 21: "Rama, along with Seetha, settled down on that bed. After washing their feet,
Lakshmana went away to a distance."

Shlok 22: "Here at this fort of Ingndi Tree, on just this grass, on which both Rama and Seetha
slept that night."

Shlok 23: "Lakshmana, the scourge of his foe, wearing a glove of goha skin, strapping two
quivers full of arrows on either side of his back and wielding a great stringed bow, remained on
his part walking round Rama during that night."

Shlok 24: "Wearing excellent arrows and a bow along with my vigilant kinsmen carrying their
bows, I on my part remained near Lakshman, who was guarding Rama who vied with Indra the Lord of
celestials."



SARGA 88
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata and his minister approach the foot of Angudi tree, where Rama has slept on a
grass-bed on the ground. Bharata feels bad that on his account, Rama and Seetha were to sleep on
such a grass-bed. He thinks that the city of Ayodhya is plunged in desolation, because of the death
of Dasaratha and the exile of Rama to the forest. Bharata further takes an owe that like Rama, he
will also henceforth sleep on grass with his locks matted, wearing robes of bark and living only on
roots and fruits. He says that if Rama refuses his appeal to occupy the throne of Ayodhya, he also
will stay back in the forest along with Rama.

Shlok 1-2: Having heard all that perfectly, Bharata approached the foot of Ingudi Tree along
with his ministers and gazed on that grass-bed on which Rama had slept. Thereafter, he said to all
his mothers as follows: "It is here that the magnanimous hero laid himself for that night, his
limbs pressing the earth."

Shlok 3: "Born of the great and segacious Dasaratha in an illustrious family, Rama verily
does not desrve to sleep on this bare earth!"

Shlok 4: "How could Rama the tiger among men, who used to sleep on a couch horded with rich
cushions covered with superior hairy skins of antelopes, sleep on a bare floor?"

Shlok 5- 6- 7- 8- 9: "Having ever dwelt in palaces, the upper apartments resembling the chariots of the
gods and in turrets, furnished with excellent carpets decked with heaps of flowers, perfumed with
sandal and aloes, like unto a bright and towering cloud, re-echoing to the cries of parrots,
suprassing the finest of palaces, which wre cool and fragrant with perfules, as unto Mount Meru
with its golden walls, where in that palace he was awakened at the fitting time by sogns and music
from various instruments, tinkling of ornaments and the excellent sounds of clay tomtoms, glorified
by many panegyrists, bards and ministrels throught appropriate ballads and songs of praise."



"This ( such a prince becoming like this) is unbelievable in the world and does not
appear true to me. My mind is indeed bewildered. I wish that it were a dream."

Shlok 11: "Surely even a deity is not a little more powerful than Time (the will of god),
since that Rama, the son of Dasaratha has to sleep on the bare ground!"

Shlok 12: "Even Seetha the daughter of the king of videha, lovely to look upon and the
cherished daughter-in-law of Dasaratha has to sleep on the floor!"

Shlok 13: "This is the bed of my elder brother. Here are indeed the blessed marks of his
changing sides, in the form of all the blades of Kusa grass, trampled by his limbs on the hard
ground."

Shlok 14: "I think the blessed Seetha has slept on this bed along with her jewels for, some
particles of gold appear to be stuck up, here and there."

Shlok 15: "It is very clear that the upper garment of Seetha got entangled with these blades
here at that time. That is why, these silk-threads appear stuck to them."

Shlok 16: "I think the bed of her husband is sweet to a woman and thought Seetha is young and
unfortunate, yet however delicate she be, she would experience no suffering."

Shlok 17: "Alas! I am a cruel man because on my account, Rama, like an orphan, along with his
wife slept on such a bed."

Shlok 18- 19: "How can Rama, born in the race of monarchs, highly honoured by the entire world,
beloved of all the people, having a dark complexion as that of a blue-lotus, having red eyes,
lovely to look at who is entittled for comfort and who is not worthy of suffering, sleep on the
gound, abandoning excellent kingdom and comfort?"

Shlok 20: "Lakshmana, having auspicious marks on his body and an exceedingly lucky man, who
accompanied his elder brother Rama in times of adversity in indeed a fortunate man."

Shlok 21: "Seetha, who went together with her husband to the forest, is indeed an accomplished
woman. All of us, deprived of the highly virtuous Rama, are an unsettled lot."

Shlok 22: "Dasaratha went to heaven. Rama is dwelling in the forest. this kingdom appears to
me as a boat without ahelmsman."

Shlok 23: "Even if staying in the forest, Rama protects this earth with the power of his arms.
Hence, nobdy can think even in his mind, to invade this kingdom."

Shlok 24- 25: "Without guards to watch over its ramparts, with its unrestrained horses and
elephants, with its city-gates laid open, without any defenders, denuded of its happy army, plunged
in desolation in difficulties and exposed, that royal capital of Ayodhya will be shunned like
poisoned food even by the enemies."

Shlok 26: "From today onwards, I shall sleep on the earth or on the grass, with my locks
matted, wearing robes of bark and by all means living on fruits and roots."

Shlok 27: "For the rest of his exile, on behalf of Rama, I shall dwell cheerfully in the
forest, thereby discharging that promise so that the vows of Rama shall not have been made in
vain."

Shlok 28: "Shatrughna will bear company with me, residing in the forest on behalf of Rama. My
elder brother, Rama along with Lakshmana will protect Ayodhya."

Shlok 29: "Rama will be enthroned in ayodhya, by Brahmanas the Twice-born! May the gods grant
that my desire be made a reality."

Shlok 30: "Should Rama not accept the respectful appeals made in many a way by me, I shall
follow the foot steps of Rama for any length of time he roams about in the forest thereafter. He
ought not to refuse this grace to me."

[Text] Having passed the night on the banks of Ganga, Bharata asks Guha to make
arrangements for their troops to cross the river by boats. Accordngly, Guha has kept ready five
hundred boat with their ferry-men for the purpose. All of them reach the opposite shore of ther
river. Encamping the army at the shore in the magnificient woods of Prayaga, Bharata along with the
priests and king's counsellors, approach the hermitage of Bharadwaja.

Shlok 1: Bharata, born in Raghu race, having passed the night in that place on the banks of
Ganga, rising at dawn, said to shatrughna as follows:

Shlok 2: "O, Shatrughna! wake up! Why sleep longer/ Bring guha the king of Nishadhas quickly
and be happy. Let him convey the army across the river."

Shlok 3: Thus urged by Bhrata, his brother Shatrughna said, "I am not sleeping. Thinking of
that Rama alone, I have been wakeful."

Shlok 4: While those two lions among men were talking themselves with each other thus, Guha
came in time and with joined palms, addressed Bharata saying:

Shlok 5: "O, Bhrata! Did you pass the night happily on the banks of the river? I hope all is
well with your army."

Shlok 6: Hearing those words of Guha spoken with affection, Bharata also in his devotion to
Rama, replied as follows:

Shlok 7: "O, king! The night passed leasantly fo r us. We were treated hospitably by you. Let
your fisher-men ferry us across Ganga River on your courtless boats."

Shlok 8: Hearing Bharata's command, Guha returned to the city in all haste and spoke to those
multitude of his people (as follows):

Shlok 9: "Rise, awake and may prosperity ever attend you! Duly haul the boats to the bank.
Let us carry the army across the river."

Shlok 10: Rising immediately on hearing the command of their king, they quickly brought
together five hundred boats from every quarter.

Shlok 11: Some excellent boats, possessing large bells were marked with Sawstika, well-kept
together with appropriate sails and adorned with flags.

Shlok 12: Then, Guha brought there one boat also adorned with Swastika, was covered with white
canvas, re-echoing with acclamations and which was beautiful.

Shlok 13- 14: Vasishta, the royal priest and whatever elderly Brahmanas were present there
ascended the boats, even before Bharata, Shatrughna, Kausalya, Sumitra. Whatever royal women were
present also took theri seats. Thereafter followed the king's wives a well as bullock- carts and
provisions.

Shlok 15: The sound of men setting fire to the huts, of those who were descending the steps
leading to the boat and those who were transporting their effects touched the sky.

[Commentary] It has been a convention among Indian troops in the past to burn whatever is
removing their essential things and tents while leaving a halting place in the course of their
march to a destination. The idea is not to leave any trace of their whereabouts for the enemy. The
practise was also believed to bring triumph to the troops who resorted to it.

Shlok 16: Thos boats, adorned with flags, steered by fisher-men themselves ran speedily, duly
carrying those passengers.

Shlok 17: Some were filled with women. Some were loaded with horses and some of them ferried
animals of draught of great value.

Shlok 18: Having reached the opposite shore, thsoe boats cleared those people and on the
return journey, the kinsfolk of guha plied them as easily as toy- boats made of bamboo.

Shlok 19: Goaded on by their mahouts, elephants adorned with their flags, swimming across the
river, looked life winged mountains.

Shlok 20: Some ascended boats. Some others crossed the river by rafts in the same manner. Some
others swam across with the help of big and small earthen vessels. The rest swam with arms.

Shlok 21: Having made to cross River Ganga by the fisher-men themselves, that holy army
reached the magnificient woods of Prayaga at the hour of Maitra.

[Commentary] The hour of early hours. A Muhurta, loosely translated as an hour, really
consist of 48 minutes. There are fifteen such Muhurtas in a day. They are named in order by
Brihaspati as Randra, Sarpa, maitra, Paitra, Vasava, Apya, Vaisva, Brahma, Praja, Isha, Sindra,
Aindragna, Nairta, Varunaryamana and Bhagi.

Shlok 22: The high-souled Bharata made the army to rest, by encamping it according to its
inclination and set out along with the priests and king's counsellors to meet Bharadwaja, the
foremost of sages.



Approaching the hermitage of that high-souled Brahmana and the family priest of
gods, Bharata saw an extensive and enchanting grove with its leafy huts and tress the chief of
ascatics.



SARGA 90
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata along with Vasishta proceed to see Bharadwaja. Bharadwaja welcomes both of
them hospitable. After exchanging pleasantries Bharadwaja asks Bharata whether he is coming to the
forest to do any harm to Rama and Lakshmana. Bharata replies that he is coming to the forest for
the purpose of taking back Rama to Ayodhya. When enquired by Bharata about the whereabouts of Rama,
Bharadwaja informs that Rama along with Seetha and Lakshmana are staying on the chitrakuta
mountain. Thereafter, at the request of Bharadwaja, Bharata along with his routine decides to make
a night halt on that day at that hermitage and to proceed to Chitrakuta on the following
morning.

Shlok 1- 2: Having seen Bharadwaja's hermitage at a couple of miles away, that excellent man
Bharata, knowing what is right, leaving all his army behind, discarding his weapons and ornaments,
and wearing simple silken garment, went forwards by foot, proceeded by Vasishta, his spiritual
preceptor.

Shlok 3: Leaving his ministers behind at a visible distance to Bharadwaja, Bharata then went
along with Vasishta, his spiritual preceptor.

Shlok 4: On seeing Vasishta, Bharadwaja the great ascetic rose quickly from his seat, asking
his disciples to fetch water to wash the hand (of the distinguished guests) with.

Shlok 5: Having met Vasishta and greeted by Bharata, Bharadwaja of great splendour recognized
him to be a son of Dasaratha.

Shlok 6: Bharadwaja, knowing what is right, offering them both, in order of seniority, water
to wash theri hands and feet with and fruits afterwards, made enquiries concerning the welfare of
their family.

Shlok 7: Subsequently, Bharadwaja made enquires with both of them as to whether all were well
in the city of Ayodhya, with the army, with the treasury, friends and counsellors. But knowing
Dasaratha friends and counsellors. But knowing Dasaratha to be dead, he did not speak of the
king.

Shlok 8: Vasishta and Bharata in return made enquires with Bharadwaja, if all were well with
his body his sacred fires, his disciples, the trees, the deer and birds in the hermitage.

Shlok 9: The great ascetic Bharadwaja replied, "All is well" and spoke the following words to
Bharata, bound as he was with affection to Rama.

Shlok 10: "For what reason have you, who are ruling the kingdom, come here? Tell me all this,
for my mind is not getting cleared of doubts."

Shlok 11- 12: "That annihilator of enemies, born of Kausalya for the increase of her happiness, he
who with his brother and his wife have been exiled to the forest for a long period, that Rama who
is full of glory, through the intrigues of a woman was condemned to dwell in the forest for
fourteen years by his father. I hope you do not intend to do any harm to that irreproachable prince
and his younger brother in order to enjoy the throne without hindrance."

Shlok 14: "Thus spoken to as aforesaid, Bharata with his eyes filled with tears in grief and
in a faltering tone, replied to Bharadwaja as follows:

Shlok 15: "If you the Blessed One, regard me like this, I am lost indeed! I cannot conceive of
any harm towards Rama having proceeded from me. do not charge me thus."

Shlok 16: " I do not approve of what my mother has done when I was away from home. I am not
pleased with her nor do I accept her word in this matter."

Shlok 17: "I, on my part, came to take back that tiger among men to Ayodhya, after prostrating
myself at his feet and having propitiated him."

Shlok 18: "O, venerable one! Believing me to have come for the aforesaid purpose, you ought to
do a favour for me. Tell me where Rama the Lord of the world is to be found now?"

Shlok 19: Requested by Vasishta and other priests likewise, Bharadwaja answered Bharata in
affectionate words as follows:

Shlok 20: "O, Bharata the tiger among men! Good manners towards teachers as well as self
control and walking in the footsteps of virtuous men-these qualities are worthy of you, born as you
are in the Raghu dynasty."

Shlok 21: " I was aware of your purpose in your mind. But, I desired to confirm it and it is
on this account that I asked you, in order to strengthen you fame immeasurably."

Shlok 22: "I know where the virtuous Rama along with Seetha and LakSmana are to be found. Your
elder brother is staying on the great mountain called Chitrakuta."

Shlok 23: "You may proceed to that place tomorrow. Stay here today along with your ministers.
O, man of great wisdom, who understands legitimate interest and desire! Grant me this desire."

Shlok 24: Bharata of a broad outlook and whose reality (as an admirer of Rama) had now come to
be known, answered thus: "So be it". Then, the prince made up his mind to stay for that night in
the hermitage."



SARGA 91
------------------------------

[Text] Having been instructed by Bharadwaja to bring the army to his place, Bharata allowed
his army also to come to the hermitage. Then, Bharadwaja invokes Visvakarma, the divine architect
and requests him to arrange for a befitting hopsitality to Bharata,

Shlok 1: Seeing he had resolved to halt at that place for the night, the sage Bharadwaja
prepared to offer Bharata the son of Kaikeyi the full honours due to a guest

Shlok 2: Then, Bharata said to Bharadwaja as follows: "Have you not presented me with water
to wash my hands and feet and offered me this hospitality fitting for a guest in this forest?"

Shlok 3: Then, Bharadwaja smilingly replied to Bharata as follows: "I know you possess a
friendly disposition and you are pleased with whatever is offered to you."

Shlok 4: "O, Bharata the excellent among men! I wish to offer food to your army. You ought to
fulfil my satisfaction in every suitable way."

Shlok 5: "O, warrior! Why did you come here, leaving your army at a distance? Why did you not
come to my place with your army?"

Shlok 6: Bharata, with joined palms, replied to Bharadwaja who was rich with austerity in the
following words: "O, venerable one! I have not come here with my army for the fear of displeasing
you."

Shlok 7: "O, Venerable One! Either the king or the prince should always keep away from the
places occupied by ascetics"

Shlok 8: "O, Holy one! Spirited horses, men and rare elephants in rut covering an immense
area are accompanying me."

Shlok 9: "Let them not damage the trees, huts and ground and defile the waters of hermitages'
- in this thought, I came alone."

Shlok 10: Thereafter Bharata, having been commanded by that great sage to bring the army
there, allowed the army's arrival to the hermitage.

Shlok 11: Meanwhile, entering the fire-sanctuary (the place where the sacrificial fire is
kept), sipping water and wiping the lips, Bharadwaja invoked Visvakarma (the architect of gods) in
order to fulfil his duties towards the guests (as follows)

Shlok 12: "I wish to offer hospitality to the guest I summon vishvakarma who is also the
divine carpenter. Let arrangements be made in that connection for me."

Shlok 13: "I further invoke the three gods (Yama, Varuna and Kubera) the guardians of the
worlds with Indra as their king. I wish to offer hospitality to the guests. Let arrangements be
made in this connection for me."

Shlok 14: "Let the rivers which flow towards the east and those which flow towards the west,
across the earth and in the aerial region now come together here from all quarters."

Shlok 15: "Let some rivers flow with Maireya ( a kind of wine made from date palms etc) some
others flow with highly refined spirituous liquor and some others flow with cool water with a taste
of sugarcane."

Shlok 16: "I invoke the celestials and celestial musicians Vishvavasu, Haha and Huhu as also
Apsaras (nymphs) belonging to the celestial and celestial musicians' race from all regions.

Shlok 17: "I invoke the celestial nymphs called ghritachi, Vishvachi, Mishra Kesi, Alambusa,
Nagadanta and Hema as also Hima who has an abode made in mountains."

Shlok 18: "I invoke the fair women who are attending on Brahma the Lord of creation - all of
them with their external appendages (like musical instruments) along with (their teacher)
Tumburu."

Shlok 19: "Let that beautiful garden in the region of northern Kuru, presided over by Kubera
(the god of riches) always with its leaves which serve as raiment and ornaments, with its fruits in
the form of heavenly damsels appear in this place."

Shlok 20: "Many the blessed moon-god (the duty presiding over annual plants) furnish me at
this place, excellent food of every variety, confections, sweets, sauces and syrups."

Shlok 21: "May the blessed moon-god furnish me many-coloured flowers which have just fallen
from the flower-plants or trees, the drinks like wine and others as also various kinds of
meat."

Shlok 22: That sage Bharadwaja, with his intense meditation, possessing unequal splendour and
with austerity, spoke as follows, in tones befitting proper articulation and pronunciation of the
scriptural texts:

Shlok 23: While that sage Bharadwaja, with joined palms, was meditating with absorption in the
east, all those celestials came one by one.

Shlok 24: Then, a pleasant comfortable and gracious breeze, passing over the mountains of
Malaya and Dardura, began to blw, removing sweat by its influence.

Shlok 25: Thereafter wonderful clouds let loose a rain of flowers, while the sound of divine
gongs could be heard on every side.

Shlok 26: Troops of Apsaras (divine nymphs) danced to the melodious rustling of the wind. The
clestials and the celestial musicians sang. Vinas, stringed musical instruments transmitted their
tunes.

Shlok 27: Sweat and harmonious sounds emitted smoothly, entered the sky earth and the ears of
beings.

Shlok 28: When those celestial melodies ceased so pleasingly heard by the human ears,
Bharata's army saw the wonderful creations of Visvakarma.

Shlok 29: A levelled land of approximately twenty miles on all sides, became covered by many
carpets of grass, dark as emerald.

Shlok 30: At that place, Bilva, Kapittha, Panasa, Citron Amalaki and Mango Trees laden with
fruit appeared.

Shlok 31: A forest of divine enjoyments from the territory of northern Kuru's along with a
river shaped with various trees on its bank appeared there.

Shlok 32: Splendid square mansions with stables for elephants and horses as well as
resplendent gates with watch-towers flanked by turrets were seen.

white garlands, filled with fragrance of celestial perfumes, forming a perfect quadrangle,
spacious, furnished with couches seats and palanquins, supplied with ambrosial drinks of every kind
as well as magnificent attire and food of every variety, well-prepared eatables of every
description in cleaned vessels free from dirt and all kinds of seats arranged in order looked
charming with superb couches duly covered with rich carpets.

Shlok 36: The mighty armed Bharata the son of Kaikeyi on invitation by the great sage, entered
that palace filled with precious gems.

Shlok 37: All the ministers together with priests accompanied Bharata and on entering that
excellent get-up of the house, were filled with delight

Shlok 38: Bharata along with his ministers went clock-wise round the excellent royal throne,
whisk and the royal umbrella kept there, as if they were utilized by a king.

Shlok 39: They paid reverence to the royal seat, bowing before it, as if Rama sat thereon and
thereafter Bharata, taking hold of the whisk, sat down on the seat meant for the chief
minister.

Shlok 40: All the ministers and priests sat down in order of precedence. Thereafter, the chief
of the army and at last the officer-in-charge of the encampment occupied their seats.

Shlok 41: Then, on an instant, by the orders of Bharadwaja, streams having milk thickened with
rice in the place of mud, flowed towards Bharata.

Shlok 42: On both the banks of those streams, enchanting and celestial houses plastered with
white clay born out of the grace of Brahma the Lord of creation, appeared.

Shlok 43: At that moment itself, twenty thousand women adorned with beautiful ornaments, sent
by Brahma, arrived.

Shlok 44: Twenty thousand more women, who were radiant and adorned with gold, gems, pearls and
corals came from the region of Kubera.

with insanity, came from Nandana grove.

Shlok 46: Those most excellent kings among celestial musicians - Narada, Tumbura and Gopa

Shlok 52- 53: "O, wine-bibbers! Drink the wine, however much you desire! O troops stricken with
hunger! Let milk thickened iwth rice and the meats which are very much fresh, be eaten (as you
will)"

Shlok 54: Seven or eight young women bathed every single man on the beautiful river-banks,
after massaging their body with oil.

Shlok 55: Women with charming eyes came running and shampooed their limbs. Lovely women
likewise wiped off the moisture on their body with towels and gave them beverages to drink,
mutually sharing them among each other.

offspring of Surabhi the divine cow) with their suitable feed.

Shlok 57: The animals, belonging to the exceedingly strong and illustrious warriors, the
descendents of Ikshvaku, were fed with pieces of sugarcane and roasted grain soaked in honey, duly
cajoling them to eat.

and thither.

they saw again those fresh dishes, there arose in them a desire to eat them again.

Shlok 65: Thousands of servants, slaves, youthful women and those in the army on every side,
clad in new raiment, became very much contented.

[Text] Bharata approaches the sage Bharadwaja and seeks his permission to leave. Bharata
asks Bhardwaja the exact route by which he can reach the abode of Rama. Bharadwaja gives the
details of the path towards the banks of river Mandakini, situated at the north of Chitrakuta
mountain, where Rama is stationed along with Seetha and Lakshmana. Hearing of the journey,
Dasaratha's wives approach Bharadwaja and offer their salutations to him. Bharata introduces his
mothers one by one to Bharadwaja. While introducing his mother, Kaikeyi to Bharadwaja, Bharata
describes Kaikeyi as the root-cause of their family's misfortune. But, the sage Bharadwaja consoles
him, saying that the exile of Rama would ultimately result in happiness the sages, celestials and
even the demons. Bharata finally bids farewell to the sage and proceeds to Chitrakuta, along with
his retinue.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, Bharata along with his routine, who were treated hospitably, spent that
night there and sought out Bharadwaja with fondness.

Shlok 2: The sage Bharadwaja, who had offered oblations in sacred fire, spoke to Bharata the
tiger among men, who had come there with joined palms, saying.

Shlok 3: "O, handsome Bharata! Have you passed this night at out place comfortably? Is your
retinue fully satisfied with my hospitality? Tell me."

Shlok 4: After joining his palms in salutation, Bharata replied to the very glorious sage
Bharawaja, who came out from his hermitage (as follows):

Shlok 5: "O, venerable sage! With all the enjoyments in plenty provided by you, I felt
comfortable and satisfied, along with very ministers my entire army and our animals too used in
riding.

Shlok 6: "All of us including our servants have become very much satisfied with our fatigue
and pains removed, having eaten a good food and having been provided an excellent
accommodation."

Shlok 7: "O, Blessed one! O, excellent sage I am taking leave of you. Look on me with favour
as I find myself in my brother's vicinity."

Shlok 8: "O, knower of piety! Tell me about the abode of that high-souled and pious man,
Rama. Tell me as to which way I have to go, how much distance it is from here and so forth."

Shlok 9: The highly glorious Bharadwaaja, of rigid asceticism, thus questioned by Bharata
(who intensely desired to see his brother again), answered him as follows:

Shlok 10: "O, Bharata! About twenty eight miles from here, there is a mountain called
Chitrakuta, in the middle of a lonely forest with its charming Cascades and groves."

Shlok 11: "Going towards its northern side, you will find River Mandakini, which is entirely
enveloped with flowering trees and having forests flourished with charming blossoms."

Shlok 12: "O, beloved Bharata! Beyond that river, there is a mountain called Chitrakuta and on
it, their hut made of leafy twigs. Both of them are residing there. It is sure."

Shlok 13: "O, the illustrious chief of army! Direct the forces filled with elephants horses
and chariots either towards the southern route or to the left proceeding southward. You can see
Rama then."

Shlok 14: Hearing him speak of the journey, Dasaratha's wives eligible of sitting in
palanquins, descended from their palanquins and stood encircling Bharadwaja.

Shlok 15: Kaikeyi with her unfulfilled desire and despised by the whole world, clasped the
sage's feet with bashfulness.

Shlok 16: Kaikeyi with her unfulfilled desire and despised by the whole world, clasped the
sage's feet with bashfullness.

Shlok 17: Then, having gone around that venerable and eminent sage clock-wise, she stood close
to Bharata himself, distressed as she was at heart.

Shlok 18: Then, Bharadwaja, firm in austerity, enquired Bharata as follows: "O, Bharata! I
wish to know the distinctions of your mothers."

Shlok 19: Hearing the words of the learned sage, Bharadwaja, Bharata who was skilled in
expression, with joined palms, spoke the following words.

Shlok 20- 21: "O, venerable sage! This miserable queen emaciated by grief and fasting, is the
royal consort of my father, who you see resembling a goddess - it is she, Kausalya who, as Aditi
gave birth to Upendra, begot that Tiger among the heroes, with the great gait and pride of a lion
that Rama."

Shlok 22- 23: She, who stands clinging to the left shoulder of Kausalya, plunged in grief is the
unfortunate Sumitra, looking like a branch of Karnikara tree with withered flowers standing in the
interior of the grove. Both Lakshmana and Shatrughna, the two heroic princes of god-like appearance
and unfailing prowess are the sons of this godly woman, Sumitra.

Shlok 24- 25- 26: "She, through whose fault, those two tigers among men have to obtain a miserable
existence and King Dasaratha deprived of his son, has gone to heaven this woman, who is irate,
imprudent, arrogant, who esteems herself to be good-looking, who is covetous of power, unworthy
though noble to all appearance, know her to be Kaikeyi, my mother of wicked and sinful resolve, in
whom I see the root cause of my great misfortune."

Shlok 27: Bharata, the tiger among men, with his red eyes spoke thus in a voice broken by sobs
and breathing as he like an enraged and hissing snake.

Shlok 28: Hearing the aforesaid words spoken by Bharata, Bharadwaja the great intellectual
sage replied in the following meaningful words.

Shlok 29: "O, Bharata! Kaikeyi is not intended to be understood by you accusatively. The exile
of Rama with indeed become ultimately a cause for happiness!"

Shlok 30: "Now, due to Rama's exile, there will indeed be a benefit to the celestials the
demons and the sages whose souls are purified by meditating on the Universal Spirit."

Shlok 31: Bharata satisfied, paid obeisance to him and circumambulated him in bidding a
farewell, directing the army to get prepared to leave.

Shlok 32: Then, setting out for their destination, countless people ascended many excellent
chariots, decorated with gold, duly harnessed to horses.

Shlok 33: Female and male elephants, wearing golden chains and flags, distinguished by the
sound of bells, like thundering clouds at the end of a summer marched in a form.

Shlok 34: Various precious conveyances, both big and small, marched forward. Pedestrians
marched forward by foot.

Shlok 35: Desirous of seeing Rama and delighted, Kausalya and other honourable women
thereafter advanced on their excellent conveyances.

Shlok 36: The illustrious Bharata mounted a readily kept palanquin which was auspiciously
shining like rising moon and sun and proceeded along with his escort.

Shlok 37- 38: That vast army with its countless elephants horses and chariots proceeded, covering
the southern direction, like a great cloud that has risen in the sky and on the other bank of the
Ganges, by mountains and streams, crossing the woods inhabited by deer and birds.

Shlok 39: That army of Bharata, with its squadrons of rejoicing elephants horses and warriors,
penetrating into the vast forest, frightening innumerable beasts and birds, appeared resplendent
there.



SARGA 93
------------------------------

[Text] Travelling for a long time, Bharata and his army reach Chitrakuta mountain. Bharata
Chitrakuta mountain. Bharata appreciates the beauty of that place and identifies it as an abode of
ascetics. He instructs his soldiers to explore the woods and find out where Rama and Lakshmana are
living. Valiant men penetrate into the forest and pursuing their search, they observe a plume of
smoke rising at some distance and concluding the site to be the hermitage of Rama. Bharata commands
his army to halt and decides to walk with Sumantra and Dhriti his spiritual preceptor to Rama's
hermitage.

Shlok 1: Seeing that large army on the march, the herds of beasts with their leaders, the
denizens of the woods were frightened and ran away together.

Shlok 2: Bears, dappled deer and antelopes could be seen every where, on the tracks of the
forest, on the hills and by the rivers.

Shlok 3: That pious minded Bharata gracefully marched ahead, surrounded by that clamorous
army of four divisions.

Shlok 4: The army, of the magnanimous Bharata, which resembled the high tide of an ocean,
covered the earth as clouds cover the sky in a rainy season.

Shlok 5: Submerged by the waves of horses and elephants of great speed at that time, the
earth became invisible for a long time.

Shlok 6: Having travelled for a long distance, that glorious Bharata, whose animals were now
fully exhausted, said to Vasishta, the most segaceios of his counsellors (as follows)

Shlok 7: "Looking at the features of the pace and from what has been heard by me, it is clear
that we reached that area of which Bharadwaja spoke."

Shlok 8: "This mountain is Chitrakuta. This river is Mandakini. This forest is appearing like
a blue cloud from a distance."

Shlok 9: "By my elephants appearing themselves like mountains, the lovely peaks of Chitrakuta
mountain are being trampled."

Shlok 10: "These trees on the peaks of the mountain are shedding flowers, as black and intense
clouds shower water in a rainy season."

Shlok 11: "Behold, O Shatrughna, this mountain, (hitherto) frequented by Kinnaras, now teaming
with horses on every side, as a sea is infested by allegators."

Shlok 12: "These herds of antelopes, having a rapid speed, as urged forward (by the troops)
appear like a mass of clouds driven by the wind in the sky in antumn."

Shlok 13: "Those tree, with their leaves in multitude dazzling, crowned with fragrant chaplets
of flowers, resemble the people of the south."

Shlok 14: "This forest, which was silent and wore a terrifying look till now, appears to me
like Ayodhya, swarning with people."

Shlok 15: "The dust raised from the hooves of the horses blots out the heavens, but the wind
carries it away immediately as if to give me pleasure."

Shlok 16: "Behold, O Shatrughna, these chariots yoked with horses and mounted by the chief
charioteers are rushing together rapidly in the forest."

Shlok 17: "Behold these peacocks and birds, which are pleasant to the sight, are frightened
and are entering their dwelling places hastily."

Shlok 18: "This place to me is appearing very much lovely. Resembling in every way like a
threshold of heaven, it is clearly an abode of ascetics."

Shlok 19: "In this forest, many dappled deer with their hinds, endowed with enchanting forms,
are seen as if studded with flowers."

Shlok 20: "Let the soldiers proceed quickly to explore the woods to find those tigers among
men, Rama and Lakshamana."

Shlok 21: Hearing the words of Bharata, valiant men wearing weapons in their hands, penetrated
into the forest suddenly they observed a plume of smoke rising.

Shlok 22: Seeing that spiral of smoke, they returned to bharata and said; "There can be no
fire in a deserted place. Assuredly, Rama and Lakshmana are there."

Shlok 23: "If it be not those two tigers among men, the two princes, the scourger of their
foes here, obviously there are other ascetics like Rama here."

Shlok 24: Hearing those words concurred even by pious men, Bharata the destroyer of enemy's
forces, spoke to the entire army (as follows)

Shlok 25: "You stay here vigilantly. Do no proceed any further. I alone will go along with
Sumantra and also Dhriti, my spiritual preceptor."

Shlok 26: On this command, all the troops halted there and Bharat with his gaze fixed on the
column of smoke, went forward.

Shlok 27: The army, which was held up there by Bharata, eventhough perceiving the place ahead,
felt rejoiced in the thought of meeting their beloved Rama soon.

retreats, where vidyadharas and their women sport."

Shlok 13: "This mountain resembles an elephant with ichors flowing from its forehead, as from
its crevices, springs and cascades flow here and there."

Shlok 14: "Who would not be filled with delight, by these glades from which fragrance of
various flowers issues, pleasing to the senses?"

Shlok 15: "O, irreproachable lay! If I am live with you and Lakshmana for many autumns here,
grief will not overpower me."

Shlok 16: "O, Seetha! Seeing this mountain laden with many flowers and fruit, the enchanting
resort of flocks of birds as also the ravishing peaks of the mountain, I am really captivated."

Shlok 17: "By residing in the forest, a two-fold advantage is secured by me; freedom from debt
to my father in regards my duty and Bharata's happiness."

Shlok 18: "O, Seetha! Are you happy with me on this Chitrakuta mountain, seeing various
objects agreeable to your thought word and temperament?"

Shlok 19: "My paternal great grand fathers the ancient royal sages have said that for a king
to obtain liberation after death, such a residence in the forest is nectar like."

multifarious colours like blue, yellow, white and red."

some others appear like a single pile."

Shlok 23: "Chitrakuta appears as though emerged, having split the earth. This summit of
Chitrakuta appears charming on all sides."

Shlok 24: "See the leaves of lilies, Sthagara trees, Punnaga trees and Bhurja trees heaped
with flowers of water-lilies form the cozy beds of voluptuaries."

Shlok 27: "O, Seetha! Strolling with you and Lakshmana during this period of exile, on my part

[Text] Rama describes to Seetha the beauty of Mandakini River with its multi-coloured
beaches, swans, geese, deer and flowery trees on its banks. He shows some sages taking dip in the
river and herds of elephants and monkeys coming for a drink there. Thus Rama and Seetha spend some
of their time in enjoying the charms of Chitrakuta mountain.

Shlok 1: Then, turning away from the mountain, Rama (The prospective ruler of Kosala) showed
Seetha (the daughter of the King of Mithila) the beautiful river of Mandakini carrying splendid
waters.

growing on its banks and enhance its loveliness like the lake (Sangadhika) of Kubera (the ruler of
Yakshas)"

Shlok 5: "At this moment, its pleasant fords, where herds of deer drink and make the waters
turbid, create ecstasy in me."

Shlok 6: "O, beloved Seetha! Sages with matted locks and wearing antelope-skins and having
bark of trees for their upper garment, take a dip in the River Mandakini, at the appointed
hour."

Shlok 7: "O, Lady of wide eyes! Here are some other sages of austere vows, worshipping the
sun with uplifted arms; as per the scriptural injunctions."

Shlok 8: "The trees, their crowns agitated by the breeze, that shower down leaves and flowers
on both sides of the river cause the mountain to appear as though it were dancing!"

Shlok 9: "See this River Mandakini with its crystal-like clear water at some places, with its
shining sand-dunes at some places and crowded with Siddhas who are bathing at some other
places."

[Commentary] Siddha: A class of semi-divine beings endowed with mystic powers.

Shlok 10: "Behold you, heaps of flowers shaken down by the wind and shattered. See some other
heaps of flowers floating, O lady with slender waist!"

Shlok 11: "O, Kalyani! Behold the sweet-voiced ruddy geese, ascending the banks uttering
harmonious tones."

Shlok 12: "I consider this sight of Mandakini River and of Chitrakuta, particularly at your
sight, to be more delightful than dwelling in the City of Ayodhya, O, lovely woman!"

Shlok 13: Here are Siddhas (semi-divine beings endowed with mystic powers), free from
impurities and rich in asceticism, with their senses and mind under control, who perpetually stir
the waters. You too should take a dip in the river along with me."

Shlok 14: "Enter the Mandakini River, as on the breast of a friend, submerging the red and
white lotuses in it- O, Lovely Seetha!"

Shlok 15: "My darling! Think of the wild beasts as inhabitants of the city of Ayodhya, this
mountain of Chitrakuta as the city of Ayodhya and this river as the Sarayu from now on!"

Shlok 16: "O, Seetha!; The virtuous Lakshmana is obeying my commands and you too are
well-disposed, causing delight to me."

Shlok 17: "Bathing three times a day in the river and living on honey, roots and fruits in
your company, I do not desire for the kingdom nor do I long for Ayodhya now."

Shlok 18: "There is none in the world, who would not be relieved of his fatigue and feel
refreshed on the banks of this enchanting river, frequented by herds of elephants, who with lions
and monkeys, come here to drink and which is adorned with innumerable flowers in full bloom."

Shlok 19: Describing the varied beauties of the Mandakini River, Rama the bestower of delight
to Raghu dynasty with his beloved consort as a companion, strolled in the lovely mountain of
Chitrakuta which was shining like a piece of collieries."



SARGA 96
------------------------------

[Text] Rama hears a gigantic clamour of an army nearby and asks Lakshmana to find out what
it is. Lakshmana ascends a tree and informs Rama that Bharata's army is approaching towards their
hermitage. Lakshmana expresses his apprehension to Rama, saying that Bharata's army may be coming
there in order to kill both of them. An enraged Lakshmana says that he will kill both Bharata and
Kaikeyi together with the army.

Shlok 1: Having shown Mandakini River in that manner to Seetha, the daughter of Mithila, Rama
set on the hill-side in order to gratify her appetite with a piece of flesh.

Shlok 2: Rama, whose mind was devoted to righteousness stayed there with Seetha, saying;
"This meat is fresh, this is savoury and roasted in the fire."

Shlok 3: While Rama was thus sitting there the dust and clamour of Bharata's army, which was
approaching, ascended into the sky.

Shlok 4: Meanwhile, frightened by that gigantic clamour, the leaders of elephants and other
animal - troops, in rut, were tormented and fled in different directions from there.

Shlok 5: Rama heard that sound generated from the army and also saw all those leaders of the
animal-flock, running away from there.

Shlok 6: Seeing those animals running away and hearing that clamour, Rama spoke to Lakshmana
(son of Sumitra) of burning courage as follows:

Shlok 7: "Alas! O, Lakshmana! Sumitra is blessed with a noble son in you. Here is heard a
tumultuous sound as terrific as that of a roaring cloud. See what it is."

Shlok 8: "The lordly elephants in the forest, the buffaloes in the great woods and the wild
beasts frightened by lions are suddenly running away in various directions."

Shlok 9: "O, Lakshmana! You ought to find out whether it is a king or a prince roaming for a
hunt or some other savage beast."

Shlok 10: "O, Lakshmana! This mountain is difficult of access even to birds. You ought to find
out soon, all this in an accurate manner."

Shlok 11: Lakshmana quickly ascended a Sala tree in flowering and looking towards all
directions, saw towards eastern side.

Shlok 12: Looking in northern direction, Lakshmana saw a huge army, full of chariots, steeds
and elephants accompanied by smart foot-soldiers.

Shlok 13: Lakshmana informed Rama about that army which was full of horses, elephants and
chariots decorated with flags and spoke the following words also.

Shlok 14: "O, honourable brother! Extinguish the fire. Let Seetha occupy a hiding place. Make
your bow ready with a bow-string and arrows. Wear an armour."

Shlok 15: Rama the tiger among men replied to Lakshmana, saying: "O, Lakshmana! See, whose
army do you think is this?"

Shlok 16: Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana was irritated like a fire and spoke the following
words, as though he was wishing to scorch the army.

Shlok 17: "Bharata, Kaikeyi's son, having obtained coronation and desirous of making the
kingdom free of enemies, is coming here to kill both of us. It is clear."

Shlok 18: "The gigantic and glorious tree with superb branches is shining over there
prominently. The ensign bearing the device of a kovidara (pomegranate) tree is shining on that
chariot."

Shlok 19: Among the cavalry, some are cavorting merrily on their swift horses, while others
are beaming with delight, mounted on their elephants.

Shlok 20: "O, warrior! Let us take up our bows and ascend the mountain or let us stay here
itself, fully prepared with our weapons in our hands."

Shlok 21: "O, Rama! Will that flag with the insignia of a Kovidara tree come into our
subjugation? Can we see Bharata, because of whom a great misfortune has occurred to you, to Seetha
and to me?"

Shlok 22: "O, Rama the warrior! By the reason of whom you were deprived of an eternal kingdom,
such Bharata as a foe who is coming here, deserves to be slain by me."

Shlok 23: "O, Rama! I see no sin in slaying Bharata. None is charged with unlawfulness, if one
strikes down an aggressor."

Shlok 24: "Bharata is the assailant and his death is legitimate. He being dead, you will rule
the entire earth."

Shlok 25: "Let Kaikeyi, who is craving for the kingdom see, with great sorrow, her son slain
by me today in battle, as a tree is crushed down by an elephant."

Shlok 26: "I shall kill Kaikeyi too along with her friend the hunch-back and other
accomplices. Let the earth today be relieved of a great sinner."

Shlok 27: "O, warrior bestowing an honour! Today in the concentrated fury that injustice has
kindled I shall scatter the enemy - battalions as a fire consumes the dry wood."

Shlok 28: "Today, with my sharpened arrows, I shall slay the bodies of my foes and make this
forest of Chitrakuta overflow with blood."

Shlok 29: "The elephants and horses whose breasts were laid open with my darts and the men too
struck down by me, be dragged about by savage beasts."

Shlok 30: "By killing Bharata together with his army in this great forest, I shall discharge
my debt to my bow and arrows."



SARGA 97
------------------------------

[Text] Rama pacifies Lakshmana, saying that Bharata, due to his affection towards his
brothers and due to the distress that troubles his mind after hearing of the news of their exile,
he came to the forest and not with any other motive. Ashamed of himself to hear the opinion of Rama
about Bharata, and descending the tree, Lakshmana hides his abashment by changing the topic.
Commanded by Bharata that no disturbance should be caused to the hermitage occupied by Rama, the
army encamps around the edge of the mountain, chitrakuta.

Shlok 1: Rama on the other hand, pacifying Lakshmana (son of Sumitra), who was very much
agitated and infatuated with anger, spoke the following words:

Shlok 2: "While Bharata, wieldin a bow and highly wise-man himself is coming here, what is
the use of a bow or sword with a shield?"

Shlok 3: "O, Lakshmana! Having promised to make our father's wish a reality. What shall I do
with the kingdom by acquiring an ill-fame in killing Bharata who came here to see me?"

Shlok 4: "I should not enjoy the spoils obtained by slaying a relative or friend, like the
partaking of a poisoned food."

Shlok 5: "O, Lakshmana! It is for your sake I desire virtue, legitimately acquired wealth and
pleasure or even the earth itself. I promise this to you."

Shlok 6: "O, Lakshmana! I desire the throne only for the protection and happiness of my
brothers. I touch my weapon and swear this fact."

Shlok 7: "This earth, bounded by the sea is not hard to obtain for me, O the excellent man! I
do not indeed wish even the position of Indra by unrighteousness."

Shlok 8: "If there be happiness that I could enjoy without Bharata or you or without
Shatrughna, may it be without Shatrughna, may it be burnt to ashes by fire, O the
honour-giver!"

Shlok 9-10-11: "I think Bharata was back to Ayodhya, with full of affection for his brothers. He is
dearer to me than my life- he who is mindful of the duties of his race. Hearing of my exile and
that I was wearing matted locks and the antelope skin, accompanied by Seetha and you, O most
valiant of warriors, in his devotion towards me and due to the distress that troubles his mind,
Bharata has come to see me. He has not come with any other motive."

Shlok 12: "Getting angry with Kaikeyi his mother and speaking unkind and harsh words to her,
the glorious Bharata after getting permission from our further, came here to bestow kingdom to
me."

Shlok 13: "This is the proper time for Bharata to come here and see us. He does not behave or
even think unkindly towards us."

Shlok 14: "Has Bharata at any time done any harm to you previously? What so the reason for you
to be so apprehensive of Bharata now?"

Shlok 15: "Indeed, Bharata must not hear harsh or disagreeable word from your lips. If an
affront is offered to him, it is offered to me!"

Shlok 16: "O, Lakshmana! How should a son strike his father, even in a distress or a brother
strike a brother who is as dear to him as his life?"

Shlok 17: "If you are uttering these words for the sake of the kingdom, I shall tell Bharata
to give the kingdom to you, when I see him."

Shlok 18: "O, Lakshmana! When Bharata receives this command from me, "Cede the empire to him",
he will answer, So, be it."

Shlok 19: At these words spoken by his honourable brother, to whom he was devoted, abashed,
shrank into himself.

Shlok 20: Listening to these words ashamed, answered: "I think that our father Dasaratha came
here to see you himself."

Shlok 21: Observing the emberassed , Rama said, "I think the mighty armed Dasaratha came here
to see us."

Shlok 22: "Or rather, to my mind, as he knows that we have been accustomed to comfort,
reflecting that we are dwelling in the forest, he wishes to take us home."

Shlok 23: "The glorious Dasaratha, my father possibly will take back Seetha from the forest,
she who has ever lived in the heart of prosperity."

Shlok 24: "O, warrior! See those two excellent horses of noble breed, shining attractively and
vying with the wind in swiftness."

Shlok 25: "Here is that colossal elephant who is moving at the head of the army called
Shatrunjaya, the aged companion of our sagacious father."

Shlok 26: "O, the mighty armed! But I do not see that white heavenly canopy of our father,
well known insignia in the world. An apprehension on this point is created in my mind."

Shlok 27: "O, Lakshmana! You get down from the top of the tree. Act on my word." Thus spoke
the virtuous Rama to that Lakshmana.

Shlok 28: Descending from the top of that Sala tree, Lakshmana the victorious in battle, with
joined palms, stood by the side of Rama.

Shlok 29: Commanded by Bharata that no trampling of army should be made in the hermitage of
Rama, the army was encamped round the mountain.

Shlok 30: That royal army of Ikshvaku race, crowded with elephants horses and chariots was
encamped around the edge of the mountain occupying an area of one Yojana and a half.

Shlok 31: Brought by the virtuous Bharata, who laid aside his arrogance, placing the
righteousness in forefront in order to propitiate Rama, that army showed itself to be disciplined
in the vicinity of Chitrakuta.



SARGA 98
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata instructs Shatrughna and Guha along with some troops each to search for Rama
and Lakshmana in the forest. Bharata, personally, along with his ministers citizens and priests,
proceed on foot to some other side of the forest for the search. He goes through the forest for
some time. Climbing up a sala tree, Bharata observes a plume of smoke at a distance and conjectures
that place as Rama's hermitage. Bharata quickly proceeds with quick steps, along with Guha, to see
Rama.

Shlok 1: After encamping the army, the mighty Bharata the excellent among men, sought to
approach on foot, Rama who was complying with the words of his father.

Shlok 2: Soon after encamping the army in a well-behaved manner per the guidelines, Bharata
spoke the following words to Shatrughna:

Shlok 3: "O, gentle brother! You, along with a troop of men and trackers, ought to search on
all sides of this forest."

Shlok 4: "Let Guha search for Rama and Lakshmana in this forest, himself accompanied by a
multitude of his kinsmen, duly wielding their bows, arrows and swords."

Shlok 5: "I too, surrounded by the ministers, citizens, priests and Brahmanas; shall
personally go round the entire forest on foot.

Shlok 6: "Peace will not be with me until I do not see Rama or the very mighty Lakshmana or
the illustrious Seetha."

Shlok 7: "Peace will not be with me until I do not see the auspicious face of my elder
brother, resembling the moon and having eyes bearing resemblance to lotus-leaves.

Shlok 8: "Peace will nt be with me until I do not hold firmly on my head, the soles of my
elder brother, bearing royal insignia.

Shlok 9: "Peace will not come to me until my elder brother, who is eligible for the crown, is
not installed in the kingdom of Ayodhya, which was derived from our father and grand father and
consecrated by sprinkling water on his head (as a symbol of crowing the kingdom)."

Shlok 10: "Lakshmana, who is seeing regularly the face of Rama having a great luminance
resembling the bright moon and having lotus eyes, is indeed an accomplished man."

Shlok 11: "Seetha, the illustrious daughter of Janaka, who is following the steps of Rama the
Lord of the earth extending to the sea, has fulfilled her object."

Shlok 12: "That enchanting mountain of Chitrakuta resembles the King of Mountains on which
Rama is residing, as Kubera the Lord of riches is living in the garden of Nandana."

Shlok 13: "Blessed is this dense forest, inhabited by wild animals, where Rama, the great
warrior and the excellent man among the wielders of weapons, dwells."



SARGA 99
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata observes various signs, proving Rama's hermitage in the vicinity of his
place of search. After proceeding for a distance, Bharata beholds Rama's hermitage and Rama too
seated in the hut, wearing matted locks. Bharata laments on Rama's misfortune of living as an
ascetic Bharata and Shatrughna throw themselves on Rama's feet in salutation. Rama embraces them
both.

Shlok 1: Having stationed his forces, Bharata set out eagerly to see his brother, pointing
out the sign of Rama's habitation to Shatrughna.

Shlok 2: Bharata, who was affectionate towards the elders, asked the sage Vasishta to bring
his mothers soon thereafter and went ahead quickly.

Shlok 3: Sumantra also, equally desirous of seeing Rama; followed Shatrughna at a little
distance.

Shlok 4: While the illustrious Bharata passed on, he observed in that wood of ascetics, a
leafy hut of his brother together with a small hut made of leaves, nearby.

Shlok 5: Bharata then beheld wood that had been broken up and heaps of flowers gathered in
front of that hermitage.

Shlok 6: While coming to the hermitage, Bharata saw some signs here and there serving as a
proper direction to that hermitage, tufts of Kusha grass and strips of bark tied to the trees by
Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 7: Bharata also saw in the vicinity great heaps of dried dung of deers and buffaloes,
kept ready for protection against cold.

Shlok 8: Then, proceeding further, the valiant and the mighty armed Bharata spoke to
Shatrughna in joy, as also those ministers who surrounded him.

Shlok 9: "I think we have reached the place about which Bharadwaja directed us. I believe
Mandakini River is not far from here."

Shlok 10: "These pieces of bark have been tied up from above. This may be the path provided as
signs by Lakshmana in order to find his way back in odd hours of darkness."

Shlok 11: "At the side of the mountain, this is a roaming place of elephants, having huge
teeth, violent as they are and ferociously roaring at each other."

Shlok 12: "See this intense smoke coming from that fire which the sages in the forest always
desire to keep in their hermitages."

Shlok 13: "Here, I can see joyfully Rama, the tiger among men, who gives respect to elders and
is as venerable as a sage."

Shlok 14: Proceeding for a while on Chitrakuta mountain and reaching the River Mandakini, that
Bharata said to his ministers and others as follows:

Shlok 15: "The foremost of men and the Lord of the people, having sought seclusion, sat on the
floor, delighted as he was in the posture of a hero (with his left foot placed on his right knee).
O Fie unto my birth and life!"

Shlok 16: "Rama the Lord of Men with great luster, has been overtaken by this misfortune
because of me and leaving all enjoyments, is living in the forest."

Shlok 17: "Thus abhhored by the world, I will fall on the feet of Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana
and seek to regain Rama's grace."

Shlok 18-19-20-21-22-23: As Bharata was lamenting thus, he beheld in that forest, a splendid and sacred leafy
hut, which was covered with many soft leaves of Sala, Tala and Asvakarna trees, overspread with
blades of Kusa grass in a sacrificial performance, appearing like an extensive altar and it was
adorned with bows plated with gold, like unto the weapons of Indra the Lord of celestials,
constructed for heroic exploits, having great power, the torments of their foes, graced with
fearful arrows in their quivers, like unto the rays of the sun, bright as serpents with shining
hoods, in the same way of Bhagavati (the realm of Nagas), decked with a couple of swords encased in
sheaths of gold, adorned with two shields decorated with flowers of gold, finger-guards embroidered
with gold and in different colours suspended on walls and which hut was unassailable by hordes of
enemies as is a lion's cave to deer.

Shlok 24: Bharata saw a sacrificial altar in the north-east corner having a steep descent,
extensive in area and having a sacred fire burned in the hermitage of Rama.

Shlok 25: Looking around for a moment, Bharata beheld his elder brother, Rama himself seated
in the hut, wearing matted locks.

Shlok 26- 27- 28: Bharata saw that Rama clad in an antelope-skin and robes of bark, seated close by,
resembling a fire (in brilliance), with the neck and shoulders of a lion, mighty arms and eyes
resembling the lotus, the very virtuous Lord of the Earth extending upto the ocean, the Eternal
Brahma, and seated on the ground spread with Darbha grass, with Seetha and Lakshmana.

Shlok 29: Beholding him, the illustrious and the high-souled Bharata the son of Kaikeyim
distraught by the grief that possessed him, rushed towards Rama.

Shlok 30: On seeing his brother, Bharata broke into lamentations and in a voice strangled with sobs, unable to restrain his agony with firmeness, said:

Shlok 31: "My elder brother who is fit to be honoured in an assembly by a body of ministers
around him, is now being served by a body of wild beasts around him in this jungle."

Shlok 32: "That magnanimous hero, who formerly used to possess countless articles of apparel
is now wearing two antelope-skins, following ascetic righteousness.

Shlok 33: "How this Rama, who used to wear various kinds of colourful flowers, is bearing this
burden of matted locks now?"

Shlok 34: "He who acquired merit through countless sacrifices performed according to the
prescribed injunctions, now follows the path of righteousness through asceticism!"

Shlok 35: "He whose body was formerly rendered fragrant by white sandal paste, has only dust
with which to smear the limbs of this venerable elder brother!"

Shlok 36: "Rama who used to have happiness, has fallen into this misfortune, because of me
cursed be my reprehensive existence that the whole world condemns!"

Shlok 37: Thus did that pitiable Bharata lament, perspiration be-dewing his lotus-like
countenance and, without touching Rama's feet, fell down grooming.

Shlok 38: Overcome with grief, the highly valiant prince Bharata cried out "O, Noble One!"
once and in his distress, was unable to speak anything further.

Shlok 39: Crying at the top of his voice, "O, Noble One" only, on seeing the illustrious Rama,
he was unable to speak further, his throat choked with tears.

Shlok 40: Shatrughna too, weeping, threw himself at Rama's feet and Rama too, embracing them
both, allowed his tears to fall.

Shlok 41: Then, in that forest, the princes Rama and Lakshmana were seen by Sumantra and Guha,
as in the sky, the sun and the moon are seen in conjunction with Venus and Jupiter.

Shlok 42: All those dwellers in the woods, seeing those princes resembling leaders of
elephant-herbs meeting together there in that great forest, losing their cheerfulness, began to
shed tears.



SARGA 100
------------------------------

[Text] Rama gives instruction to Bharata as regards the duties of a king and the polity
under an ideal monarchy under the pretext of enquiring about the welfare of his father and
others.

Shlok 1: Rama saw Bharata, with matted locks, wearing bark-robes and, with joined palms,
lying on the ground, incapable of being seen as the sun at the time of the dissolution of the
world.

Shlok 2: Rama recognized with some difficulty his brother Bharata, whose face became pale and
who was emaciated, and took him by the arm.

Shlok 3: Smelling the crown of his head, placing him on his lap, Rama who was born in Raghu
dynasty embraced Bharata and with an absorbent mind, enquired of him as follows:

Shlok 4: "My darling! Where is our father, that you have come to the forest? He, being alive,
you ought not have to come to the forest."

Shlok 5: "I see you after a long time, coming from a far-off distance, wearing a mournful
face into this forest Alas! Why have you come to the forest, my darling?"

Shlok 6: "My dear brother! Is the king alive, that you have come here? I hope the miserable
king has not indeed departed to the other world, all of a sudden."

Shlok 7: "O, gentle brother! I hope the eternal kingdom has in a no way suffered from your
youthful experience. My darling! Are you rendering service to our father, who is truly
valiant?"

Shlok 8: "I hope that the King Dasaratha is well, he who is true to his promise, he who
performs Rajasuya and Ashvamedha Sacrifices and he who has a righteous resolve."

Shlok 9: "My darling! Are you treating respectfully as before that preceptor of the
Ikshvakus, the one who knows the sacred scriptures, the one who knows the sacred scriptures, the
learned who constantly keep up the virtues and he who has a great splendour?"

Shlok 10: "My darling! I hope that Kausalya and Sumitra having good offspring are happy. I
hope the venerable queen Kaikeyi is rejoicing."

Shlok 11: "I hope that the preceptor (Suyajgna the son of Vasishta); who is rich in humility,
a son of a noble family, who has a knowledge of many scriptures an unenvious person and who is full
of insight, is duly honoured by you."

Shlok 12: "I hope that a brahmin who is versed in the traditions, who is intelligent and just,
employed in your sacred fires, always informs you in time, about a sacrificial fire having been or
going to be fed with oblations."

Shlok 13: "My darling! I hope that you are holding in high esteem the gods, your ancestors,
dependents and teachers of your father's age the doctors and the brahmins."

Shlok 14: "O, my darling! I hope that you treat with due respect; Sudhanva, your teacher in
archery, who is furnished with the most excellent arrows and darts and well-versed in political
economy."

Shlok 15: "I hope that ministers who are valiant like you, learned, masters of their senses of
noble birth and skilled interpreting internal sentiments by external gesture, are assigned to
you."

Shlok 16: "The source of victory for kings indeed comes from a concealed counsel by ministers,
who are well-versed in political sciences and who can hide their thoughts within themselves."

Shlok 17: "I hope you do not fall a prey to excess of sleep and do wake up at appropriate
time. I hope you contemplate during the later half of the night, about the adroitness of an
action."

Shlok 18: "I hope that you do not deliberate alone nor indeed with numerous men. I hope your
decision arrived at by you through such deliberation does not flow to the public (even before it is
carried out)".

Shlok 19: "O, Bharata! I hope considering your interest fully, you lanuch an undertaking,
which has maximum benefit with minimum coast and indeed do not delay it further."

Shlok 20: "I hope the other kings know your entire undertakings only after they have been
successfully completed as well as those which have taken a shape, but not your proposed
undertakings."

Shlok 21: "My darling! I hope that others are not knowing, by their enquiries or strategies or
by any other approaches not mentioned, the details of discussions you make with your
ministers."

Shlok 22: "I hope you solicit for one wise man rather than for a thousand stupids for, a wise
man can be of a great help to you in difficult matters."

Shlok 23: "Even if a king employs thousands or tens of thousands of fools, they will not be
helpful to him."

Shlok 24: "Even one wise, valiant sagacious and efficient minister alone can cause to secure a
great prosperity to the king or to one who enjoys royal authority."

Shlok 25: "I hope that superior servants are assigned superior works only, mediocre servants
in mediocre works and inferior servants in inferior works."

Shlok 26: "I hope you are appointing those ministers, who are eminent incorruptible, born of
the fathers and for bears of good family and who are full of integrity in matters of great
importance."

Shlok 27: "O, Bharata! I hope your ministers do not watch as mere witnesses, while your
subjects in the kingdom wielding tremble with great fear, under your inflexible wielding of the
scepter."

Shlok 28: "I hope those who perform the sacrifice do not hold you in contempt, as one who
accepts terrible gifts; as one who is fallen, as women hold in contempt of those highly lustful
men."

Shlok 29: "He, who does not slay a physician skilled in ways and means of aggravating a
disease, a servant intent on bringing disgrace and a valiant warrior seeking kingly power, is
*himself) slain by them."

Shlok 30: "I hope an army-chief, who is cheerful, wise, courageous, valiant, well-behaved,
born in a good family, who is beloved by his subordinates and efficient, is selected by you."

Shlok 31: "I hope those warriors, who are excellent strong, skilled in war-face, whose
excellent actions were seen before and the most courageous ones are duly honoured and respected by
you."

Shlok 32: "I hope you are regularly giving your army, the daily provisions and the suitable
salary to them, without any delay."

Shlok 33: "When there is delay in giving bread and wages, the servants become incensed against
their master and become corrupt; and that is said to be a great unfortunate occurrence."

Shlok 34: "I hope all the foremost descendents of your race (kshatriyas) are devoted to you
and do they lay down their lives steadfastly for your sake?"

Shlok 35: "I hope that a knowledgeable man, living in your own country, a wise man a skilled
person endowed with presence of mind and the one who knows how to speak to the point, is selected
as an ambassador by you."

Shlok 36: "Do you get to know throught three spies, each unacquainted with each other, about
the eighteen* functionaries of the enemies and the fifteen functionaries of your own side?"

[Commentary] *They are: 1)the chief minister; 2) the king's family priest; 3)the crown
prince; 4)the leader of the army; 5) the chief warder; 6) the chamberlain (antaHpuraaH adhyaksha);
7)the superintendent of gails (kaaraagaara adhyaksha); 8) the chancellor of the exchequer; 9)the
herald; 10)the government advocate; 11) the judge; 12)the assessor; 13) the officer disbursing
salaries to army men; 14) the officer drawing money from the state exchequer to disburse the
workmen's wages; 15) the superintended of public works; 16) the protector of the borders of a
kingdom, who also performed the duties of a forester; 17) the magistrate; 18) the officer entrusted
with conservation of waters; hills, forests and tracts difficult of access.: The fifteen
functionaries of one's own side are the last fifteen of this very list, omitting the first three;
viz; the chief ministers, the family priest and the crown prince.

Shlok 37: "O, slayer of your Foes! I hope you do not forever think lightly of your foes, who
are weak and having been expelled, return again."

Shlok 38: I hope are not honouring the materialistic brahmins, My dear brother! These men are
skilled in perverting the mind, ignorant as they are and thinking themselves to be learned."

Shlok 39: "Reaching to their logical acumen, these men of perverted intellect preach
meaninglessly, in the presence of eminent books on righteousness."

Shlok 40- 41- 42: "I hope you preserve the City of Ayodhya, furnished with everything and flourishing,
that was formerly inhabited by our heroic ancestors, O my dear brother, that is worthy of its name,
with its fortified gates, its elephant horses and chariots that fill it, with its brahmins,
warriors and merchants in thousands, ever engaged in their respective duties, with its noble
citizens self-controlled and full of energy, with its palaces in various shapes and the learned who
abound there."

Shlok 43- 44- 45- 46- 47: I hope that the kingdom, adorned with peaceful places rich in temples and sheds
where water stored for distribution to passers-by in tanks, with happy men and women, graced by
social festivities, with land well-tilled, abiding in cattle which are totally free from cruelties,
the agricultural land not exclusively fed by rains, which is beautiful and is purged of beasts of
prey, which is completely rid of fears, studded with mines, a destitute of sinful men, and
well-protected by our fore-fathers, is prosperous and an abode of happiness.

Shlok 47: "Are you cherishing all those who live by agriculture and cattle-rearing, O, dear
borhter! The people living on agriculture and cattle-rearing indeed prosper well."

Shlok 48: "I hope their maintenance is being looked after by you, in providing what they need
and eschewing what they fear. All the citizens are indeed to be protected by a king through his
righteousness."

Shlok 49: "I hope you are pacifying the women well. Are they protected by you? I hope you are
not believing the words of these women and not telling them the secrets."

Shlok 50: "Are you supervising the woods inhabited by elephants? I hope female elephants are
there to you in good number. I hope you are not simply satisfied with the existing population of
female elephants, horses and male-elephants."

Shlok 51: "O, Prince! Do you, regally adorned, appear before the people on rising each
morning, on the great high way?"

Shlok 52: "I hope that all your servants, in your presence, do not adopt a disrespectful
attitude or on the other hand all of them do not hasten away on seeing you. Ofcourse, a middle
course only in the principle to be followed in this matter."

Shlok 53: "I hope all your citadels are quite full of money, grain, weapons, water and
mechanical contrivances as well as artisans and archers."

Shlok 54: "I hope your income is abundant and expenditure, minimum. I hope your treasure does
not reach undeserving people, O, Bharata!"

Shlok 55: "I hope that your expenditure goes for the cause of divinity, manes, brahmins,
unexpected visitors, soldiers and hosts of friends."

Shlok 56: "If one of noble work, despite his honesty and integrity, is falsely accused of some
offence, I hope he is not killed impatiently, without enquiry by those well-versed in
law-books."

Shlok 57: "O, foremost of men! If a thief is seen and even caught at the time of his act on
sufficient ground and interrogated-I hope, he is not released from greed of wealth."

Shlok 58: "O, Bharata! I hope that your well-educated ministers examine a case dispassionately
when a contention occurs between a rich man and a poor man, after studying the situation
carefully."

Shlok 59: "The tears fallen from those who are the victims of false accusations, O Bharata,
destroy their sons and herds of those who are indifferent to justice, merely for the sake of
pleasure."

Shlok 60: "I hope that you seek to conciliate by the following three means, viz. gifts, a
loving mind and polite words- the aged, the children and the foremost physicians."

Shlok 61: "I hope you greet your teachers, the elderly, the ascetics, the deities; the
unexpected visitors, the trees standing at cross roads and all the brahmins of auspicious life and
conduct."

Shlok 62: "I hope you do not abrogate virtue by your excessive devotion to wealth or your
excessive devotion to wealth or your earthly interests by your over-emphasis on religion or both
your religious and secular interests by your self-indulgence in pleasure, greed and gratification
of the senses."

Shlok 63: "I hope your pursue wealth, religion and the delights of the sense dividing them all
according to time, O Jewel among the victorious, the one who is conversant with the proper time and
O, the bestower of boons!"

Shlok 64: "O, the one who is endowed with great wisdom! I hope that brahmins versed in the
knowledge of the scriptures, the inhabitants of town and the country pray for your happiness."

Shlok 65- 66- 67: Do you eschew the following fourteen for of kings -viz. atheism, falsehood, anger
carelessness, procrastination, disregard of the wise, sloth, bondage to the five senses, himself
alone devoting thought to the affairs of the state (without consulting the ministers); taking
counsel with those of perverted insight; failure to undertake the projects already decided, failure
to keep secrets, failure to utter auspicious words (at the beginning of an undertaking); and rising
from one's seat (indiscriminately) to receive all.

Shlok 68- 69- 70: "O, the very wise Bharata! I hope you understand the following and deal them
properly the ten evils(1); the five kinds of fortifications(2); the four expedients(3); the seven
limbs of state(4); the eight evils (born of anger) the three objects of human pursuit(5); the three
branches of learning(6) subjugation of the senses, the six strategic expedients(7); adversity

results? Do you benefit from the company of your consorts? Has your learning been fruitful?"

Shlok 73: "O, Bharata! I hope that your conviction, is the same as mentioned by me in the
foregoing verses, which is conducive to long life, fame, religious merit, enjoyment and
wealth."

[Text] Rama asks Bharata why he has come to the forest, wearing robes of bark and antelope
skin, abandoning Ayodhya kingdom. Bharata informs Rama about Dasaratha's death and requests Rama to
take over the kingdom, endowed to him as per succession. Rama says that since king Dasaratha
allotted two different duties to the two of them one enjoining the exile of his elder brother being
binding on him and the other bequeathing the kingdom to Bharata, they must be implicitly obeyed by
both of them.

Shlok 1: Rama along with Lakshmana, his younger brother, began to question Bharata, his
brother who was devoted to elders (as follows):

Shlok 2: "I desire to hear from you, why you have come tot his place in robes of bark and an
antelope-skin."

Shlok 3: "You ought to tell me all about the purpose for which you entered this place, clad
in deer-skin and matted hair, relinquishing the kingdom."

Shlok 4: Thus questioned by the high souled Rama, by closely embracing him again, Bharata
with joined palms answered as follows:

Shlok 5: "O, noble brother! Our father the mighty armed, after performing a deed must
difficult to perform, and having abandoned us has gone the divine region; he died of grief on
account of separation from his son."

Shlok 6: "O, tormented of foes! As urged by his wife and my mother Kaikeyi;, our father
committed this great sin that has taken away his own reputation."

Shlok 7: "Without having plucked the fruit of kingdom, widowed and emaciated with grief my
mother will fall into the most terrific hell."

Shlok 8: "Grant me, who am your true servant, a favour! This very day, as Indra the Lord of
celestials himself, receive the royal anointing!"

Shlok 9: "Grant all these people and these widowed Queens, who have come here to see you,
this felicity!"

Shlok 10: "O, Prince! For that reason, accept the throne that is befitting; endowed to you as
per succession and that is yours by right fulfill, as your should, the desires of your
friends."

Shlok 11: "Bring the widowhood of the entire world to an end by becoming her Lord, as does the
immaculate moon to the autumn-night."

Shlok 12: "Grant this grace to your brother, who prostrates at your feet along with your
ministers is both your discipline and your slave."

Shlok 13: "O, Tiger among men! You cannot disregard this unbroken kingdom, which is eternal,
ancestral and honoured."

Shlok 14: Thus speaking, the mighty armed Bharata, with tears, once again seized Rama's feet
in great honour, as per precept.

Shlok 15: Rama embraced his brother Bharata, who sighed again and again like an elephant in
rut, and spoke as follows:-

Shlok 16: "How should a man of noble birth, rich in Sattva (goodness), dignified and who has
observed sacred vows like myself, commit sin for the sake of a mere kingdom?"

Shlok 17: "O, Bharata the annihilator of enemies! I do not see the slightest fault in you and
you should not reproach your mother for a childish action."

Shlok 18: "O, Bharata the highly intelligent and the faultless man! It is incumbent always on
the part of the elders to act freely with reference to their wives and progeny."

Shlok 19: "O, gentle brother! Since it was said thus by virtuous men in this world, we should
all, women children and disciples, obey our Lord; this must be known to you."

Shlok 20: "The great king is the master, who has a discretion either to make me reside in the
forest, wearing bark robes and a black antelope skin or to sit on the throne, O gentle
brother!"

Shlok 21: "O, excellent among the supporters of law and the virtuous! The same degree of
respect is to be paid to our mother, as is due to our father, who is honoured by all."

Shlok 22: "How can I do otherwise, while both my parents of virtuous nature ask me to go to
the forest?"

Shlok 23: "It is for you to occupy the throne in Ayodhya that the world reveres and it is for
me to occupy this Dandaka forest, wearing bark robes."

Shlok 24: "Having commanded thus, the emperor Dasaratha with a great splendour, made the
division of duties in this manner (for us two) in the presence of the people and then ascended to
heaven."

Shlok 25: "That pious souled king, the preceptor of the world is the standard authority for
you and you have to enjoy the share given by our father accordingly."

Shlok 26: "I, for my part, shall enjoy the share given to me by our high-souled father for
fourteen years, taking my abode in Dandaka forest, O gentle brother!"



SARGA 102
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata replies that it is an established practice for the eldest son to become a
king and requests Rama to come to Ayodhya and get crowned in the kingdom for the welfare of
Ikshvaku race. Bharata requests Rama to offer traditional libations of water to their deceased
father, who died wtih the thought of Rama alone, absorbed in his mind.

Shlok 1: Hearing Rama's words, Bharata replied as follows: "What will the discharge of royal
duties amount to me, who is outside of that code?"

Shlok 2: "O, the foremost of men! O, Majesty! It has been ever the established tradition in
us that while the elder son is there, the younger one cannot become a king."

Shlok 3: "O, Rama! Therefore, come to the prosperous Ayodhya along with me and get anointed
in kingdom for the welfare of our race."

Shlok 4: "The king, whom people speak of as a human being and whose conduct is in conformity
with righteousness and worldly prosperity, they declare as super- human, is conceded by me as a
god-head."

Shlok 5: "While I was there in Kekaya kingdom and you had proceeded tot he forest, the king
Dasaratha, the revered one who was given to the performance of sacrifices and was honoured by the
virtuous, has gone to heaven."

Shlok 6: "Hardly were you gone with Seetha and Lakshmana, than the king succumbed to
misfortune and grief and ascended to the most sacred heaven."

Shlok 7: "Arise, O the Tiger among men! Let the traditional libations of water be offered to
our father. Shatrughna and I have previously done it."

Shlok 8: "O, Rama! It is said that the one given by an affectionate son becomes measureless
and you undoubtedly are beloved to our father."

Shlok 9: "Entirely abandoned by you, lamenting about you, desirous of beholding you, being
not able to turn away his mind absorbed in you alone, immersed in grief of you and recollecting
you, your father died."



SARGA 103
------------------------------

[Text] Rama fainted away, after hearing the news of his father's death and is brought back
to consciousness by Bharata and others who sprinkle water on him. Rama laments in various ways.
Bharata consoles him. Rama in turn consoles Seetha who is weeping. Rama painfully reaches the River
Mandakini, offers water and balls of food to the spirit of his departed father and returns to the
hut. The crying sounds of those brothers mourning for their dad father with Seetha created and echo
in the mountain. Hearing their cry of distress, the troops approach Rama, who receives them all
with affection.

Shlok 1: Hearing those mournful words relating to the death of his father, spoken by Bharata,
Rama fainted away.

Shlok 2- 3: Hearing that unpleasant thunder bolt of words spoken by Bharata, like a thunderbolt
released by Indra the Lord of celestials in a battle, Rama the tormentator of his enemies,
stretched forth his hands and fell on the ground, in the same manner as a tree covered at
extremities with blossoms was cut off by an axe in the forest.

Shlok 4- 5: Seeing Rama lying on the earth, has the lord of the earth, like an elephant crushed
by a land slide on a bank where he was sleeping, those brother along with Seetha approached him
from all sides and weepingly sprinkled water on him.

Shlok 6: Coming to his senses again and tears falling from his eyes, Rama began to speak much
plaintively.

Shlok 7: Hearing that the King and his father had ascended to heaven, the virtuous. Rama
spoke the following words, consistent with righteousness to Bharata.

Shlok 8: "What should I do with Ayodhya, now that my father reached the end of his life? Who
will rule that Ayodhya, which is bereft of that excellent king?

Shlok 9: "In my misfortune, what can I do for that high-souled one? He died of grief on my
account and I did not perform the last rites for him!"

Shlok 10: "O, Bharata the faultless one! Alas! Happy are you, by whom as well as by Shatrughna
the king was honoured by all obsequial rites!"

Shlok 11: 'Even after the end of my exile, I do not want to return to Ayodhya which is i a
disarranged state, deprived of a chief and made bereft of a king."

Shlok 12: "O, Bharata the tormentator of foes While our father has gone to the other world,
who will counsel me when my exile in the forest is over?"

Shlok 13: "Formerly, seeing my good conduct, our father used to address me in words of praise;
from whom now shall I hear those words delightful to the ears?"

Shlok 14: Having spoken thus to Bharata, Rama went to seek out his consort, whose face
resembled the full moon, and overwhelmed with grief, spoke to her as follows:-

Shlok 15: "O, Seetha! your father-in-law is dead. O, Lakshmana! You have become bereft of your
father. Bharata is informing a sorrowful news of the emperor being dead.

Shlok 16: While Rama was uttering those words, copious tears caused to flow then from the eyes
of those sons of Dasaratha.

Shlok 17: Then, all those brothers consoled Rama very much and said to him, "Let us offer
libations of water for our father, the Lord of the earth."

Shlok 18: Hearing that her father-in-law, that great monarch had ascended to heaven, Seetha
was unable to see her husband through eyes filled with tears.

Shlok 19: Rama consoled that Seetha who was weeping and himself stricken with grief, spoke to
the lamenting Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 20: "Bring the crushed pulp of Ingudi Tree and bring a piece of bark for being wrapped
about my loins and another for being used as my loins and another for being used as an upper
garment, so that we may proceed to offer libations of water for our magnanimous father."

Shlok 21: "Let Seetha walk in the front and you follow after her nearby. I shall follow in the
rear. This indeed is the most terrible procession.

Shlok 22- 23: Then, their faithful companion Sumantra versed in the spiritual science, endowed
with great intelligence, kind, self-controlled and glorious, and deeply devoted to Rama, consoling
him and his brothers, took Rama by the hand and helped him descend to the auspicious River
Mandakini.

Shlok 24- 25: The illustrious Rama and others painfully reached the River Mandakini, that stream
of sacred fords, the enchanting one always covered with flowers, coming to a blessed ford, free
from mud and offered the lustrual water to the king, saying "Father! May this prove agreeable to
you."

Shlok 26: Holding together in the form of a hollow his palms full of water and turning his
face turned towards the southern quarter and weeping the great prince pronounced the traditional
words saying:

Shlok 27: O, Tiger among men! May this water without taint and incorruptible at the moment
that I offer it to you, reach you in the region of your ancestors where you are."

Shlok 28: Thereafter, the glorious Rama, resending the bank of Mandakini River along with his
brothers, offered balls of food to his father.

Shlok 29: Rama placed the pulp of the Ingudi tree mixed with the pulp of plums on a mat of
Kusa grass and overcome with sadness, weeping, spoke the following words:

Shlok 30: "O, Great King! Be pleased to partake of this, which we eat for, that which man
eats, is also consumed by his gods."

Shlok 31: Rama the tiger among men then re-ascending by the same path on the banks of the
river reached the charming summit of Chitrakuta mountain.

Shlok 32: Gaining the door of his leafy hut, Rama the Lord of the earth then embraced Bharata
and Lakshmana with his arms.

Shlok 33: From the sound of the cry of those brothers with Seetha, which resembled like the
roaring of lions rose an echo in the mountain.

Shlok 34: Hearing the tumultuous clamour by those mighty heroes as, weeping they completed the
libations of water to their father, Bharata's army got alarmed.

Shlok 35: Those troops of Bharata also said, "Assuredly, Bharata has joined Rama and this is a
great sound only of their wailing, as they mourn for their dead father."

Shlok 36: Leaving their tents all of them having but one thought, went running in the
direction of that sound instantly.

Shlok 37: Some went on their horses, some others on their elephants, some in their chariots
covered with ornaments while the youthful people went on foot.

Shlok 38: In their longing to see Rama, whose absence though recent, seemed so long a period
for them, the whole people ran towards the hermitage.

Shlok 39: Eager to see those brothers re-united there, they went hastily by various means of
transport, either by hoofed animals or by wheeled vehicles.

Shlok 40: Trodden by many vehicles, beasts and chariots, that land emitted a tumultuous noise,
as a sky during the conjunction of clouds.

Shlok 41: Frightened by that noise, the wild elephants, surrounded by female elephants,
perfuming the quarters with teh scent of their ichor, went to another wood from there.

Shlok 42: Boars, wolves and lions, buffaloes, snakes, monkeys, tigers, Gokarnas and Gavayas
(two distinctive species of deer) along with spotted deer felt frightened.

Shlok 43: The ruddy gooses, water-fowls, swans, Karandavas ( a sort of ducks), herons, male
cuckoos and cranes, utterly confused made it to various directions.

Shlok 44: The sky filled with birds that had been frightened by that noise and the earth
covered with men, both looked beautiful at that moment.

Shlok 45: Suddenly then, the people beheld the illustrious and the sinless Rama, sitting on
the bare earth.

Shlok 46: Abusing Kaikeyi and Manthara, those people turned up with their faces bathed in
tears. while approaching Rama.

Shlok 47: Seeing those people thus deeply afflicted their eyes suffused with tears, Rama
knowing what was right, embraced them like their father and mother.

Shlok 48: Rama embraced some men there, while some others offered salutations to him.
Approaching them on that occasion, the king's son received them all including his friends and
companions.

Shlok 49: The tumult of those magnanimous persons lamenting, resounded over the earth and in
the sky, reverberating through the mountain caves and in all quarters like the continuous beating
of drums.



SARGA 104
------------------------------

[Text] Preceded by Dasaratha's wives and others, Vasishta advances to the hermitage of
Rama. Kausalya, on the way, shows to her co-wives the balls of Ingudi fruit-pulp offered to the
spirits of Dasaratha by Rama on blades of Dabha grass, the raised spikes of which pointed towards
the south; along the bank of Mandakini River. Kausalya was stricken with anguish for her deceased
husband. Reaching the hermitage, both Rama and Lakshmana hold the feet of the Queens in salutation.
Kausalya feels sad at the fate of Seetha in the forest, when the latter touches her feet. Rama
holds the feet of his preceptor and takes his seat. Accompanied by his ministers, Bharata also sits
nearby.

Shlok 1: Eager to see Rama again, Vasishta approached that place, preceded by Dasaratha's
wives.

Shlok 2: The king's wives, while moving slowly towards River Mandakini, saw the ford there,
being frequented by Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 3: With a gloomy and emaciated face, filled with tears, Kausalya spoke to Sumitra and
other royal women (as follows):

Shlok 4: "This is the ford, located in the eastern region of the forest, frequented by
Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana, banished from the kingdom; those unfortunate persons of illustrious
exploits who have no country."

Shlok 5: "O, Sumitra! Lakshmana, your son always draws water himself from here unwearyingly
for the sake of my son."

Shlok 6: "Through engaged in an inferior act (of carrying water), your son is not to be
censured because all that service rendered to his brother is enjoined with virtues."

Shlok 7: "Your son too, who is not accustomed to such pains, will indeed be relived now of
this mean, wretched and laborious task."

Shlok 8: The large-eyed Kausalya observed a ball made of Ingudi pulp, which was placed by
Rama in honour of his father on the ground, on aheap of Darbha grass, the raised spikes of which
pointed towards the south.

Shlok 9: Seeing that ball of food placed on the ground by the unfortunate Rama for his
father, the Queen Kausalya spoke to all those wives of Dasaratha (as follows):

Shlok 10: "See this ball of food offered traditionally by Rama in honour of his father, the
high-souled Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku race."

Shlok 11: "I do not consider this offering as befitting for that great-souled king, who was
like unto a God and who lived amidst every pleasure."

Shlok 12: "How can that Lord of the earth, Dasartha, equal to the Lord of celestials and a
mighty man, having enjoyed the earth with its four quarters, the boundaries of which are the
oceans, eat a cake of Ingudi pulp?"

Shlok 13: "I do not consider any thing painful to me on earth than when Rama the man of
fortune offering a cake of Ingudi pulp to his father."

Shlok 14: "Seeing this offering, a cake of Ingudi pulp, of Rama to his father, why does my
heart not break into a thousand pieces with anguish?"

Shlok 15: "It indeed occurs to me that the saying among men that the food eaten by man is also
consumed by his Gods is true."

Shlok 16: Consoling Kausalya thus afflicted by grief, Kausalya's companions then proceeded
further and saw Rama in his hermitage, who resembled an Immortal driven out of Paradise.

Shlok 17: Beholding Rama bereft of all enjoyments, his mothers agonized as they were with
grief, emitted cries and allowed tears to flow.

Shlok 18: Rama, the tiger among men, true to his promise raised up and took hold of the
auspicious feet of all his mothers.

Shlok 19: Those large-eyed Queens, by means of their pleasantly touching soft fingers and
palms as well as charming hands, wiped the dust from Rama's back.

Shlok 20: Seeing all those mothers, the wailing Lakshmana too slowly paid obeisance devotedly
to them all by bowing to each in turn, immediately after Rama.

Shlok 21: All Dasaratha's wives manifested the same affection towards Lakshmana, who was born
of Dasaratha and exceedingly handsome, as they did to Rama.

Shlok 22: Then, the grief-stricken Seetha, her eyes filed with tears, also touched the feet of
her mothers-in-laws and stood before them.

Shlok 23: Kausalya embraced the miserable Seetha as a mother her daughter, she who was
emaciated because of her stay in the forest and afflicted with grief, and spoke the following
words:

Shlok 24: "How has the daughter of King Janaka, the daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha and
Rama's wife, fallen into such a wretched plight that she is living in a desolate forest?"

Shlok 25- 26: "O, Seetha! Seeing your face, like a lotus withered with heart or a faded lily or
gold defiled with dust or a moon hidden by the clouds, the fire of grief produced by the firewood
of adversity and existing in my mind burns me severely."

Shlok 27: While the sorrowful mother was speaking thus, Rama the elder brother of Bharata
approached Vasishta and took hold of his feet in salutation.

Shlok 28: Then, Rama holding the feet of that priest, who was equal of Agni the fire and
endowed with very great splendour, even as Indra the Lord of celestials would clasp the feet of
Brihaspati, sat down by his side.

Shlok 29: Then, after Rama and Vasishta sat, Bharata the pious man along with his counsellors,
the leading citizens, warriors and virtuous people seated himself at a lowel level at a proximity
to Rama.

Shlok 30: Seeing Rama in the garb of an ascetic, radiant in majesty, the extremely powerful
Bharata, paying obeisance to him with joined palms, then took his place in his presence, as the
devoted Indra the Lord of celestials sits before Brahma the Lord of creation.

Shlok 31: A highest curiosity arose in the minds of those worthy men (assembled there) as to
what persuasive words Bharata at that moment would utter, while addressing Rama, having offered
salutation and homage to him.

Shlok 32: That Rama endowed with truth and forbearance with Lakshmana who was bestowed with
magnanimity and the pious Bharata, surrounded by his companions, were as resplendent as the three
sacrificial Fires (known by the names of Garhapatya, Ahavamiya and Dakshina), accompanied by the
superintending priests.



SARGA 105
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata requests Rama to oblige him by accepting the kingdom of Ayodhya, being
offered by him back to Rama with the concurrence of Kaikeyi, eventhough bestowed on him by their
deceased father. Rama consoles Bharata, saying that death is inevitable for living beings and they
should not grieve for their deceased father. Rama asks Bharata to control his grief and go back to
Ayodhya to shoulder the burden of rulership there in order to the command of their deceased father
and that Rama himself would obey his father's command by staying back in the forest.

Shlok 1: While those lions among men amidst a host of friends were lamenting, that night
elapsed with a much difficulty.

Shlok 2: When the beautiful dawn broke, Rama's brothers along with their companions, having
made their offerings and recited their prayers on the banks of River Madakini, approached Rama.

Shlok 3: Sitting in silence, no one uttered a word. Bharata, on his part, amidst his
companions, addressed Rama as follows:

Shlok 4: "My mother has been consoled (by you) by giving this kingdom to me. I am giving back
that kingdom to you. Enjoy it without hindrance!"

Shlok 5: "As a dam breached by a great on-rush of water during a rainy season cannot be
repaired so easily, this great continent cannot be defended by any one other than you."

Shlok 6: "As a donkey cannot emulate the tempo of a horse, or an ordinary bird the movement
of Garuda (a kind of falcon), neither can I follow in your footsteps, O, Lord of the world!"

Shlok 7: "O, Rama! Know his life to be blessed forever, on whom others depend Life is,
however, difficult for him who depends on others for this life."

Shlok 8- 9- 10: "As a tree planted by a man may grow and with its great branches and immense trunk,
become inaccessible to a dwarf, yet though it may come to flowering, does not bear fruit, it yeilds
no pleasure for him. O, mighty armed! You ought to understand the import of theis simile and being
the distinguished Lord of all, may you guide us, your sevants!"

Shlok 11: "O, emperor, the conqueror of foes! May all behold you, shining resplendent on all
sides like the sun, seated on the throne!"

Shlok 12: "O, Rama! May the elephants, intoxicated with ichor be heard trumpeting on the
highway, when you do return and the women of the inner apartments rejoice, all happily joined
together."

Shlok 13: Hearing the words of Bharata, who was thus appealing to Rama, the various people of
the city in approbation, said "Excellent! Well said!"

Shlok 14: On seeing the illustrious and sorrowful Bharata thus lamenting, the prudent and
self-conposed Rama began to console him as follows:

Shlok 15: "Man is not able to do what he wills. He is not the Master A fixed form or name
drives him hither and thither."

Shlok 16: "All that is piled up, is finally disbursed. What rises, ends in a fall. Unio ends
in separation. Life ends in death."

Shlok 17: "How a ripe fruit does not fear for anything other than its falling, so also a man
once born, does not fear for anything other than his death."

Shlok 18: "As a house that is solidly contructed ultimately falls into decay, human being too
is subject to age and death."

Shlok 19: "The night that has passed, does not return and the buntiful River Yamuna just
marches on towards the all-sufficient abounding in water."

Shlok 20: "The pasing days and nights in this world quickly decrease the life-span of all
living being as in the summer, the rays of the sun dry up the water (in a pool)."

Shlok 21: "You grieve for yourself. Why do you grieve for another? Even while you stay at
home, or departed to another place, your life-span gets shortened."

Shlok 22: "Death walks just with us (as we walk) and sits with us (as we sit). Having
travelled a very long distance (with us), death returns along with us (as we return)."

Shlok 23: "When folds have appeared on limbs and hair have turned grey; on what expedient can
a man having got decayed with age, come back to the original splendour?"

Shlok 24: "People are deligted when the sun has risen and also when the day ends. But they are
not able to perceive the waning in their life-span."

Shlok 25: "Seeing the onset of season, people rejoice, as though it has come something newly.
But the succession of the seasons devours the life of being."

Shlok 26- 27: "As pieces of drift-wood floating on the ocean coe toghether for a span, so wives,
children, kinsmen wealth and property come together for a while and part with us. Their parting in
deed inevitable."

Shlok 28: "Here, no being can escape its destiny ( in the form of birth and death). For that
reason, the power to avert his own death does not ingrain in a man mourning for a dead person."

Shlok 29- 30: "As a caravan is passing on a road, one stationed at the way-side says, I too will
come behind you. In the same manner, we should inevitably follow the path taken by fathers and fire
fathers. Why a man who obtained that path, for which there is no return, distress himself.

Shlok 31: "While the age reshes on, without any return like a flowing river, one's self should
be emplyoed in a pursuit leading to blessedness. It is said that beings are meant to be happy?"

Shlok 32: "The king Dasaratha, our pious minded father performed almost all auspicious
sacrifices and paid plentiful sacrificial fees (to the officitaing preists and Brahmins) and went
to heaven."

Shlok 33: "Our father reached heaven because he maintained his servants properly, protected
his subjects and realised the taxes in the manner prescribed by scriptures from them."

Shlok 34: "Our father, the king Dasaratha obtained heaven because of his auspicious acts and
perfoming sacrifices involving heavy sacrificial fees."

Shlok 35: "Having perfomed many types of sacrifices, enjoying worldly pleasure abundantly and
having obtained a long and virtuous life, king Dasaratha reached heaven."

Shlok 36: "O, dear brother! King Dasaratha, our father who was treated with respect by all
virtuous men and who secured excellent life-span and enjoyments, is not to be pitied."

Shlok 37: "King Dasaratha, our father, having abandoned his worn-out human body, indeed has
attained the celstial state, by which he can stroll in the realm of Brahma (the highest
heaven).

Shlok 38: "No wise, learned and exceptionally clever man, would weep in such a manner, such as
I and you, about the emperor.

Shlok 39: "The wise, who are steadfast, should indeed relinquish these sorrows, lamentatious,
weepings and such other states of misery."

Shlok 40: "Be composed, O Most eloquent of orators! Control your grief, return to the City of
Ayodhya in order to obey the command of our father, the subduer of his senses."

Shlok 41: "I also will fulfil the command of our father, the venrable man in that very place,
whre I have been ordered to stay by that king Dasaratha of virtuous deeds."

Shlok 42: "O Bharata the Vanquisher of Foes! It is not justifiable for me to violate the
command of our father. You also must honour it to the end, for it comes from our father, out own
blood."

Shlok 43: "O, Bharata! Hence, I shall conform to the honourable word of our father, the
practiser of virtue, by my act of dwelling in the forest."

Shlok 44: O, Tigher among men! Thus should a pious man act, who seeks to harm none, who is
obedient to his elders and who aspires to conquer the higher world."

Shlok 45: "O, excellent among men! perceiving the virutous conduct of our father, the King
Dasaratha, act in conformity to your own nature."

Shlok 46: Having uttered in about an hour, these meaningful words in this manner to his
younger brother on the need of abedience to his father's will, the magnamous and the mighty Rama
became silent.



SARGA 106
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata requests Rama, giving various reasons, to accept the throne of Ayodhya. He
abuses his deceased father for having transgressed the righteousness merely for a fear of wrath
from Kaikeyi and requests Rama to reverse that transgression of righteousness. Bharata takes a vow
not to return to Ayodhya but to continue to stay in the forest in case Rama did not heed to his
request. Rama's mothers also join Bharata and urge Rama to grant his request, when they find Rama
lukewarm in the matter and insistent on implementing the words of his deceased father.

Shlok 1: When Rama thus kept silent after uttering those meaningful words as aforesaid, the
pious Bharata for his part addressed to virtuous Rama who was fond of people conformable to justice
at the banks of that River Mandakini.

Shlok 2- 3: "Who, in this world, is endowed with such qualities like you, O annihilator of
enemies! Neither does sorrow disturb you nor does joy enrapture you. You are highly honoured by
elders and you clarify your doubts from them.

Shlok 4: "By what should he be moved, who looks on life and death, misfortune or prosperity
with an equal eye?"

Shlok 5: "O, King! He who knows the totality of time as you do, ought not to feel despondent
even on meeting with adversity."

Shlok 6: "O, the magnanimous Rama! you are equally strong as celestials. You are true to your
promise, all-knowing, all-viewing and endowed with understanding."

Shlok 7: "Even the most fearful calamity ought not to attack you, endowed as you are, with
such attributes; and recognising the birth and end of all beings."

Shlok 8: "The sinful deed, committed by my mean mother for my sake during my absence, was not
to my liking. (Hence) be gracious to me."

Shlok 9: "I am bound by the chanins of morality. For that reason, I do not kill iwth a severe
punishment, my mother who was of perverse conduct and worthy of retribution."

Shlok 10: "How can I, born of Dasaratha of noble birth and deeds and conversant of right and
wrong, do the most wicked and horrible act?"

Shlok 11: "The King Dasaratha was my preceptor, had several sacrificial performances to his
credit was aged, was my father, equal to a deity and is now dead. Hence, I cannot reproach him in
an open assembly."

Shlok 12: "O Rama the knower of piety! What man who knows the principles of righteousness,
would commit such an improper act, bereft of one's interest and duty, in order just to please a
woman?"

Shlok 13: "There is an ancient saying that at the time of death, beings lose their judgment.
The king, acting as he did, has made this saying indeed true in the eyes of the world."

Shlok 14: "This transgression of righteousness was done by our father for fear of anger (of
kaikeyi) or through infatuation and over-haste. You do keep in view a noble purpose and reverse
that transgression."

Shlok 15: "A son who honours only a good deviation (from righteousness) of a father is
accepted as a real son in this world. He who acts otherwise than this would be facing a quite
reverse situation."

Shlok 16: "You be that real son. Do not lend yourself to the infamous act, committed by our
father, which in this world, confident men freely condemn."

Shlok 17: "Save Kaikeyi and me, our father, our friends, our relatives, all the urbanites and
the villagers as well as the entire kingdom."

Shlok 18: "Where is the forest and where is the princely dignity? Where is the matted hair and
where is the protection of a kingdom? You ought not to do such a contradictory act."

Shlok 19: "O, the highly enlightened hero! The first duty of a warrior is indeed to get
crowned, so that he may then protect his subjects."

Shlok 20: "Which man of warrior-caste would set aside his manifest duty and prctise a virtue
that gives doubtful result, which does not promise happiness, which has a mental restraint and
which is uncertain?"

Shlok 21: "If you desire to pursue a virtue alone; although born of pain, then take pains
while protecting the four castes as per tradition, by recourse to righteousness."

Shlok 22: "O, Rama the knower of righteousness! The knower of what is right indeed tell that
the life of a house-holder is the noblest of all the four* stages of life. How can you abandon
it?"

[Commentary] *Four Stages of life Brahmacherya (student-life); Garhasthya (life of a
house-holder); Vanaprastha (life of a hermit); Sannyaasa (Life of an ascetic).

Shlok 23: "I am indeed junior to you in the point of learning, situation and by birth. How
should I rule the earth, while still you are living?"

Shlok 24: "I, a mere child, who am devoted of intelligence and virtues besides placed in an
inferior position, cannot even live without you."

Shlok 25: "O, Rama the knower of righteousness! Rule this entire kingdom belonging to your
father, without distraction, without hindrance and as per the conduct prescribed for you along with
your relatives."

Shlok 26: "Let all the king's ministers along with Vasishta and other priests well-versed in
sacred formulas, crown you, the knower of sacred texts, here itself."

Shlok 27: "You, having been crowned thus, may proceed to Ayodhya along with us to rule it,
like Indra the Lord of celestials, having conquered all the worlds with his might, proceeds to his
kingdom along with celestials."

Shlok 28: "You shall discharge the three obligations subdue all the enemies, gratify the
wishes of all your friends and you alone rule me in Ayodhya."

[Commentary] Three obligations to the Gods, the Ancestors and Brahmins.

Shlok 29: "O, noble brother! May your friends rejoice today at your enthronement. May your
enemies, full of terror, flee today to the ten quarters."

Shlok 30: "O, excellent among men! Wipe off my mother's curse today and protect our venerable
father from his sin."

Shlok 31: "I request you by bowing my head before you. Show compassion on me and on all our
relatives as Lord Shiva ( the Supreme Deity) on all beings."

Shlok 32: "Else if you disregard my entire request and move again into the forest form here, I
too will go along with you."

Shlok 33: Even while being propitiated by Bharata as above, by bowing his head duly sinking in
his spirit, the illustrious Rama, the Lord of the earth was still abiding in the words of his
father and did not feel inclined to return to Ayodhya.

Shlok 34: Seeing that wonderful staunchness in Rama, the people of Ayodhya felt sorrowful and
at the same time, experienced joy. They became distressed that he was not going to Ayodhya and felt
rejoiced to see his firmness of resolve.

Shlok 35: The priests, citizens and elders of that multitude as well as Queens, distracted and
weeping bitterly, acclaimed Bharat who was then speaking thus, duly prostrating himself before Rama
and added theri supplications to Rama.



SARGA 107
------------------------------

[Text] Rama reveals to Bharata that Kaikey's marriage, stating that Dasaratha would confer
the kingdom as a marriage-dowry. Rama also adds that Kaikeyi also received the promise of two boons
from Dasaratha as a token of his pleasure and gratitude for the help Kaikeyi rendered during the
conflict long ago between gods and demons. Rama further informs Bharata that according to that
promise, Kaikeyi asked for the two boons, one for Bharata's throne and another for his own exile to
the forest. Rama requests Bharata to make Dasaratha's promises true and asks him to return to
Ayodhya and assume its rulership.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, the illustrious Rama, highly respected among his fraternity, (as
follows) to Bharata who was speaking as aforesaid among his relatives.

Shlok 2: "These words, which you have spoken are worthy of you, the son of Dasaratha the
excellent king, born through Kaikeyi."

Shlok 3: "O, My brother! Long ago, when our father married your mother, he promised your
maternal grandfather that he would confer his kingdom as an exceptional marriage-dowry"

Shlok 4: "Thereafter, in a conflict between Gods and demons, your mother received the promise
of two boons from the efficient lord of the earth, King Dasartha, as a token of his joy and
gratitude."

Shlok 5- 6: "O, Tiger among men! Your illustrious mother of beautiful complexion consequently
demanded these two boons from that cheif of men, for you the throne and for me the exile to the
forest."

Shlok 7: "O, excellent among men! I too, have been enjoined by our aforesaid father to live
here in the forest for fourteen years, in accord iwth granting of boon."

Shlok 8: "I as such, without any rival, have come to this lonely forest accompanied by
Lakshmana and Seetha in order to carry out the promise given by our father."

Shlok 9: "You too ought, likewise, to make our father, as a person having given a true
promise, O Indra (the Lord of Celestials) among kings, by getting yourself anointed to the crown
without any delay.

Shlok 10: "O, Bharata! For my sake relieve the mighty king from his vow and make both our
mother and fahter happy."

Shlok 11: "My dear brother! Formerly, an illustrious king named Gaya, while perfoming a
sacrifice in a place called Gaya in honour of his ancestors, chanted the following verse:

Shlok 12: "Since a son delivers his father from a place of torment (hell) called 'Put', he is
named as 'Putra'- 'he who delivers his ancestors from all dangers'"

Shlok 13: "To have many virtuous and learned sons is to be desired, since one, atleast among
them, who is intimately connected will ocme to Gaya to perform a sacrifice."

Shlok 14: "O, prince! This is the conviction of all the royal sages. O, the efficient and the
excellent of men! Therefore, save our father from hell.

Shlok 15: "O, the valiant Bharata! Go to Ayodhya along with Shatrughna and all the Brahmanas
and give joy to the people there."

Shlok 16: "O, King! I too, without delay, will proceed to Dandaka forest along with Seetha and
Lakshaman."

Shlok 17: "O, Bharata! You become the Lord of men. I will become the emperor of the wild
beasts of the forest! Return now to the excellent city of Ayodhya full of joy and I also full of
joy will enter Dankada Forest!"

Shlok 18: "O, Bharata! Let the (royal) white umbrella provide a cool shadow for your head,
repulsing the rays of sunlight. I will take shelter comoftably under the abundant shadow of these
forest-trees."

Shlok 19: "O, Bharata! The wise Shatrughna is helpful to you. Lakshmana is known to be an
outstanding friend for me. We, the four excellent sons, will ultimately make the king true to his
promise. Do not get disappointed."



SARGA 108
------------------------------

[Text] A Brahmana named Jabali tries to persuade Rama to accept the kingdom by advocating
the theory of Nastikas (non-believers), saying that he need not get attached to his father's words
and remain in the troublesome forest. Jabali requests Rama to enjoy the royal luxuries, by
accepting the crown.

Shlok 1: A brahmana called Jabali spoke the following unrighteous words to Rama, who knew
righteousness and who was assuaging Bharata as aforesaid

Shlok 2: "Enough, O Rama! Let not your wisdom be rendered void like a common man, you who are
distinguished for your intelligence and virtue."

Shlok 3: "Who is related to whom? What is there to be obtained by anything and by whom? Every
creature is born alone and dies alone."

Shlok 4: "O, Rama! He who clings to another, saying, 'This is my father, this is my mother,
he should be known as one who has lost his wits. There is none who belongs to another."

Shlok 5- 6: "O, Rama! As one who passes the a strange village spends the night the and the next
day leaves that place and continues his journey, so are mother, father, home and possessions to a
man; they are but a resting place. The wise do not become attached to them".

Shlok 7: "O, chief of men! You as such should not abandon your father's kingdom in order to
dwell in a lonely forest, that is excruciating hard to traverse and full of thorny thickets."

Shlok 8: "Get yourself crowned in the prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya. That city is waiting for
you, with your locks duly unfound."

Shlok 9: "O, prince! Enjoy the royal luxuries worthy of you. Move around in Ayodhya as Indra
the Lord of celestials does in heaven!"

Shlok 10: "Dasaratha is none to you nor you in anyway to him. That king is another and your
are another. Hence, do what is told by me?"

Shlok 11: "The father is only the seed of a being. The sperm and the ovum blend at the right
time in the mother's womb, so that a human being is born in this world."

Shlok 12: "The king has gone, where he had to go. This is the fate of all being unnecessarily,
you are still frustrated over the matter."

Shlok 13: "I pity all those whosoever, devoted to wealth and religious merit, not other (who
are devoted to sense-enjoyment), for, they, having undergone suffering in this life, have met with
extermination after death."

Shlok 14: "These people say, 'The eighth day should be given up to sacrifices for the spirits
of our ancestors.' See the waste of food. What will a dead man eat?"

Shlok 15: "If food eaten by one here, reaches another's body, then let a sacrifice be offered
for those who are setting out on a distant journey. Will it not become a food on their path?"

Shlok 16: "Perform sacrifices, distribute gifts, consecrate yourselves, practise ansterity and
renunciation' - These writings are composed by learned men for the sake of inducing others to
give."

Shlok 17: "O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond
this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our
knowledge."

Shlok 18: "Honour the judgment of the wise and regarding that which is approved by all, accept
the kingdom as propitiated by Bharata."



SARGA 109
------------------------------

[Text] Rama refutes the atheistic arguments of Jabali and enunciates the importance of
truthfulness. He states that truth is God and all virtues follow truthfulness. Rama further adds
that there is nothing higher than truth. He announces that he wants to fulfil the command of is
father, who was a devotee of truth and stay back in the forest. Jabali replies that just for the
sake of convincing Rama to return to Ayodhya, he has spoken the words of a non-believer.

Shlok 1: After hearing Jabali's words, Rama the best among virtuous and upright men spoke
with a great devotion and with an undisturbed mind of his own (as follows);

Shlok 2: "That which, in your desire to please me, you have counselled, is impossible though
it appears to be possible. It is like a forbidden food, appearing to be an agreeable one."

Shlok 3: "He who is unruly, fully invested with ill-conduct, having a bad reputation and
seeing differences in everything, does not gain respect from honest men."

Shlok 4: "One's conduct itself explains whether one belongs to a good family or a bad family,
valiant or arrogant and chaste or unchaste."

Shlok 5- 6- 7: "What sensible man, able to discern what is just and what is unjust, in this world,
would respect me, if I am ignoble resembling as noble, bereft of honesty, impure, having no good
qualities but appearing like the one having good qualities, ill-behaved but appearing as
well-behaved abandoning righteousness and getting hold of unrighteousness in the guise of piety,
creating confusion in the world and disregarding rules of conduct."

Shlok 8: "If I behave in this manner faithlessly, to whom can I advise a prescribed conduct?
How would I attain heaven?"

Shlok 9: "This entire world would follow its own whims, for, whatever the conduct of the
kings may be, such will be the coduct of their subjects."

Shlok 10: "The eternal royal governance is indeed an assemble of truth and not cruel. Hence,
the kingship has the Truth as its essence. The world is established in Truth."

Shlok 11: "Even sages and divine being have respected truthfulness alone. The one who speaks
truth obtains the highest position in this world."

Shlok 12: "People fear of a person, who speaks untruth, as one fears a snake. Truth is the
highest virtue and is stated to be the origin of heaven."

Shlok 13: "Truth is god and all virtues follow truth. All are rooted in truth there is nothing
higher than truth."

Shlok 14: "Gift sacrifice, oblation, austerities performed and the scriptural texts have the
foundation in Truth. Hence, one should thoroughly surrender to truth.

Shlok 15: "One rules over the world. One develops a race. One sinks into hell . One rises high
to heaven (according to one's degree of truthfulness practiced)."

Shlok 16: "I am true to my promise. Why should I not fulfilll the command of my father, who
was a devotee of truth?"

Shlok 17: "Neither covetousness nor forgetfulness nor pride would cause me to destroy the bond
of morality. I shall honour the vow made to my father."

Shlok 18: "Neither gods nor the manes will accept the offerings of those who are wanting in
truth, unsteady and unstable in their minds. This is what is taught to us."

Shlok 19: "I perceive this virtue i the form of truthfulness as a universal permeation of
spirit. That is why, this burden, observed as a vow, has been honoured by good men."

Shlok 20: "I renounce the so-called duty of a warrior, it is injustice under the name of
justice, it is practised by petty cruel and covetous men of evil deeds."

Shlok 21: "Sin is committed by the body after it has been conceived by the mind and falsehood
is spoken with the tongue. Thus, the degrading act is of three types (with body, mind and
tongue)"

Shlok 22: "The earth, fame, prosperity and fortune indeed woo a man of truth. They constantly
oblige the truth: truth should therefore be strictly observed!"

Shlok 23: "The logical words, you have made it out to be good, saying 'Do this good thing' as
uttered to me, are really unworthy."

Shlok 24: "Having promised before my father about my exile to the forest, how can I fulfil
Bharata's words now, abandoning the father's words?"

Shlok 25: "A firm promise has been made by me in the presence of my father, when Queen Kaikeyi
too became rejoiced."

Shlok 26- 27: "I will proceed with life-journey in this manner, by accepting this dwelling in the
forest, by remaining pure in body and mind, having controlled my diet, by feasting the Gods and
Ancestors with pure roots, flowers and fruits, with all my five senses fully sated, without any
deceit, fully devout and discriminative of what ought to be done and what ought not to be
done."

Shlok 28: "Having reached this terrestrial globe (the realm of action), only a virtuous act is
to be undertaken. The god of fire, the wind-god and the moon-god reap the fruits of their
acts."

Shlok 29: "Having performed ahundred sacrifices, Indra the Lord of celestials went to heaven.
Having practised severe austerities, the great sages went to heaven."

Shlok 30: Hearing that argument of atheism inuntiated by Jabali, Rama the prince with a
terrible energy, without tolerating his words, spoke in reproach to him (as follows):

Shlok 31: "The virtuous say that truth, piety, valour, compassion for all beings, polite
speech and worship of Brahmanas, gods and unexpected guests are the paths to heaven."

Shlok 32: "Therefore the learned, well-instructed in what is to be their greatest advantage;
follow their purpose resolutely and fulfill their duty in its entirety properly and attentively,
seeking to attain the highest realms."

Shlok 33: "I accuse the act done by my father in taking you into his service, you with your
misleading intelligence, a firm atheist fallen from the true path."

Shlok 34: "It is an exact state of the case that a mere *intellection deserves to be punished
as it were a thief and know an atheist to be on par with a mere intellectual. Therefore he is the
most suspectable and should be punished in the interest of the poeple. In no case should a wise man
consort with an atheist."

[Commentary] * It is the word that is responding to the chanllenge, which we call
intellection. Truth/God is very subtle. A mind that is caught in the net of words/arguments cannot
understand truth/God.

Shlok 35: "Men that lived before you have performed many auspicious acts, abandoning all hopes
of reward in this world as well as the next. Therefore, Brahmanas offer oblations in the sacred
fire and practise noble deeds."

Shlok 36: "The sages who are devoted to righteousness, associating with men of virtue, endowed
with spiritual splendour, practising abundant charity, harm-less and washed free of all taint, are
honoured into the world."

Shlok 37: "To the high-souled Rama, who never had self-pity and speaking indignantly as
aforesaid, Jabali (that brahmana) replied in a fitting manner in words that were beneficial and
truthful, which showed his belief in authority of Vedas, the other world and so on."

Shlok 38: "I am not speaking the words of non- believers. I am not an atheist, nor is it a
fact that nothing exists whatsoever. Perceiving the time, I have become a believer. When the time
comes, I will become again just a non-believer."

Shlok 39: "O, Rama! That and this time too came gradually. The words of a non-believer were
spoken by me for your sake, to pacify you and to persuade you to return to Ayodhya."



SARGA 110
------------------------------

[Text] Vasishta gives details of the creation of the world to Sri Rama. He says that
Brahma, in the form of a boar caused the earth to rise from water and from Brahma is created the
entire world. He recites the Genealogy of Rama's line. He informs that Aja and Suvrata were the two
sons of Nabhaga and it was Aja who begot the virtuous King Dasaratha; Rama's father. Vasishta also
informs Rama that i the whole of Ikshvaku race, only the eldest son becomes the king. He requests
Sri Rama not to violate this tradition and take over the reins of Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: Recognising that Rama has become angry, Vashishta spoke as follows: "Even Jabali is
aware of the going and coming of this world."

Shlok 2: "He apoke in this manner, on account of his desire that you should return. O, Lord
of the poeple! Learn from me of the creation of the world!"

Shlok 3: "All was water only in the beginning" from which element the earth was formed. After
that, the self-existent Brahma with all the gods came into existence."

Shlok 4: "Thereafter, that Brahma, assuming the form of boar, caused the earth to rise from
water and with his sons of pure soul, created the entire world."

Shlok 5: "The eternal, changeless and imperishable Brahma was begotten from ether and from
his was born Marichi. Marichi's son was kashyapa."

Shlok 6: "From Kashyapa, Vivasvan(sun-god) was born. manu was the son of Vivasvan. Manu for
his part, was formerly the lord of creation. Ikshvaku was Manu' s son."

Shlok 7: "The entire fertile earth was given by Manu to Ikshvaku and know that Ikshvaku was
thus the first king of Ayodhya!"

Shlok 8: "Ikshvaku's son was known as Kukshi, the illustrious king. Then, Kukshi's son was
the valiant Vikukshi."

Shlok 9: "To Vikukshi was born the most splendid and powerful son, Bana. To Bana was born
Anaranya the mighty armed and the most illustrious son."

Shlok 10: "While this King Anaranya, the most excellent among beings was reigning, there was
neither dearth of rain nor a drought. No one was a thief."

Shlok 11: "From Anaranya was born the mighty armed king Prithu. From Prithu was born the
Emperor Trishanku. That valiant man ascneded to heaven along with his mortal body, because of his
true eloquence."

Shlok 12: "To Trishanku was born a son, the highly illustrious Dundhumara. From Dundhumara was
born the hero, Yuvanasva."

Shlok 13- 14: "The illustrious Mandhata was born as a son to Yuvanasva. To Mandhata was born the
hero, Susandhi. There were two sons Dhruvasandhi and prasenajit to Susandhi. From Dhruvasandhi was
born the illustrious Bharata, the annihilator of enemies."

Shlok 15- 16: "From the mighty armed Bharata was born a son named Asita, for whom his royal
adversaries, Haihayas, Talajanghas and the valiant Shashibindavas became the enemies."

Shlok 17: "Having drawn out his battle-array against all those kings in a combat, the king
Asita was driven away. Asita then became a devoted sage taking asylum in an excellent and charming
mountain."

Shlok 18: "Asita's two wives became pregnant. It is a hearsay that one of his wives gave
poison to the other co-wife in order to destroy her foetus."

Shlok 19: "A sage called Chyavana, belonging to Bhrign race was staying in a Himalayan
mountain. Kalindi (Asita's wife) approached that sage and offered her salutation. That brahmna
spoke the following words to her, who wanted to obtain a boon for the birth of a son."

Shlok 20: "O, Queen! A high-souled son, who will be world-famous, rightous, of a good conduct,
a perpetuator of the race and an annihilator of enemies will be born to you."

Shlok 21- 22: "The delighted Queen Kalindi circumambulated that sage, took permission from him to
leave and thereafter on reaching home, had delivered a son, having eyes resembling lotus-leaves and
having a radiance like that of Brahama the Lord of creation."

Shlok 23: "Poison was given earlier by her co-wife with an intention to kill her foetus. Born
with that poison itself, he became Sagara (a man with poison)."

Shlok 24: "It was king SAgara who excavated the ocen and who, by his sacrifice, on the day of
the full moon, by his energy, frightened the people here by the speed of his digging."

Shlok 25: "Asamanja was Sagara's son. There was a hearsay that on account of his wicked deeds,
Asamanja was banished by his father even during his life time."

Shlok 26: "A valiant son called amshuman was born to Asamanja. Dilipa was Amshuman's son.
Bhagiratha was Dilipa's son.

Shlok 27: "Of Bhagiratha was born kakutstha, from whom the Kakutsthas take their name. To
Kakutsthas was born a son called Raghu, from whence spring Raghavas."

Shlok 28: "From Raghu was born a renowned son named Pravriddha, known in the world under the
names Purushadaka, Kalmashapada and Soudasa."

Shlok 29: "Kalmashapada's son was renowned as Shankhana, who, even on attaining his father's
valour, perished (in a battle) along with his army."

Shlok 30- 31- 32- 33: The fortunate Sudarshana was the son of Shankhana. Sudarshana's son was Agnivarna;
and of Agnivarna was born Shighraga. Shighraga begot Maru and Maru's son was Prashushruva from
Prashushruva was born Ambarisha of that great radiance. To Ambarisha was born a son named Nahusha
who was full of valour. Nahusha's son was Nabhaga of outstanding virtue. Aja and Suvrata were the
two sons of Nabhaga and it was Aja who begot the virtuous King Dasartha."

Shlok 34: "You are the eldest son of that Dasaratha, very well-known as Rama, the heir who can
claim over the inheritance. O, King! Hence, take over your kingdom and look after your people
there."

Shlok 35: "The eldest son only becomes the king in the entire Ikshvaku race. When the eldest
son exists, the younger son will not become a king. The eldest son only is anointed to the
crown.

Shlok 36: "O, the celebrated one! This is the eternal tradition of your race, those born in
Raghu dynasty and ought not to be violated by you. Rule over the earth, this vast kingdom abudant
with precious metals, as did your father."



SARGA 111
------------------------------

[Text] Vashishta urges Rama to grant the prayer of Bharata. Rama replies that the command
given by his father cannot be disregarded. Bharata then decides to undertake a fest unto death as a
last resort to exert pressure on Rama. On Rama's dubbing such a step as repugnant to the code of
conduct prescribed for a kshatriya, Bharata requests Rama to allow him to remain in the forest as
the latter's proxy. Rama, however, rules out this proposition also, saying that it is a matter of
reproach. He reaffirms his resolve to enter Ayodhya only after implementing the pledge given to his
father.

Shlok 1: Having spoken thus to Rama, Vasishta the royal priest added the following righteous
words:

Shlok 2: "O, Kakutstha, O offspring the Raghu dynasty! From birth, the three spiritual
instructors of a man are his teacher, his father and his mother."

Shlok 3: "O, excellent among men! The father of man his life. The teacher instructs him in
wisdom and therefore instructs the teacher is said to be the superior!"

Shlok 4: "O, Rama the tormentator of the enemies! I am the spiritual Preceptor to your father
and to you too. In obeying my words, you will not transgress the path of the virtuous."

Shlok 5: "O, dear prince! These subjects, the traders, the other categories of people and
Brahmana are your people only. In fulfilling your duty to them, you will not be transgressing your
righteous path."

Shlok 6: "You ought not to be lacking in reverence to your mother who is aged and possessing
a noble conduct. By carrying out her words, you will not deviate from the path of the
virtuous."

Shlok 7: "O, Rama excelling in truth and virtue. By fulfilling the words of the beseeching
Bharata, you will not be false to yourself."

Shlok 8: Having heard the sweet words spoken by his spiritual preceptro himself, Rama the
excellent among men replied (as follows) to Vasishta who was seated there.

Shlok 9- 10: "The good, which a father and mother do, by giving whatever they can, to their son
constantly, by putting him to sleep, rubbing his body with oil etc, nay, by speaking kindly to him
every moment, and even by nourishing him, can never be wholly requited."

Shlok 11: "The command laid upon me by king Dasaratha, my father, who begot me, cannot
therefore be disregarded."

Shlok 12: Hearing Rama's words, the most generous Bharata felt very mcuh anguished and
addressed the following words to Sumantra the charioteer who was standing nearby:

Shlok 13: "O, charioteer! Spread speedily the Kusha grass on the ground here for me. I shall
remain facing my illustrious brother till he gets propitiated (and grant my request)."

Shlok 14: "I shall remain lying down in front of Rama's hut without food or drink and
depriving myself of light until he returns to Ayodhya, like a brahman who is a destitute (lies down
at the door of his crditor)."

Shlok 15: Seeing Sumantra who was gazing at Rama waiting for his command, the low-spirited
Bharata, on his own, brought a heap of Kusha grass and spread it on the floor.

Shlok 16: Rama of great splendour and the best among royal sages spoke to Bharata as follows:
"O Bharata my dear brother! What wrong have I done that you lie down before me?"

Shlok 17: "A brahmana may lie down on one side in order to obstruct a willful debtor in this
world. But, it is not befitting for a warrior-class.

Shlok 18: "O Bharata, Tiger among men! Giving up this formidable resolve, rise up proceed
speedily to Ayodhya the best of cities, from here."

Shlok 19: Still sitting in the same posture, Bharata looked at the citizens and rural folk
around on all sides and asked them why they were not entreating his venerable brother to
return.

Shlok 20: Those people, the inhabitants of town and country replied to the magnanimous Bharata
as follows: "We know Rama very well. He is speaking rightly."

Shlok 21: "This Rama of exalted merit is indeed standing on his father's words. Hence, we are
not able to convince him to return to Ayodhya."

Shlok 22: Hearing their words, Rama said to Bharata: "Reflect on the words of your companions,
who see rightly."

Shlok 23: "O the mighty armed Bharata! Having listened to their testimony and mine, reflect on
the matter carefull. Rise and touch me and drink water."

Shlok 24: Thereafter, Bharata rose, touched water and spoke as follows: "Let the audience,
including ministers and the guild of traders hear me also."

Shlok 25: "I never asked my father for the kingdom, nor did I counsel my mother to enthrone
me. I never gave my approval for the exile of Rama, the venerable hero, who knows his duty very
well."

Shlok 26: "If it is absolutely essential that one of us should remain here and the command of
our father be executed, then it is I who will reside in the forest for fourteen years."

Shlok 27: The high-souled Rama was surprised by the sincere words of his brother and by
looking at the inhabitants of town and country, spoke (as follows):

Shlok 28: "The disposal, the pledge and the come-by which he was alive, cannot be broken
either by me or by Bharata."

Shlok 29: "I cannot accede to the substitute in respect of the sojourn in the forest and it is
distasteful thing. What was advised by Kaikeyi was proper and what was done by my father was a
righteous deed."

Shlok 30: "I am aware that Bharata has necessary patience and due devotion for the elders. All
will be propitious in the case of this magnanimous Bharata, who is true to his promise."

Shlok 31: "After returning from the forest, I shall rule the earth, assisted by my virtuous
brother."

Shlok 32: "The king Dasaratha was indeed solicited for a boon by Kaikeyi. That word of the
king has been fulfilled by me. Hence, relieve our father, the emperor from the blame."



SARGA 112
------------------------------

[Text] On hearing the debate between Rama and Bharata, all the sages there were astonished.
The sages request Bharata to accept Rama's words. Bharata explains to Rama that he is unable to
rule the vast kingdom alone to the satisfaction of its subjects. Bharata further adds that Rama has
the necessary competence to save the world and makes a fervent appeal to Rama to return to Ayodhya.
However, Rama replies that Bharata is quite capable of ruling the kingdom and advises Bharata to
take counsel from his wise ministers before administering the kingdom. Rama reaffirms Bharata that
he will never be fulse to his father's vow. Finally, Bharata agrees to Rama;s proposition, but
requests Rama to offer his sandals to be carried by him to ayodhya so that the peope there would
get gain and security. Rama agrees to it and offers his sandals to Bharata, who takes a vow before
Rama to enter fire in case he did not return immediately after the expiry of his term of exile.
After embracing Bharata and Shatrughna, Rama bids farewell to all with due respect in accord with
the rank of each and enters his hermitage.

Shlok 1: Witnessing that thrilling converse between those two brothers with incomparable
dignity, the great sages gathered there were astonished.

Shlok 2: The assemblies of ascetics, great saints present there and the distinguished sages
who stood invisible in space, applauded both Rama and Bharata, the magnanimous brothers, saying (as
follows):

Shlok 3: "That Dasaratha, who begot these two sons, who know righteousness and whose strength
is justice, was fortunate. By hearing the debate between these two princes, we are indeed
delighted."

Shlok 4: Thereafter, that assembly of sages, who wished to see a quick destruction of Ravana,
came together and spoke the following words to Bharata, the excellent king.

Shlok 5: "O Bharata born in a noble race, highly intelligent, having a superior conduct and a
great repute! If you have regard for your father, Rama's words are to be accepted.

Shlok 6: "We wish to see Rama absolved of all obligations forever to his father. Dasaratha,
having honoured his pledge to Kaikeyi, indeed went to heaven."

Shlok 7: Having uttered that much, all the celestial musicians and the great sages then went
to their respective abodes.

Shlok 8: Hearing those auspicious words, the good-looking Rama looked radiant and worshipped
those sages with a joyful countenance.

Shlok 9: Bharata, on his part, with trembled limbs, joined his palms in salutation and again
spoke the following words to Rama in a strangled voice:

Shlok 10: "O, Rama! Keep in view the continuance of our royal statue and the statute of the
race. You ought to yield to the entreaties of mine and those of your mother."

Shlok 11: "I am not able to rule this vast empire alone to the satisfaction of the beloved
inhabitants of town and country!"

Shlok 12: "Our kith and king, soldiers, companions and allies are waiting for you indeed, as
farmers wait for the rainy clouds."

Shlok 13: "O, the sagacious Rama! Return to the kingdom and keep it in order. You have the
competence to save the world!"

Shlok 14: That Bharata, who was kind-spoken, thus made a fervent appeal to Rama and fell at
his feet.

Shlok 15: Placing on his lap, that Bharata of dark hue, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and
having a voice like that of a swan in rut, Rama spoke the following words to him:

Shlok 16: "O, my dear brother! You are very much competent to rule the earth, by the intellect
you obtained both inherently and by training."

Shlok 17: "Take counsel with your ministers, companions and intelligent counsellors and get
all activities done, even if they are gigantic."

Shlok 18: "Light may go off from the moon; Himalayan mountain may shake off its snows; the sea
may transgress its shores, but I will never be false to my father's vow!"

Shlok 19: "My dear brother! Your mother acted thus, for your sake, out of her affection or
ambition. It should not be carried out in your mind. You ought to obey her as your mother."

Shlok 20: Bharata replied (as follows) to Rama, who was speaking as aforesaid and who was
equal to sun by his splendour or to the moon in its first quarter.

Shlok 21: "O, noble brother! Pray mount with your feet on the wooden sandals adorned with
gold! Surely, these will bestow, gain and security to all the people!"

Shlok 22: Rama, the tiger among men, possessing exceptional glory, placing his feet on the
sandals and leaving them, gave them to the magnanimous Bharata.

Shlok 23- 24: Bowing before the sandals, Bharata spoke the following words to Rama: "O, Rama the
hero and the tormentator of enemies! For fourteen years, I shall wear matted locks and robes of
bark, live on fruits and roots O Rama, and live outside the city, offering the ruling of the
kingdom to your sandals."

Shlok 25: "O, Rama! If I do not see you the following day when the fourteenth year has fully
ended, I shall enter the fire once for all."

Shlok 26: "So be it" promised Rama, embraced that Bharata with affection, took Shatrughna also
in his arms and spoke to Bharata as follows:

Shlok 27- 28: "O Bharata! Protect your mother, Kaikeyi. Do not get angry with her. You are taken
vow thus by me and by Seetha." speaking thus, Rama with his eyes filled iwth tears, bade farewell
to his brother.

Shlok 29: The valiant Bharata, who knew righteousness worshipped those sandals which were
well-decorated made a circumambulation to Rama and kept the sandals on the head of an excellent
elephant.

Shlok 30: Rama, the augmentator of Raghu dynasty, being firm as a Himalayan rock in abiding in
his own righteousness, greeted those men, in accord with their rank, the host of his preceptors,
ministers, subjects and his brothers and bade farewell to all of them.

Shlok 31: His mothers, their voices choked with tears due to sorrow, were unable to bid
farewell verbally to Rama. However, Rama himself offered his salutations to all his mothers and
entered his hermitage, weeping.



SARGA 113

[Text] Keeping Rama's sandals on his head, Bharata ascends his chariot along with
Shatrughna. Bharata advances along with his troops along side the mountain of chitrakuta. On the
way, he beholds Bharadvaja's hermitage and meets the sage. Bharata informs the sage about the
insistance of Rama to stay back in the forest for fourteen years so as to honour the promise of his
father scruprulously and also Vaishta's advice to Rama to offer his sandals to Bharata, to ensure
peace and harmony in Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, keeping the sandals on his head, Bharata delightfully ascended his
chariot along with Shatrughna.

Shlok 2: Before him, Vasishta, Vasudeva of firm vows, Jabali and all the ministers
distinguished for their counsels, went ahead.

Shlok 3: Them, they advanced eastwards, by the charming Mandakini River, after making a round
of Chitrakuta Mountain.

Shlok 4: Observing various types of thousands of enchanting rocks, Bharata advanced along
with his troops along the side of the mountain.

Shlok 5: In the vicinity of Chitrakuta Mountain, Bharata saw a hermitage where the sage
Bharadwaja resided.

Shlok 6: Then, that Bharata endowed with understanding reached that hermitage of Bharadwaja,
descended from his chariot and bowed down to the feet of Bharadwaja in saluation.

Shlok 7: The, Bharadvaja full of joy, enquired of Bharata saying, "O, dear prince! Has your
purpose been accomplished? Have you met Rama?"

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of the learned sage, Bharadvaja, Bharata who was affectionate
towards his brothers, replied to Bharadvaja (as follows)

Shlok 9: Despite the entreaties of his preceptor and of mine, Rama is unshakeable in his
resolve and most cheerfully spoke the following words to Vasishta.

Shlok 10: "I shall honour the promise of my father scrupulously and reside in the forest for
fourteen years as I promised him."

Shlok 11: Hearing the words of Rama, the highly wise Vasishta, the knower of proper mode of
expression, replied to Rama who is the most skilful of orators, in the following great words:

Shlok 12: "O, the extremely segacious prince! Bestow joyfully thse gold-encrusted sandals of
yours on us and ensure peace and harmony in Ayodhya."

Shlok 13: "Hearing the words of Vasishta, Rama stood up and turning to the East, placed his
feet in those sandals and gave them to me as a sign of regency."

Shlok 14: "Having taken leave of the very high-souled Rama, I turned back after receiving the
auspicious sandals. Now, I am proceeding to Ayodhya."

Shlok 15: Hearing those auspicious words of the high-souled Bharata, the sage Bharadvaja spoke
to him the following words.

Shlok 16: "O Bharata the Tiger among men and excellent among those having virtue and good
conduct! There is no surprise that a noble trait prevails in you, as naturally as the water allowed
to go, always settles downwards."

Shlok 17: "Your valiant father, Dasaratha, is immortal in having such a son as you are, the
knower of righteousness and loving peity."

Shlok 18: Hearing the words of that sage, Bharata with his joined palms, touched his feet in
salutation and began taking leave from him.

Shlok 19: Then, the glorious Bharata made circumambulation again and again to Bharadwaja and
proceeded to Ayodhya along with hims ministers.

Shlok 20: Thata extensive army of Bharata, following him with vehicles, carts and elephants,
turned back again towards Ayodhya.

Shlok 21: Thereafter, all of them crossed the charming River Yamuna wreathed with waves and
moreover saw the River Ganga with its pure water.

Shlok 22: Bharata accompanied by his relative and his army crossed that River Ganga, full of
charming waters and entered the beautiful town of Shringibhera. From Shringibhera, he saw Ayodhya
again.

Shlok 23: Beholding the City of Ayodhya, which was bereft of his father and brother, Bharata
tormented with grief, spoke the following words to the charioteer:

Shlok 24: "O, Charioteer! See that Ayodhya city, ruined, with a vacant look, joyless,
miserable, and with an impeded voice."



SARGA 114
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata enters Ayodhya city, which appears to him gloomy and asks his charioteer why
the city is looking luster-less. Thus speaking in many ways, Bharata enters his father's house
which exhibits a vacant look and feels distressed.

Shlok 1: The highly illustrious Lord, Bharata riding on a chariot emanating a gentle and deep
sound entered soon the city of Ayodhya.

Shlok 2: He entered the city, frequented by cats and owls, abiding with crouched men and
elephants and looking like a night enveloped by gloom, indistinctness and darkness.

Shlok 3: Ayodhya looked like the planet Rohini, the beloved consort of the moon-god (treated
as the enemy by the demon Rahu), tormented by planet Rahu* in the ascendant though ordinarily
invested with an exceedingly bright splendour by virtue of her glory.

[Commentary] *The demon presiding over a planet of the same name figuring in Indian astronomy
and identified by modern astronoy with the shadow of the earth cast on the orb of the moon during
what is known as a lunar eclipse.

Shlok 4: Ayodhya further looked emaciated like a mountain stream, whose scanty waters had
become hot and agitated, birds living in which were scorched by the sun, and whose fish, small and
big and alligators had perished.

Shlok 5: Ayodhya looked like a flame of sacrificial fire which when oblation is poured into
it, rises like a golden cone without smoke and thereafter sinks into extinction (ash).

Shlok 6: Ayodhya looked like an afflicted army, shattered of its armour in a major conflict,
whose ensigns borne on horses, elephants and chariots had been torn, and its heroic warriors
slain.

Shlok 7: Ayodhya appeared like the waves of the sea though tosses very high with foam and a
roar, is rendered noiseless, being shaken up by a silent wind.

Shlok 8: Ayodhya appeared like a sacred altar, which, when the period of offering oblations
into fire has completely expired, has been cleared of all sacrificial implements and deserted of
recitations by the learned priests.

Shlok 9: Ayodhya appeared like restless kine, deprived of the bull, who cease to graze in new
pastures and stand in the cow-pen, dispirited.

Shlok 10: Ayodhya was resembling a new pearl-necklace, bereft of well- polished dazzling and
excellent gems, rubies and the like, of genuine quality.

Shlok 11: Ayodhya appeared like a meteor, which moved from its position with its virtue
exhausted, soon dropped from the sky and fallen to earth, deprived of its splendour.

Shlok 12: Ayodhya appeared like a flowering creeper laden with blossom in the spring-tide,
frequented by a swarm of intoxicated bees, that is suddenly consumed by a forest fire and
withering.

Shlok 13: With its senseless traffic paralyzed and with its fairs and markets closed, Ayodhya
resembled like a firmament, covered with clouds, with the moon and stars obscured.

Shlok 14: Ayodhya appeared splendourless, like a deserted and uncleaned tavern, with its
vendor of spirituous liquors killed, the excellent wine expended, its drinking pots and glasses
broken and the pieces stewn in disorder.

Shlok 15: Ayodhya resembled a cistern erected for storage and distribution of water, but now
broken and collapsed with its platform riven and sunk, and covered with broken jars and earthen
vessels, its water having been used up.

Shlok 16: Ayodhya resembled a bow-string, which was large and bent, with suitable noose at
both ends, but severed from the bow by the arrows of heroes and fallen to the ground.

Shlok 17: Ayodhya appeared like a mare, urged on suddenly by a horse-man, skilled in war-fare
and fallen down when killed by the opposite army.

Shlok 18: Sitting in the chariot, the glorious Bharata, the son of Dasaratha, spoke the
following words to the charioteer who was riding his excellent chariot:

Shlok 19: "How is it that the deep and intensified sound of vocal and instrumental music is
not heard as before in Ayodhya today?"

Shlok 20: "The intoxicating odour of spirituous liquor or the fragrance of floral garlands or
the aroma of sandal and aloe-wood fumes, which used to be spread once on all sides, are not being
wafted."

Shlok 21- 22: "O, Sumantra! I do not hear, as before, the sound of the horses, the sound of the
intoxicating elephants and the clattering of the great chariots in this city now."

Shlok 23: "Rama, having left Ayodhya, the distressful youth are not making use of the perfumes
like sandal-wood, aloe wood as also the most admirable and fresh floral garlands."

Shlok 24: "In the city afflicted by Rama's desertion, people are not going out for
pleasure-trips, wearing colourful garlands nor festivals are observed by them."

Shlok 25: "The lustre of Ayodhya has departed along with my brother. It is certain. This
Ayodhya is not shining indeed, like a rainy night at the time of the waning moon."

Shlok 26: "When will my brother return, like a carnival, diffusing joy in Ayodhya, as do the
autumnal rains?"

Shlok 27: "The highways in Ayodhya are not glittering with youthful people, richly attired,
bearing themselves bravely and roaming about in groups."

Shlok 28: Thus speaking in many ways, Bharata entered his father's house, bereft of that
emperor and which resembled a cave bereft of a lion.

Shlok 29: Bharata, though a composed man himself, shed tears by seeing that entire empty
gynaecium, looking like a day without the sun with its relinquished radiance.



SARGA 115
------------------------------

[Text] After returning to Ayodhya, Bharata expresses his desire to proceed to Nandigrama
village. Vasishta and the other elders agree to his proposal. Bharata along with Shatrughna ascend
the chariot and proceed towards Nandigram. The ministers, family-priest, the army and the citizens
of Ayodhya followed Bharata in his journey. Installing the wooden sandals of Rama on the royal
throne, Bharata puts on the garb of an ascetic and carries on the rule under orders of the sandals,
holding the royal canopy over them.

Shlok 1: Having brought his mothers back to Ayodhya; Bharata, fixed in his resolve but sore
stricken with grief, spoke to Vasishta and the elders (as follows)

Shlok 2: "I am going to Nandigrama village. I take leave of all of you. There, I shall be
able to endure all this woe, occasioned by Rama's absence."

Shlok 3: "The king Dasaratha went to heaven. My elder brother is in the forest. I shall await
for Rama to return to the kingdom; since verily he alone is the celebrated Lord of Ayodhya."

Shlok 4: Hearing those auspicious words of the magnanimous Bharata, Vasishta the preceptor
and all the ministers spoke as follows:

Shlok 5: "O, Bharata! The words which your have spoken by you in devotion to your brother are
very much appreciable. It is worthy of you alone."

Shlok 6: "What man would not approve of the proposal of your highness, who are deeply
fascinated of your relative, always affectionate to your brother and devoted to the path of
elders?"

Shlok 7: Hearing the affectionate words of his counsellors, who spoke according to his wish,
Bharata said to his charioteer, "Let my chariot be made ready!"

Shlok 8: The illustrious Bharata, looking pleased and having offered salutation to all his
mothers, entered his chariot along with Shatrughna.

Shlok 9: Both Shatrughna and Bharata, having quickly mounted the chariot and exceedingly
rejoiced, set out, accompanied by ministers and family-priests.

Shlok 10: All the preceptors there, headed by Vasishta and other brahmanas being in the
forefront, proceeded eastward, in which direction Nandigrama village was situated.

Shlok 11: When Bharata had left, the army too, abounding in elephants, horses and chariots
marched unbidden. The residents of the city also followed suit.

Shlok 12: The magnanimous Bharata, affectionate of his brother, bearing the sandals belong to
Rama on his head, set out for Nandigrama.

Shlok 13: Thereafter, having entered Nandigrama briskly Bharata descended his chariot quickly
and spoke to his preceptors as follows:

Shlok 14: "My brother, Rama has given to me this kingdom as a trust. These sandals,
embellished with gold diffuse gain and security to the people."

Shlok 15: Having dedicated the sacred trust to the wooden sandals, Bharata sore-stricken with
anguish, spoke to the entire body of his ministers as follows:

Shlok 16: "Hold the state canopy speedily over these wooden sandals, which have been accepted
as symbols of the feet of Rama, my noble brother. By the presence of these wooden sandals of my
brother here, a piety has been established in the kingdom."

Shlok 17: "As a mark of compassion, this trust has been placed at my disposal, by my brother.
There trust as such will be preserved till his return."

Shlok 18: "Having restored these wooden sandals personally to Rama's feet immediately after
his return, I shall behold those feet of Rama along with these sandals."

Shlok 19: "Restoring the kingdom to my elder brother, when re-united with him and thereby
laying down the burden, I shall then assume the role of a servant of my elder brother."

Shlok 20: "By giving away these excellent wooden sandals, the symbols of trust, this kingdom,
as well as the City of Ayodhya to Rama, I shall be washed of all my sins."

Shlok 21: "Rama will be installed and his subjects made happy. It will be a four-fold more
fame and happiness for me than that having obtained from the kingdom."

Shlok 22: The highly illustrious Bharata though a distressed man, thus lamenting and pained,
looked after the state administration along with his ministers from Nandigrama.

Shlok 23: Assuming bark robes and matted locks in the guise of an ascetic, the lord and the
hero Bharata dwelt in Nandigrama, protected by the army.

Shlok 24: Bharata, obedient to his elder brother, affectionate of his brothers and faithful to
his vow, thus resided in Nandigrama, coronating the wooden sandals on the throne and wishing always
for the return of Rama.

Shlok 25: Reporting all the royal orders to the wooden sandals, Bharata was holding the royal
canopy together with the chowrie to those sandals.

Shlok 26: Coronating the wooden sandals of his elder brother, the illustrious Bharata
thereafter carried out the state administration, always maintaining his subservience to them.

Shlok 27: Whatever a small affair of the state came up or whenever a high-valued gift was
offered, Bharata used to report that matter to the wooden sandals and then only dealt with it in
the proper way afterwards.



SARGA 116
------------------------------

[Text] Rama notices anxiety and perturbation among the sages who live in the vicinity. When
an elderly sage among them is asked by Rama about the reason for their anguish, the said sage
informs that some demons under the leadership of Khara are molesting the sages and hence the sages
wished to leave the place. Rama gives his consent for their leaving. Bidding farewell to them with
great respect, Rama retires to his own hermitage.

Shlok 1: Bharata having returned (to Ayodhya), Rama who was dwelling in the woods, observed
anxiety accompanied by perturbation among the sages.

Shlok 2: He saw there those ascetics-who were formerly quite pleased in that hermitage at
Chitrakuta depending as they did on Rama- anxious.

Shlok 3: Pointing out to Rama through the movements of their eyes and eye-brows manifesting
their anxiety, they whispered among themselves, narrating some legends in secret.

Shlok 4: Perceiving their distress, Rama was filled with apprehension about himself and with
joined palms spoke the following words to a sage, the leader of that community of ascetics:

Shlok 5: "O venerable sage! I fear that the conduct of my forefathers is not seen in me or
there is some change for the worse in me, due to which the ascetics feel agitated."

Shlok 6: "Has my younger brother, the high-souled Lakshmana, through inadvertence, behaved
unworthy of him while the sages were seeing?"

Shlok 7: "I hope that Seetha, who is serving you and who is keen in serving me, does not, I
am afraid, behaved properly, according to the conduct suitable for women."

Shlok 8: Then, that grown-up sage, who was elderly both by age and penance, appeared
trembling and spoke to Rama, who was ever compassionate to all beings, as follows:

Shlok 9: "O, dear Rama! What is there for us the ascetics to fear above all from Seetha, who
is natural in her disposition and is the follower of virtue?"

Shlok 10: "It is on account of demons, who, through enmity to you, have begun to oppress the
sages. Alarmed by it, they discuss with each other how they can best defend themselves."

Shlok 11- 12: "O, darling! Here, a demon called Khara, Ravana's younger brother- who is a boaster,
victorious in battle, cruel and eater of human flesh, haughty and sinful-having uprooted all the
ascetics who dwell in Janasthana, is unable to endure you also."

Shlok 13: "My darling! From which time you came to dwell in this hermitage, from that time
inwards, the demons continue to ill-treat the ascetics."

Shlok 14: "They appear in grotesque and harmful forms, filling them with terror, in diverse
forms and possessing ugly and unnatural demeanor."

Shlok 15: "Flinging filthy and inauspicious objects on some of the ascetics, the wicked demons
stand in front of them and kill some ascetics too."

Shlok 16: "Having themselves in those hermitages unnoticed, those evil-minded demons delight
themselves in destroying the ascetics there."

Shlok 17: "At the time of pouring oblations into the sacred fire, they scatter the sacrificial
vessels, sprinkle the fires with water and break the water-pots."

Shlok 18: "Resolved to leave these retreats that have been invaded by evil spirits, the
ascetics today are urging me to go to another area."

Shlok 19: "O, Rama! Before those wicked beings indeed show bodily injury to the ascetics, we
are abandoning this hermitage."

Shlok 20: "Not far from here, there is a colourful grove yielding many roots and fruits. I
will take shelter again in that previous hermitage itself, along with an assembly of sages."

Shlok 21: "O, darling! Khara, the demon will behave unjustly with you in the same way. If your
mind feels so inclined, come along with us from here."

Shlok 22: "O, Rama! To you, who live with your wife, though you are competent and ever
watchful, there is a danger. Your stay here is conduced with misery now."

Shlok 23: Rama the prince could not with his responsive words desist the said sage when he had
spoken as aforesaid, eager as he was to leave the place.

Shlok 24: Having greeted, bidding farewell and justifying his statement to Rama, that leader
of the community departed, leaving the hermitage, along with a host of sages.

Shlok 25: Accompanying them for a distance from that place, bidding farewell to that group of
sages, offering his salutation to that ascetic, the leader of the community and taking leave of
them, who were well-pleased and having received their counsel, Rama returned to his dwelling, which
was sacred to reside.

Shlok 26: That Rama, the lord, did not leave even for a moment that hermitage that had been
deserted by the sages. But some ascetics among them who had fixed their mind on Rama (who followed
the conduct of the sages) constantly followed Rama.



SARGA 117
------------------------------

[Text] Rama, after due reflection, decides to leave Chitrakuta mountain because of many
handicaps. Setting out his journey from Chitrakuta mountain, he reaches the hermitage of Sage Atri
and offers his salutation to him. Introducing his wife Anansuya as a great female ascetic to Rama,
Atri urges Rama to send his concert Seetha to Anasuya. Anasuya receives Seetha, who greeted her and
gives her instructions on the role and responsibilities of a devoted wife.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, when the sages departed, Rama, reflecting again and again, found no
pleasure to remain in that place for many reasons.

Shlok 2: "It is here that Bharata, my mother along with the inhabitants of the city visited
me. That memory haunts me, who lament for them daily."

Shlok 3: "The dry dung of horses and elephants of that high souled Bharata's encamped army
caused much spoliation (around here)."

Shlok 4: "We shall, therefore, move elsewhere", pondering thus, Rama along with Seetha and
Lakshmana left that place.

Shlok 5: On the way, after reaching the hermitage of a sage called Atri, the highly
celebrated Rama offered salutation to that sage. The venerable sage, Atri too received him as his
own son.

Shlok 6: Offering personally, abundant hospitality with full honours to Rama, the sage Atri
rendered equal honour to Lakshmana and the highly blessed Seetha too.

Shlok 7: Atri, who knew righteousness and who was interested in the welfare of all beings,
called his aged wife Anasuya who had just come there, she who was revered by all and addressed
gently to her.

Shlok 8: Atri excellent sage spoke to the illustrious Anasuya, rich in asceticism and who
lived a pious life, saying "You welcome Videha's daughter!" and thereafter introduced that virtuous
female ascetic to Rama (as follows):

Shlok 9- 10- 11- 12: "O, Irreproachable Rama! When the earth was burnt up by drought without break for
ten years, this virtuous woman produced fruit and roots, caused the River Jahnavi to flow here,
undergoing a rigid mortification enriched by pious observances, by whom the most severe asceticism
was practised for ten thousand years and obstacles were done away with and by whom for the reason
of a divine command, in a great hurry ten nights were reduced to one night.* This Anasuya, who has
bathed after completion of the voes, is like a mother to you."

[Commentary] *We read in Puranas how sage Mandavya once pronounced a curse against a
hermitess, Sandili by name, who was a friend of Anasuya that she would be widowed one morning
within the next ten days. The hermitess in her turn pronounced a counter-curse saying that there
would be no dawn any more. Alarmed at this, gods approached Anasuya, who by virtue of her
asceticism converted the period of ten nights into one and in this way averted the death of the
hermittess, husband and accomplished the purpose of gods.

Shlok 13: "Let Seetha find refuge with that ascetic, who is revered by all the beings, famous
as she is and though old is ever free from anger."

Shlok 14: Saying "Be it so" to the aforesaid sage, who was speaking thus, Rama spoke to the
virtuous Seetha, the following excellent words:

Shlok 15: "O, princess! You have heard what the sage has said. For your own good, approach the
saintly Anasuya without delay."

Shlok 16: Hearing these words of Rama, who is desirous of her welfare, Seetha the daughter of
Mithila circumambulated around Anasuya, Atri's wife, who knows piety.

Shlok 17- 18: Seetha coolly and reverently paid homage to that fortunate Anasuya, a devoted and
virtuous wife, who was feeble, wrinkled, aged, with her hair turned grey due to old age, and whose
frame constantly shook like a banana tree in a storm. Seetha introduced herself, by announcing her
name to Anasuya.

Shlok 19: Saluting the irreproachable ascetic the rejoiced Seetha with joined palms enquired
about he well-being.

Shlok 20: Then, comforting that celebrated Seetha, engaged in righteous acts, Anasuya
rejoicingly spoke as follows: "Luckily enough, you are attending to righteousness."

Shlok 21: "O, Seetha the beautiful lady! Thank heaven! Leaving your relatives, honour and
prosperity, you are accompanying Rama, who is expelled into a forest."

Shlok 22: "Highly fortunate worlds await those women, await those women, to whom their husband
is dear no matter whether he lives in a city or in a forest; whether he is sinful or virtuous."

Shlok 23: "To women of noble nature, the husband is the highest deity no mater whether he is
ill-behaved or licentious or devoid of riches."

Shlok 24: "O, Seetha! On a reflection, I perceive none who is a better friend than a husband,
who protects his wife in all circumstances, like the imperishable fruit of one's austerities."

Shlok 25: "Those evil women, whose hearts follow their passions and conduct themselves
dominating their husband, having no understanding of virtue and vice, do not follow him in the
aforesaid manner."

Shlok 26: "O, Seetha! Surely, those evil women, who get into an improper act of authority over
their husbands reap infamy and decline in righteousness."

Shlok 27: "Women, like you, on the other hand who are endowed with virtues, who look with
detachment on prosperity and adversity in this world, therefore dwell in heaven as those who
performed meritorious deeds."

Shlok 28: "Thus devoted to your lord, loyal to your husband, following established rules, you
become an honest wife to your husband and obtain merit and renown."



SARGA 118
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha agrees to the instructions given by Anasuya on the duties of a devoted wife.
At the end of the conversation with Seetha, Anasuya requests her to ask for a boon, and highly
pleased with her, Anasuya bestows heavenly flowers and ornaments on her. Anasuya then requests
Seetha to relate to her the story of her marriage with Rama. Then Seetha relates that story to
Anasuya in detail.

Shlok 1: Anasuya having spoken thus, Seetha without any jealousy, full of reverence for her,
addressed her gently as follows:

Shlok 2: "It is not a surprise that a venerable woman like a you, talk to me like this, for,
I know well that a husband is a respectable person for a woman."

Shlok 3: "O, venerable woman! Even if my husband be without fortune, he should unhesitatingly
be obeyed by me."

Shlok 4: "How much more, if he be renowned for his virtues, compassionate, master of my
heart, who is ever affectionate, a religious person, manifests the tenderness of a mother and a
father to me."

Shlok 5: The exceedingly strong Rama bears himself to all other Queens, as he exercises his
behaviour towards his mother, Kausalya."

Shlok 6: "The valiant and pious Rama who is devoted to Dasartha and free from all sense of
importance treats all those women as his mothers on whom Dasaratha has even once bestowed a single
glance."

Shlok 7: "While departing for the lonely and fearful forest, my mother-in-law imparted a
great message to me, which I have inscribed in my heart."

Shlok 8: "What my mother taught me when witnessed by the fire, earlier at the time of my
marriage with Rama, I shall always remember them."

Shlok 9: "O, virtuous woman! By your words, all that is being renewed. No austerity, other
than obedience to one's husband is decreed for a woman."

Shlok 10: Savitri* is now highly honoured in heaven, for having served her lord faithfully
heaven, You too, having followed this, will proceed to heaven, in showing obedience to your
husband."

[Commentary] SAvitri was the celebrated wife of Prince Satyavan.

Shlok 11: "This goddess Rohini, the excellent among all women, is not seen without the moon
even for a single moment in the sky."

Shlok 12: "Such excellent women, devoted to their husbands, and by their meritorious deeds,
are highly honoured in heaven."

Shlok 13: Hearing the words of Seetha, Anasuya was very much pleased, kissed on Seetha's
forehead and spoke delightfully (as follows)

Shlok 14: "O, Seetha with a bright smile! There is a great merit acquired by me in virtue of
my various pious observances. Through that power, I wish to confer a boon on you."

Shlok 15: "O, Seetha! Your words are suitable for the occasion and are charming too. I am
satisfied. Tell me what good I may do for you."

Shlok 16: Hearing those words of Anasuya, Seetha was surprised and with a gentle smile spoke
to her, who was richly endowed with the power of askesis, saying; "Everything stands fulfilled (by
your grace).

Shlok 17: Thus spoken by Seetha, the pious-minded Anasuya became more delighted and said: "O,
Seetha! Alas! I will create a great joy for you, which will be to your advantage."

Shlok 18- 19: "O, Seetha, the daughter of Videha kingdom! Here are divine gifts: a garland, an
apparel, jewels, a scented cosmetic and rare body-cream. These are all given by me to adorn your
limbs. They will be ever worthy of your and will remain in tact (even after constant use)."

Shlok 20: "O, Seetha! Your body, anointed with these heavenly cosmetics, will cause your
husband to look beautiful, as Lakshmi (the goddess of fortune and beauty) does the imperishable
Vishnu (the Lord of Preservation)."

Shlok 21: Seetha accepted the apparel, the scented cosmetic, the jewels and the garlands as
unsurpassed gifts of love.

Shlok 22: Having accepted those gifts of love, the illustrious Seetha with joined palms, sat
near that female ascetic.

Shlok 23: To inquire about a lovely tale of once upon a time, Anasuya who was firm in
austerity, started asking the following words to Seetha who was sitting near her in that
manner.

Shlok 24: "O, Seetha! It is so said that you were won by the illustrious Rama through a
process of your self-choosing (svayamvara)*. This report has reached my ear."

[Commentary] *Svayamvara= the ceremony of self-choice, when a princess chooses her own
consort from the royal suitors assembled, by placing a garland around his neck.

Shlok 25: "O, Seetha! I wish to hear that narrative in detail. Hence, tell me that tale in
full as you experienced it."

Shlok 26: Then, Seetha obediently answered, saying "Hear me" and began to truly narrate that
tale of Svayamvara to the virtuous woman, Anasuya."

Shlok 27: "A king of Mithila kingdom, named Janaka who was valiant and a knower of
righteousness, was devoted to the duty of his warrior class and was ruling the earth in a fitting
manner."

Shlok 28: "While he was furrowing a territory of land, holding a plough in his hand, it is so
said that I came forth, splitting up the land, as a daughter of that king."

Shlok 29: "The king Janaka, who was absorbed in scattering handfuls of seeds was surprised to
see me, with all my limbs covered with dust."

Shlok 30: "Placing me personally in his lap with affection, that childless king Janaka called
one as his daughter, and was very fond of me since then."

Shlok 31: "It is said that voice resembling that of a human being in the air above me rang
out, saying": "O, King! Let it be so. This divine child without a match is a daughter to you,
rightly."

Shlok 32: "Thereafter, my father the pious mind the lord of men and the king of Mithila
kingdom was rejoiced in my possession and acquired extensive property."

Shlok 33: "That king performing auspicious acts gave me into the care of the chief Queen. She
nourished me fondly and with maternal affection."

Shlok 34: "Seeing my age to be such, when union with a husband can be easily had, my father
fell a prey to anxiety like an indigent man, feeling miserable by the loss of all his
possessions."

Shlok 35: "Eventhough the father of an unmarried girl be like Indra himself on earth, suffers
indignity in the world from the suitor's men, no matter whether they are equal or inferior to
him."

Shlok 36: "Perceiving that ill-treatment threatening him at no distant date, the king Janaka
was plunged into an ocean of anxiety and did not reach its end any more than a man without a bark
would reach the end of a sea."

Shlok 37: "Knowing me to be the one not emerged from a mother's womb, the king after a deep
reflection, was unable to find a suitable and worthy husband for me."

Shlok 38: "After reflecting thus deeply, the thought came to him, 'I shall inaugurate a
Svayamvara, a process of self-choosing marriage, for my daughter."

Shlok 39: "In ancient days, Janaka received with affection from Varuna the rain-god, an
excellent bow with two quivers that should never lack arrows."

Shlok 40: "That bow was so heavy in weight that no man could lift it up nor any of the kings
were bale to bend it even in their dreams."

Shlok 41: "My truthful father called all the princes first and informed them in a meeting
about the bow to be lifted."

Shlok 42: "Whoever is able to lift up and string this bow, I will bestow my daughter in
marriage on him. There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 43: "Seeing that excellent bow, resembling a mountain in weight, and being unable to
lift it up, the princes offered salutation to it and went away."

Shlok 44: "After a very long time, this Rama born in Raghu dynasty with a great splendour
possessing a true valour, along with his brother Lakshmana together with a sage Visvamitra, came to
witness a sacrifice."

Shlok 45: "The pious-souled Visvamitra, having been received well by my father said to my
father, (as follows):

Shlok 46: "These two boys, the sons of Dasaratha wish to see that bow. Show that bow, coming
from gods, to Rama the prince."

Shlok 47- 48: "Hearing the words of Vivamitra, Janaka caused the bow to be brought there. The
mighty and the valiant Rama bent that bow merely within an instant and immediately stringed the bow
with the bow-cord and drew the bow to the full."

Shlok 49: "While Rama was drawing the bow to the full, the bow was broken into two in the
middle due to the resultant jerk. The terrific sound then created was like that of a falling
thunderbolt."

Shlok 50: "Then and there, my father true to his promise decided to bestow me on Rama,
offering him a jar of pure water."

Shlok 51: "But Rama did not consent to accept my hand till the will of his father, the Lord
and the king of Ayodhya had been made known to him."

Shlok 52: Thereupon, my father-in-law and the aged Dasaratha was invited to Mithila by my
father and with his approval, I was bestowed on Rama, the knower of the self."

Shlok 53: "My younger sister Urmila, the virtuous lady of lovely looks was given as a consort
to Lakshmana by my father himself."

Shlok 54: "I was given thus to Rama in that Svayamvara, a process of self-choosing marriage. I
became devoted, by my good works, to my husband who is excellent among men of strength."



SARGA 119
------------------------------

[Text] As the evening twilight approaches, Anasuya sends Seetha to Rama's presence. Seetha
approaches Rama and shows him the apparel, jewels and garlands gifted by Anasuya and duly adorned
by her, Rama spends the night there along with Seetha Lakshmana. At the onset of dawn, they take
leave of the ascetics and advance further into the great forest in the route suggested by the
ascetics.

Shlok 1: Hearing that great story, Anasuya the knower of piety kissed Seetha's forehead and
hugged her in her arms.

Shlok 2: "It was narrated sweetly and amazingly by you, in clear words and syllables. It has
been indeed heard by me how all that Svayamvara, the process of self-choosing marriage took place.
O, the sweet speaking Seetha! I am overjoyed by hearing your story."

Shlok 3- 4: "O, Fortunate One! While the auspicious night drawing near, the sun has sunk below
horizon. The twittering of the birds can be heard, who, through the day, have sought their
nourishment far and wide and are seeking their shelter for sleep at the time of
evening-twilight."

Shlok 5: "These ascetics too are returning together, their bark-robes drenched from bathing,
and with uplifted vessels, wet with sprinkled water on them."

Shlok 6: "From the sacred fire kindled by the sages, according to the scriptural ordinance, a
column of smoke with the hue of a Pigeon's neck, raised by the wind, is seen there."

Shlok 7: "Thought their foliage is sparse, the trees look dense all around. The quarters of
the world, by whom the senses are drawn apart, do not shine brilliantly at this place."

Shlok 8: "The animals who wander about at night are ranging everywhere. The deer of the
hermitage are sleeping round the sacred altars."

Shlok 9: "O, Seetha! The night richly adorned with stars has set well in motion. The moon
encircled with light is seen rising in the sky."

Shlok 10: "Go now. I give you leave. Be a female companion to Rama. Your sweet conversation
has charmed me."

Shlok 11: "O, Seetha! O, Dear child! Adorn (with ornaments and apparel gifted by me_ before my
eyes and cause delight to me in embellishing yourself with heavenly jewels."

Shlok 12: Then Seetha, adorning herself, resembled the daughter of a god, and making obeisance
to the feet of Anasuya, she went forward to meet Rama.

Shlok 13: Rama, the most eloquent one, saw Seetha adorned as aforesaid and felt delighted over
the charming gifts of the ascetic.

Shlok 14: Seetha, the daughter of Mithila kingdom then showed to Rama all the apparel, jewels
and garlands the affectionate gifts of Anasuya the hermitess.

Shlok 15: Seeing the respectful treatment, received by Seetha, which was very rare among human
beings, Rama and Lakshmana the great car-warrior felt highly rejoiced.

Shlok 16: Thereupon, Rama with his face resembling the moon, having been honoured by the holy
ascetics, was delighted and spent that auspicious night there.

Shlok 17: While that night passed away, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men finished their
ablutions and took leave of the ascetics dwelling the forest, who had just poured oblations into
the sacred fire.

Shlok 18: Those ascetics dwelling in the forest and practising virtue told Rama and Lakshmana
about the region of that forest, which was infested with demons (as follows):

Shlok 19: "O, Rama! Various forms of man-eating demons and beasts drinking the blood are
living in this great forest."

Shlok 20: "O, Rama! They devour an ascetic or a celibate, who has not rinsed his mouth after
finishing his meal or who is inattentive in this great forest. (Pray ward them off!"

Shlok 21: "O, Rama! Here is the path of the great sages, through which they fetch the fruits
in this forest. It is appropriate for you to go by this path in this dangerous forest."

Shlok 22: Thus addressed by those Brahmanas having great asceticism, who, with joined palms
paid obedience to him and blessed his journey, Rama the harasser of his foes entered the forest
with his consort along with Lakshmana, as sun enters a mass of clouds.

ARANYA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------



Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are 
			in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved 
			over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are 
			the ultimate in Vedic culture.



Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama's exile is in aaryavarta , the place of noblemen, 
			from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area called janasthana,meaning 
			people's place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic 
			individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though 
			people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as 
			per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their 
			own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals.



The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of 
			Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, "The finding allows us for the first 
			time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals." It is not clear from 
			the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even 
			at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which 
			had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence 
			indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, 
			and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some 
			underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in 
			Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But 
			the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for 
			their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported 
			to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but 
			a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing 
			towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests.



When it comes to isms , it is said that the whole clash is between
			Vaishnavaites and Shaivites or
			Shaaktaites , because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism 
			is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons [in fact the term 'demon' do not suit them,] portrayed 
			hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity 
			of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything 
			that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down 
			by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama's war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will 
			be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity 
			that goes against any civility.

[Text] It is said that Rama performed diina jana rakshana in this Aranya Kaanda, Miserable 
			People's Protection and mitra jana rakshana in the next canto Kishkindha Kaanda, 
			i.e., Friendly People's Protection. The janasthana is the unexplored area by the then people of aaryavarta, 
			where the raakshasa ethnicity prevailed and which certainly resisted any outside influences or culture, and 
			which is why they are called raakshasa-s. The word raksha means protection, and 
			they protect their own culture and ethnicity, and if any outsiders to join them, they shall be subservient.For 
			e.g., Ravana does not tolerate the insult meted out by his sister Shuurpanakha at the hands of Lakshmana.Ravana, 
			though persuaded by Maareecha not to encounter Rama, does not listen to any advises but wished to abduct Seetha, 
			because he wanted to possess that beautiful woman, like all other beautiful, pompous objects like Kubera's wealth, 
			Lanka, the golden city and Pushpaka aircraft etc. Ravana even baits Seetha with queen-hood, if only she subjugates 
			to him, and all these dictatorial aspects reveal the pride and vanity of Rakshasa culture. But the term 'demon' 
			used in paucity of equivalent term may not be taken to mean just as a wicked demon or a devil, but a powerful 
			antagonistic culture or ethnic dominions of Rakshasas, in Janasthana.



Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, 
			and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient 
			commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence 
			much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically 
			and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what 
			we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected 
			by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It 
			may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, 
			the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create 
			havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, 
			with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra.

Shlok 1: On entering the impenetrable Dandaka forest that courageous and unassailable Rama saw a clusters of hermitages of sages. 
[3-1-1]

[Commentary] The word aatmavaan is the question Valmiki put to Narada at the start of the epic in Bala Kanda, as the first word 
of verse 1-1-4. The courage and invincibility are reflected in the opening verse of this canto, since Rama has to perform
diina jana or sajjana rakshaNa i.e., saving the helpless or goodly men, viz. in the present context, the 
sages. The sages are to be saved from the onslaught of demons, which requires, both courage and un-invincibility. Apart 
from the above aatmavaan normally means sagacious one.

Shlok 2: Overspread with Darbha, the sacred grass, and jute clothing, well pervaded with Vedic splendour and well glowing like the 
un-seeable solar arena in the sky, with naked eye. [3-1-2]

[Commentary] This connotes Vedic import in saying that Supreme is far beyond from Solar orbit. In iishaavaasyopanishad , at 
hymn 15, we hear the following mantra , hymn:



On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking "Oh! Pooshan! God Sun, nourisher of the universe, the trueness of 
the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like vessel, [i.e., your Solar disk,] slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous 
devotee, I visualize [that which is beyond your golden Solar disc.]

[Commentary] This is said to be the coming of Supreme into lower abode of Solar orbit from His Supreme abode, say vaikuNTHa. 
Now Rama and Seetha are passing through this dazzling Solar-orbit like hermitage, to present themselves before the true 
devotees, and even to eradicate vice on earth. This appearance is without any prayers from the devotee, as contained in 
the above Vedic hymn. God reveals Himself

Shlok 3: Those hermitages have well-tidied thresholds on all sides, dense with many deer and teemed with many groups of birds, and 
they are the recourse for all living beings. [3-1-3]

Shlok 4: Those hermitages are always adored by groups of apsarasa-s with their continued dancing, their Holy Fireplaces are very 
broad, and are with oblation items, vessels, deerskins and sacred grass, and they are beaming forth with gigantic trees 
that yield sacred and palatable fruits, and with ritual fuels, and water vessels, tubers and fruits. [3-1-4, 5]

[Commentary] The Vedic ritual demands three Fireplaces called tretaagni , three fires. They are dakshiNa agni Southern 
Fire; gaarhapatya agni Household Fire; aahavaniiya agni Invocation Fire. These three are lit day in and 
day out, symbolising that the fire in living beings has continuity. Wherever a Vedic ritual takes place the celestials will 
come to take their share of oblations and the celestial dancers dance thereabout in praise of the ritual. The oblation vessels 
are of particular nature and a long spoon is made of particular wood, to oblate clarified butter or milk etc., into the 
Alter of Fire. The deerskin is the prescribed seat for meditation. The sacrificial grass is the essential item of even in 
domestic rituals, symbolising that the human kind shall prosper like the interlaced and intermingled grass, where the starting 
or the end point is intractable.

Shlok 6: Those hermitages are sacrosanct for Ritual fire is being worshiped with fire-oblations and sacrifices to the reverberating 
Vedic sounds, and they are enwrapped with lotus ponds with lotuses, and even with flowers of forest. [3-1-6]

Shlok 7: They have age-old saints with controlled senses who are clad in jute cloths and deerskin, and who subsist on fruits and 
tubers alone, ye their resplendence is like that that of the Sun-god or the Fire-god. [3-1-7]

[Commentary] This chiira is the Sanskrit word for the present day sari and it is still called as chiira in 
some parts of India.

Shlok 8: Rama has seen such a cluster of hermitages that is glistening forth just by the presence of holy saints whose sustenance 
is constrained, and that hermitage is distinctive like Brahma's abode, reverberating with the sounds of that Brahma's Vedic 
chants alone. [3-1-8]

Shlok 9-10a: That glorious and great resplendent Rama on seeing those precincts of hermitage that is graced with highly blest Brahmans, 
the knowers of Brahma, neared it, unstringing the bowstring of his great bow. [3-1-9-10a]

Shlok 10b-11a: Those great sages, the possessors of divine knowledge, are gladdened on seeing Rama and illustrious Seetha, and they moved 
towards them welcomingly. [3-1-10-11a]

[Commentary] Indian archers fasten the bowstring only when that bow is to be put to use. Further there is a method described in dhanurveda 
as to how a bowstring is to be fastened to the other end of the bow. The Indian mythological bows are of six feet or two 
yards, in height. It is also a measure like horse length. The string, which so far is spiralled to the bow beam, is to be 
removed. Then the bottom end of the bow is to be kept pressed onto the ground with left foot's big toe. Then with the right 
hand the edge of the string is handled and with left hand the other end of the bow is to be held and crouched, so that the 
string can be hooked or fastened there. After fastening, the stretch of the string is to be tested [like the occasional 
testing of the badminton or tennis racquet for the tension of its gut,] by pulling and leaving it, so that it makes a warring 
sound. By this sound of the bowstring, which is a signal to the opponent, the opponent comes to know as to who is handling 
which bow. Then if the archer is going to beam out an arrow, he shall pull the arrow on the bowstring up to his right ear 
and leave it, aakarNaanta prayoga . Here, removing the bowstring from its fastening implies that this archer, namely 
Rama who is so far handling the stringed bow, for he is roaming in forests, and since he is entering the place of elderly 
saints now, unfastened the bowstring in all his humbleness to sages and saints.

Shlok 11a-12: But those sages who are austerely committed to vows, on their seeing Rama, the treader on the path of rectitude, and who 
is now arising like moon, and at Lakshmana and at glorious Seetha as well, rendered Vedic blessings and welcomed the trio. 
[3-1-11a-12]

[Commentary] This context is also explained in the following ways:

Shlok 13: Those forest-dwelling sages saw the physical built, its augustness and gracefulness, and his fine attire remaining in astonished 
postures. [3-1-13]

[Commentary] Here ruupa is the bodily shape that which, though undecorated, looks richly decorated. samhanana is beauty 
of the well arranged body parts with no dissimilarities, where the good old saying 'equality is the basis of beauty, and 
inequality is the basis of society...' may be remembered. lakshmiiH is laavaNya i.e., self-luminous augustness. 
While saukumaarya is the delicacy, like that of a blooming flower. suveSa is a neat and tidy outfit or 
suitable outfit. Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana wear a particular dress, given by Queen Kaikeyi in Ayodhya. Those dresses are 
peculiar to themselves and not on par with the regular dress of hermits. This dress of these three itself is a confusing 
attire for onlookers, like demon Viradha, or monkey-chief Sugreeva, for these three do look like neither perfect sages nor 
perfect warriors. Even the demon Viradha scorns them in the next chapter, for the inconstancy in their attire and their 
wielding weapons.

Shlok 14: The forest-dwellers saw Seetha, Lakshmana and Rama, without a wink on their own eyes, as that trio is causing surprise with 
their arrival.



The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [like celestial beings, who do not 
have the winking property on their eyes like living beings,] as their arrival is causing surprise.



The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [as though the Vishnu along with Goddess 
Lakshmi and Thousand headed-serpent, aadi sheSha are coming from their abode
vaikunTha to this hermitage, for this hermitage is like Brahma's abode, as already said, thus 
the sages lost their wink. And loosing any single wink will loose the sight of these divinities from
vaikunTha; hence their unannounced arrival caused surprise in them, which further caused a 
wink-less state [3-1-14]

Shlok 15: Those august sages that are interested in the well being of all beings have indeed accommodated Rama in that hermitage, 
as Rama is their guest a priori. [3-1-15]

Shlok 16: Then those august sages who are similar to sacred fire in glow have procedurally accorded guestship to Rama, and fetched 
water for him. [3-1-17]

Shlok 17-18a: On sounding out Vedic blessings those virtuous sages have offered flowers, fruits and tubers, and even the entire hermitage 
to that great soul Rama, and then with their palms adjoined. [3-1-17-18a]

Shlok 18b-19a: "The king will have great renown for he is the ruler of the righteousness of these people, a protector, a respectable and 
adorable one, and as he wields the sceptre of justice, he is a revered one too... [3-1-18-19a]

Shlok 19b-20a: "The fourth part of Indra is the protector of people, called the king, and hence Oh! Raghava, the king is hailed, and hence 
he enjoys best and delightful fortune... [3-1-19b-20a]

[Commentary] Here, Rama may be astonished as to why these forest dwelling sages eulogise him so much. The sages are not using unnecessary 
conversation and they are informing Rama what a king shall be, whether he is in the capital or in forests. The term Indra 
is an allusion to the 'Ruler'. It refers to seven more rulers or ruler like associates of Indra, ashta dikpaalaka-s. 
It is said that:

[Commentary] A king is made with eight aspects of eight rulers of eight corners of the universe. Viz., indra, vaayu [Air,]
yama Death-god suurya Sun, agni Fire, varuNa Rain chandra Moon, and kubera 
Wealth. When the earth is heading towards anarchy, Brahma is said to have created the king with one fourth of resplendence 
of each of the eight rulers. Manu Srmriti states as below:

[Commentary] Manu smriti also prescribes certain rules for the king called Vrata. Indra accords rains for four months to sprout the seeds, 
so the king shall sprout the people's hopes. Sun evaporates earthly water slowly and insignificantly so as to give the next 
rain, so the king shall collect taxes and spend them again for the welfare of people suurya vrata . Air pervades 
everywhere to enliven people, so the king shall pervade everywhere through his agents to watch out good and evil for his 
subjects maaruta vrata . Yama, the God of Time, has no friends or foes and ends the lives of any one at the end 
of their time, and so shall the king in according punishments yama vrata . Rain binds one and all and it is the 
livelihood of any living being, so is king to bind his subjects for a good livelihood varuNa vrata . Moon is both 
a pleasant one and presiding deity for medicinal herbs, so shall the king be pleasant to his people and keep their health
chandra vrata . Fire is fiery and burns down evil and the king shall be fiery to his enemies, either internal or 
external aagneya vrata . The earthly earth sustains scholars and stupid, wealthy and poor, prosperous and pathetic 
alike, so shall the king bear with all of his subjects pR^ithvii vrata

Shlok 20b: "You alone have to protect us as we are the subjects living in your kingdom..May you be in the capital... or in the forest...you 
are our king... [3-1-20b,c]

Shlok 21: "We gave-up punishments, either physically or by the power of curses, conquered are our anger and senses, and our ascesis 
is the only wealth of ours, thus oh! King, we are to be protected by you, like the foetus inside a womb... [3-1-21]

Shlok 22: Thus saying they worshipped Raghava along with Lakshmana, on giving fruits, tubers, flowers and other varieties of forest 
foods. [3-1-22]

Shlok 23: Thus other saints and sages who are the followers of the virtue, and similar to the Sacred Fire adored Rama, the king, according 
to the wont of custom. [3-1-23]



SARGA 2
------------------------------

[Text] Viradha the demon confronts Rama and other and tries to abduct Seetha, and
          then Rama. The killing of this Viradha is the first act of Rama in eliminating negative
          forces in his empire to establish Rama Raajya. This killing is also a gift to Sage
          Sharabhanga, whom he meets later, as per the meaning of verse I-1-41 of Samkshepa
          Ramayana contained in Bala Kanda. Rama thus started to act freeing the saints and sages
          in forests, and the forests themselves, from the cruelties of demons. Viradha is a demon
          by curse and a devotee Goddess Lakshmi, now incarnate as Seetha. Hence this demon wanted
          to own his goddess and hence lifts Seetha into his hands to abduct her away from Rama.
          But Rama and Lakshmana overpower and eliminate him, rescuing not only Seetha, but also
          other saints and sages living thereabout.

Shlok 1: Then, on receiving the hospitality in that hermitage for that day, and on the next
  day before sunrise, Rama bade farewell to all of the sages, and thus entered the deep forests.
  [3-2-1]

Shlok 2-3: Rama followed by Lakshmana has indeed seen that midst of the forest which is
  filled with very many animal herds, where the bears and tigers are frequenting, and whose trees,
  creepers, bushes are ruined, water ponds rendered unsightly, birds song-less, but where the
  swarms of crickets are whistling deafeningly. [3-3-2, 3]

Shlok 4: Therein Rama has seen along with Seetha, a lurid voiced man-eater who is akin to a
  mountain-peak, among horrendous animals. [3-2-4]

Shlok 5: Deep eyed, huge mouthed, horrible with a monstrous belly, hideously misshapen, and
  a very soaring one that demon is, an ugly one with a horrendous look. [3-2-5]

Shlok 6: Wearing tiger's skin that is wetted with fat and dampened with blood, he is
  frightening to all beings like the wide-open mouth of Death. [3-2-6]

Shlok 7-8a: He skewered three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten spotted deer, and a big head
  of an elephant with tusks and fouled with fat on an iron spear, and he is yelling with his
  deafening voice. [3-2-7-8a]

Shlok 8b-9a: He that demon on seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha ran towards them very angrily,
  like the Time, the Eliminator of people. [3-2-8b-9a]

Shlok 9b-10a: He shouted a tremulous blare, as though to tremor the earth, and seized Vaidehi
  with his arms and gone afar, and then said this way. [9b-10a]

Shlok 10: "You two wear jute cloths like hermits, but handle arrows, bows and swords like
  warriors, yet entered Dandaka forest with your wife... your lives are on the wane...
  [3-2-10b-11a]

Shlok 11b-12a: "How saintly are you while living with your wife? You sinful fellows dishonest are
  you ways... who are you... you insulters of sainthood? [3-2-11b-12a]

[Commentary] This demon Viradha could not comprehend their identity prima facie. By their
  physique and carrying the bows and arrows, knives etc., they look like warriors. By their dress,
  hairdo, pendants etc., they look like sages. He has so far not seen a warring sage, like Bhargava
  Rama or Parashu Rama. These two men dressed like sages but look like warriors and are moving in
  the deadly forests with a wife. vi raadha , means without, love, a loveless one, and in
  another context it means that vi = verily, raadha adoring Krishna like Raadha.
  He is said to adore Goddess Lakshmi before he is cursed to become a demon, and finding that
  goddess in Seetha, he lifts her into his arms, like a baby. This demon while admonishing Rama and
  Lakshmana for flaunting the sainthood, for they are moving with weapons and a wife, he narrates
  about himself in next verses.

Shlok 12b-13a: "I am a demon named Viradha and I will be on the rove in this impassable forest
  with weapon, always eating the flesh of sages... [3-2-12b-13a]

Shlok 13b-14a: "This best waisted woman will be my wife, and I will drink your blood of you two
  sinful one in a fight with you... [3-2-13b-14a]

Shlok 14b-15a: On listening those arrogant words spoken in bad intent by that evil minded
  Viradha, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, is much panicked. [3-2-14b-15a.]

[Commentary] Here Viradha said that Seetha would become his 
 bhaaryaa
  which would
  translate into a 'wife' in routine manner. It is said that Viradha is a devotee of Goddess
  Lakshmi and it is not congruous for a devotee to say like that. Here, aascharya
  ramayana, another version of Ramayana, defines bhaarya as: bhaa luminous
  one; aryaaH adorable. Hence his word should mean, "this luminary is my adorable one."
  Further he handles Seetha like a baby, as in 3-2-16, she is said to be viraadha anka
  gata , gone into the arm-fold of Viradha as babies would. The peevish ones like Viradha or
  Ravana grab her very quickly for she is Goddess Lakshmi, the presiding deity of wealth.

Shlok 15b-16: Seetha in fear wiggled like a plantain tree in a whirlwind, and on seeing at the
  auspicious lady gone into the arms of Viradha, Raghava spoke this sentence to Lakshmana, with his
  face fully turning to pale. [3-2-15b-16]

Shlok 17-18a: "See! Gentle Lakshmana, see that illustrious princes Seetha, the daughter of
  emperor Janaka, one who is brought up comfortably in immense comfort, and my auspiciously
  traditional wife... now gone into the wretched hands of a demon... [3-2-17-18a]

Shlok 18b-19a: "That which is desired to befall on us, and that which is the choicest desire of
  Kaikeyi, and that which is concomitant to her boons, oh, Lakshmana, that has come to pass
  quickly, and today only Lakshmana... [3-2-18b-19a]

Shlok 19b-20: "She who is a foresighted lady, she who is not happy with the kingdom for her son,
  she by whom I, a dear one to all beings, am sent to forests, and she is my middle mother, her
  desire is fulfilled today, nay now itself... [3-2-19b-20]

Shlok 21: "To me, oh, Soumitri, the grief of others touching Seetha is more, than father's
  demise or grabbing away my kingdom... [3-2-21]

[Commentary] Here Rama says that 'my' kingdom is grabbed away, and now the grabbing away of
  Seetha is more painful, even somebody touching Seetha, the most. Rama did not loose heart to
  regain his kingdom. He underwent the course of what his father ordered and is definite of return
  to Ayodhya to rule back his empire. In the next canto Kishkindha, Vali the monkey hero questions
  Rama, as who he is to enter Kishkindha. To that Rama replies, "All the Bharata continent belongs
  to us, the Ikshwaku-s, and presently the emperor is Bharata, and hence on behalf of my emperor
  Bharata I slay you." There he is again confident of returning to capital after completing his
  exile. Hence claiming this kingdom as 'my' kingdom does not alter his status of emperor, though
  not now, but after the completion of exile he is to become one. Again Rama weighed the agony in
  terms of his father's death and grabbing away of his kingdom. Raajya Lakshmi, Kingdom Wealth is
  nothing before his wife, Wealth of Fortune, i.e. Bhaagya Lakshmi. Hence Rama is more bothered
  about his fortune wife than the retrievable kingdom, or the death of an aged father.

Shlok 22: When said thus by Rama, Lakshmana said this with flooding tears of lament, and in
  his anger hissing like a forestalled snake. [3-2-22]

[Commentary] Such portrayal of Lakshmana as a fundamentally angry person, like a hissing
  snake, and a sharp tongued one etc., are attributed in mythology to the serpentine character of
  aadi SheSa, the thousand headed serpent on which Vishnu reclines. The mythological
  derivation is that Lakshmana is the incarnation of that serpent, while Bharata and Shatrughna are
  the incarnations of the conch shell and disc that adorn the two upper hands of Vishnu.

Shlok 23: "Oh, Rama, you being the Indra like lord of all beings, and while you are being
  attended by an adherent like me, what for you worry yourself like a derelict? [3-2-23]

Shlok 24: "He will now be felled with my arrow as I am enraged at him, and gone are his
  lives now, and indeed the earth shall drink his blood... [3-2-24]

Shlok 25: "Indeed, that which anger was there to me on Bharata when he desired kingdom, that
  anger I will now release on Viradha, as Indra released his Thunderbolt on the mountain...
  [3-2-25]

Shlok 26: "Accelerated by my shoulder strength this ruinous arrow shall fall on his massive
  chest, thus life from his body shall decamp, and then he shall whirlingly fall onto the earth..."
  So said Lakshmana. [3-2-26]



The forest
  Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest.
  One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their
  kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and
  angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom.



Danda took refuge
  in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called
  Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage
  Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda
  reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite
  of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and
  curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta
  capital for a period of seven consecutive days.



Then there is a
  mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called
  Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is
  called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka
  forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as
  the protector of this dominion Jansthaana.



This is the place
  where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where
  Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the
  sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana,
  indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once
  belonged to Rama's kingdom.



SARGA 3
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana enter into a dialogue with Viradha, the demon and shower arrows on him. Later, Viradha, the demon carries 
Rama and Lakshmana away from Seetha.

Shlok 1: Then in his turn that demon Viradha said this sentence filling the forest with his gruesome voice, "I am asking you, really... 
tell me who you are and whereto you wish to go? " [3-3-1]

Shlok 2: Then that highly resplendent Rama said about his Ikshvaku dynasty to the blazing faced demon who is insistent. [3-3-2]

Shlok 3: "Know us as Kshatriya-s with ennobled bearing, and we are trekking the forest...but we wish to know about you, who are you 
that move about in Dandaka forest? [3-3-3]

Shlok 4: Viradha said to that truly valiant Rama, "Ah! I'll tell you, oh king, be informed of me, oh Raghava... [3-3-4]

Shlok 5: "I am the son of Java indeed... my mother is Shatahradaa, and all the demons on earth call me Viradha...'[3-3-5]

Shlok 6: "On my undertaking ascesis I derived a boon from the beneficence of Brahma, by which I will neither be cut, nor slit, nor 
killed with a weapon in this world..."[3-3-6]

Shlok 7: "Leave off this lady without any yearning for her, and you expeditiously flee-away as you have come, then your lives will 
not be snatched away... [3-3-7]

Shlok 8: Rama in reply said this to that ogre Viradha, whose eyes are fully bloodshot in anger, who is monstrous in his body, and 
evil in intent... [3-3-8]

Shlok 9: "You knave, fie upon you... you are in quest of you own death for your meanly measures, and definitely you will get it in 
this confrontation. Stay! I will not let you to live... [3-3-9]

Shlok 10: Then, stringing his bow Rama indeed darted very sharp arrows, very quickly and well aiming the demon... [3-3-10]

Shlok 11: Indeed seven arrows are let off with perfectly stringed bow, which have golden vanes, and very fast ones that equal the 
flights of Garuda, the Divine Eagle and the Air-god. [3-3-11]

Shlok 12: But, they the arrows that are akin to infernos and dressed with peacock feathers as their fins, on piercing the body of 
Viradha they fell onto the ground besmirched with blood. [3-3-12]

Shlok 13: When that demon is thus struck, then he placed Vaidehi down from his arms, hauled up his spear, and very angrily rushed 
towards Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-13]

Shlok 14: And holding fast his spear that is similar to the Indra's Flagstaff he blaringly yelled a ghastly shriek, and thus he shone 
forth like the wide-mouthed Death, ready-to-gulp. [3-3-14]

Shlok 15: Then with an effulgent arrow-rain those two brothers incessantly rained on demon Viradha, who is similar to the terminator 
of lifetime. [3-3-15]

Shlok 16: He that highly horrendous demon laughed at that arrow-shower, and standing for a while he yawned, and on his yawning and 
stretching his limbs in fatigue those arrows that earlier have gone speedily, spilled out from his body that speedily. [3-3-16]

Shlok 17: Demon Viradha held back his lives by the touch of boon, and raising up the spear he ran quickly at Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-17]

Shlok 18: The best wielder of weaponry Rama ripped that spear apart, which is akin to the Thunderbolt of Indra, and that which is 
like a blaze in the sky, with two arrows in the sky itself. [3-3-18]

Shlok 19: Shattered by Rama's blazing shafts that spear fallen on ground like the boulder mass of Mt. Meru when it is shattered by 
Indra's Thunderbolt. [3-3-19]

Shlok 20: They quickly upraised their swords and like a pair of up-swinging black-cobras they rapidly crashed on him, and then battered 
him mightily. [3-3-20]

Shlok 21: He that demon thus beaten very firmly by Rama and Lakshmana, then on grabbing those unwavering ones and manly tigers with 
his arms, that furious demon wished to carry them away. [3-3-21]

Shlok 22: Knowing the thinking of the demon for sure, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, "Let him easily carry us anywhere on his way... [3-3-22]

Shlok 23: "Let this demon carry us as he wishes, and Saumitri, by which way this night-walker goes, that alone will be our way... 
[3-3-23]

[Commentary] Rama does not want to travel comfortably on the shoulders of the demon, but wants to examine what the demon wanted to do 
next, after carrying afar. The prince in Rama will not let the demon go rampant. Besides, the divine fury allows any sinister 
to tread his own way towards his own grave.

Shlok 24: But he that night-walker arrogant as he is by his might has uplifted Rama and Lakshmana like babies by that might and courage 
alone, and placed them on his shoulders as one would place babies. [3-3-24]

Shlok 25: That nightwalker Viradha on placing those two Raghava-s on his shoulders gone towards deeper forest yelling very luridly. 
[3-3-25]

Shlok 26: That demon entered into a baffling forest that is like a very dark cloud in its sheen, where a variety of massive trees 
are contained in, numerous flocks of vulturine birds are overspreading, and where wild jackals and other predaceous animals 
are sprawling around, along with Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-26]







Ikshvaku dynasty is of long lineage. This is Surya Vamsha, Solar dynasty of Kshatriya-s, of which Mahaa Kavi Kalidasa wondered 
as to how it can be narrated, for it is of a long lineage and he admires kvaH suurya prabhavo vamshH... in his 
Raghu Vamsha Mahaa Kaavya, at 1-2. This dynasty may be known to understand why from Viradha to Ravana, wanted to die at 
the hands of Rama. The list of those kings is compiled in aananda raamayana and the same is being given hereunder...

SARGA 4
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana come to know about the curse of Viradha. Viradha desires to die in then hands of Rama according to the 
amendment given by the cursing authority, and thus he will be killed and relieved of his curse by Rama, and his elimination 
of negative forces starts with the elimination of Viradha. At the time of release from his curse, Viradha advises Rama to 
go to Sage Sharabhanga, who can advise Rama properly. It is said whenever a superior being is approached, he shall not be 
neared empty-handedly. So, the elimination of Viradha, first act of Rama to safeguard the diinajana 
parirakshana in Dandaka forests is the gift that Rama takes to the Sage Sharabhanga in next chapter. This is not 
a separate chapter in Baroda edition. But in Gorakhpur and Eastern versions it is a separate one.

Shlok 1: On seeing those two very dexterous scions of Kakutstha, and the best ones from Raghu dynasty, namely Rama and Lakshmana, 
grabbed and being carried off, Seetha screamed in a high-pitched voice.[3-4-1]

Shlok 2: "He that truth-abiding, virtuous, and the flawless Rama of Dasharatha is carried off along with Lakshmana by the demon with 
a ferocious look... [3-4-2]

Shlok 3: "Wild bears, tigers and panthers aspire to eat me away... oh, best demon, thieve me instead and release Kakutstha-s... Hail 
to thee..." [Said Seetha.] [3-4-3]

Shlok 4: On hearing Vaidehi's that utterance those valorous ones Rama and Lakshmana speedily busied themselves in eliminating that 
evil-minded demon Viradha. [3-4-4]

Shlok 5: Soumitri indeed severed the left arm of that ferocious one, while Rama rent the right arm of that demon with his might. [3-4-5]

Shlok 6: When his arms are mutilated that demon similar to a dark-cloud is frustrated, fainted, and fell onto ground, like the mountain 
demolished by the Thunderbolt of Indra. [3-4-6]

Shlok 7: They battered that demon with their fists, hands and feet, and even by heaving and hurling him again and again they entirely 
pounded on him on the ground. [3-4-7]

Shlok 8: Though that demon is battered with many arrows, even sheared off with two swords, and even though he is entirely pounded 
on the ground he is not killed. [3-4-8]

Shlok 9: On observing that the mountain-similar demon is ineradicable that easily, then Rama, the sublime one, and the bestower of 
shelter in fear, spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [3-4-9]

Shlok 10: "Oh! Manly-tiger Lakshmana, it is impossible to overpower this demon with weapons in a confrontation, hence, let's bury 
this demon... [3-4-10]

Shlok 11: "Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant... 
[3-4-11]

Shlok 12: On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...' then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and 
stood by. [3-4-12]

Shlok 13: On hearing that said by Raghava, demon Viradha sincerely spoke these humble words to Rama, the finest one from Kakutstha 
dynasty. [3-4-13]

Shlok 14: "Dead I am, oh! Manly-tiger and a coequal of Indra in your strength... I have fallaciously not identified you earlier... 
oh, best one among men... [3-4-14]

Shlok 15: "Oh, sire, now I have known you to be Rama, the son of Kausalya... and even propitious Seetha and greatly renowned one Lakshmana 
are now known to me... [3-4-15]

Shlok 16: "By curse I had to enter this ghoulish demon's body, but I am a celestial gandharva, named Tumburu and Kubera cursed me... 
[3-4-16]

Shlok 17-18a: "When entreated by me, he that greatly renowned Kubera said to me, 'When Dasharatha's Rama kills you in a fight... then 
you will attain your nature of celestial body and you will go to heavens...' [3-4-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: " King Kubera thus cursed angrily me for not presenting myself in his service when I was interested in a celestial dancer 
Rambha, and indeed he alone said this curse-clearance to me... [3-4-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: " And by your grace I am released from this utterly hideous cruse, and now I wish to go to my own heavenly abode, oh, firestorm 
of enemies, let safety betide you all... [3-4-19b, 20a]

[Commentary] The celestial beings are called sura and their antagonists are a-sura . There are many sura beings living 
in heavens and netherworlds. To name a few, they are uraga, garuda, gandharva, kimpurusha, siddha, saadhya, vidyaadhara, 
chaaraNa, apsara, yaksha, guhyaka, bhuuta, khechara and the like. Of them gandharva-s are amiable beings for their 
expertise in performing arts. The apsara beings are the divine courtesans and among them are four apsara beings of high 
order. They are Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka and Tilottama . These four are instrumental to Indra, to incite and allure 
sages from their austere penance, lest they may win over the ship on heavens from Indra. The present gandharva, namely Tumburu, 
in his courting with Rambha had belated his services to Kubera, the Chief Divinity for Wealth Management. Hence Kubera cursed 
this gandharva to become the demon called Viradha, but yet this Tumburu alias Viradha is the devotee of Goddess Lakshmi. 
The antagonists of sura are a-sura beings and all sorts of demons, monsters, etc., come under this category and they are 
not devils or Satan's stooges, but they equal the capabilities of sura beings. Prof. Ranade observes that "Dr. R.G. Bhandarkar, 
in an important article in the B.Br.A.S. Journal makes the following interesting suggestion. The Sanskrit equivalent of 
the word demon viz., 'Asurya' may here refer to the 'Assyrian' country. 'Assyrian and 'Asuryan' being philologically identical, 
the 'y' and the 'u' being interchangeable as in Greek..."

Shlok 20b- 21: "Oh, Sire, att one and half yojana-s of distance from here Sage Sharabhanga, a great saint of virtue, and an efficacious 
sage with sun-like resplendence dwells, you shall quickly approach him for he advises you opportunely... [3-4-20-21]

Shlok 22- 23a: "Rama you go safely on burying me in a pit... this is the age-old custom for those demons that lost vitality... those that 
are inhumed in pit, to them there will be the worlds of manes..." [3-4-22, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "And on saying thus to Rama that Viradha who is hurt by arrows became heaven-worthy on leaving his body. [3-4-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25- 26: And Raghava on hearing those words of the demon ordered Lakshmana, "Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and 
ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant..." On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...' 
then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by. [3-4-24b, 25, 26]

Shlok 27: Then, on taking a digging tool Lakshmana dug a deep pit beside the great soul Viradha. [3-4-27]

Shlok 28: On releasing his throat from the stamping of Rama, he that long eared, lurid voiced Viradha is ensconced in that pit while 
he is still blaring with his horrific voice. [3-4-28]

Shlok 29: Those deftly victorious ones Rama and Lakshmana who compose themselves in a given fight, both have gladly raised that Viradha, 
a ghoulish one in fight, a terrifying demon who is still blaring, with all their might and hurled him into the pit. [3-4-29]

Shlok 30: On observing the indestructibility of that demon with any weapon, however sharp it might be, those two best ones among men 
that are very expertly skilled have thought over well and undertook the elimination of that great demon in a pit. [3-4-30]

Shlok 31: Viradha himself preferred his death at the hands of Rama and desired for a long to be killed by Rama and that forest walker 
himself appraised that, "Killing me with any weapon is impossible..." [3-4-31]

Shlok 32: On listening to that which is said by Viradha, Rama resolved his mind to cast him into pit, and when that mighty demon is 
being flung into the pit the whole forest blared with that demon's cries. [3-4-32]

Shlok 33: Rama and Lakshmana felt happy by way of their look in burying Viradha in the pit of the earth, and on burying him they two 
felt rejoiced for gone is the fear in that great forest, and within the pit they have also concealed him with boulders in 
order to make it a burial-chamber to the departed soul. [3-4-33]

[Commentary] Everywhere Rama patiently performs these funeral rites, whether it is demon, eagle or a monkey, if dead in his presence. 
Here also, Viradha's grave is covered with stones and boulders, as a kind of Stonehenge.

Shlok 34: Then they two who have dazzling golden bows have eliminated that demon and retrieved Seetha, and they gladly journeyed on 
in that great forest like the two entities abiding on the skies, namely the Sun and Moon. [3-4-34]

[Commentary] The simile of sun and moon is of some importance. It will not be clear as to, who is compared with Sun and who with Moon, 
unless some ancient commentaries are touched. Rama is compared with Chandra, the Moon, because, Moon will not travel without 
his wives. All the celestial stars are the wives of the Moon, and they twinkle before the Moon's arrival, in order to welcome 
him into the night. Hence Rama is suffixed with Chandra, compounding to Sri Ramachandra. On the other hand, Sun does not 
travel along with his wife, namely Chaya, the Shadow, but she always will be at his hind. We the living beings are in between 
the Sun and his wife Chaya. If we face Sun in the morning times, she will be at our back, and in the evenings, when the 
Sun is at our back, Chaya, shadow will be in front of us, reminding us of our lengthening shadow of life. Thus we are in 
between the light and shadow. The Sun is also called karma saakshi, [Witness of Deeds.] Our own shadow, shortens with the 
ascending Sun and lengthens as the dusk of our day or life increases. Hence Sun's travel is wife-less one, and Lakshmana 
is thus compared with the Sun, for he does not have his wife travelling with him now. And Lakshmana is another karma saakshi 
[Witness of Events] in the Ramayana. In another way of commenting it is said that both of them are said to be moon-like 
in their appeasing personalities and sun-like in their radiant valour.



The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed 
that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill 
Viraadha. aadhyaatma raamaayana which occurs in the  chapter 61 of
brahmaanmda puraana also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama 
affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. 
A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from 
Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she 
is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess 
Lakshmi. Our concern here is with skaanda purana , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha's episode 
is explained detailedly. The skaanda puraana puts it as:



On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, " She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also 
release from the bondage [of demon's body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal 
Her ." etc. Hence vi raadha meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased 
and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama 
and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones 
the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees.



Again in skaanda puraana, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the phala shruti [Fruit 
of Listening] it is narrated as:



SARGA 5
------------------------------

[Text] Rama after killing demon Viradha enters the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, as advised by the dying demon Viradha 
			in the previous episode. Sage Sharabhanga refuses the invitation of Indra to come to heaven, but awaits the 
			arrival of Rama to see him with his own eyes. After seeing Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana, and also showing next 
			course of their journey, that Sage enters the yogic fire and ascends to Brahma's abode.

Shlok 1: After killing that stupendously mighty demon Viradha in forest, then Rama comfortingly embraced Seetha, and spoke to his 
brother Lakshmana who is beaming forth with resplendence. [3-5-1]

Shlok 2b- 3a: "Difficult is this impassable forest, nor we are forest inhabitants either... let's go quickly to that ascetically rich 
sage Sharabhanga..." [3-5-2b, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4: On his approach at the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, a sage with a divine effect and the one with a purified soul, saw 
a great wonder at the nearby of that hermitage of Sharabhanga.[3-5-3b, 4]

Shlok 5- 6- 7a: Rama has seen Indra, the lord of three worlds, with a radiant body that has the coupled radiance of Sun and Fire, mounted 
on a great chariot that does not touch the earth, wearing greatly brilliant ornaments and attired in spotless dress, while 
the other divinities are attending, and many more selfsame great-souls are worshipping him. [3-5-5, 6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8: Rama saw at his very nearby a chariot yoked with green horses that traverses in firmament, which in its splendour is either 
like the noontime sun, or a cluster of silver clouds, or like the silvern sphere of the moon. [3-5-7b, 8]

Shlok 9- 10a: He saw the stainless parasol of Indra, marvellously garlanded and shining forth, and the exemplary and invaluable royal 
fanning instruments with golden handles, which two best female celestials are handling and fanning at Indra's head sides 
with them. [3-5-9, 10a]

[Commentary] Comment: The royal umbrella and fanning instruments of Hindu order are of particular type, in comparison with their European 
counterparts. These chamara instruments will be made from the bushy long, silver-white hair of chamara animal, a Himalayan 
beast, [Bos grunniens] and the hair will be studded into a golden or silver handle. These are not for actual air circulation 
but they are royal insignias.

Shlok 10b- 11a: And the celestials like gandharva-s, amara-s, siddhaa-s and very many great sages as well are extolling Indra who is abiding 
in firmament. [3-5-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On seeing Indra speaking there to sage Sharabhanga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana. [3-5-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13: Rama then on pointing out the chariot expressed his own amazement saying, "Lakshmana see this wonderful chariot that includes 
effulgence and auspiciousness as well, and that abides in firmament, and highly luminous like the Sun... [3-5-12b, 13]

Shlok 14: "Of which horses we have earlier heard from our teachers telling that they belong to Indra, the Chief Invitee in Vedic rituals, 
they are these divinely green horses that now abide in the firmament, and definitely these must be Indra's horses... [3-5-14]

Shlok 15- 16- 17: "And oh, manly-tiger Lakshmana, those that are there in hundreds and hundreds around Indra, those youthful ones with their 
ear-ornaments and swords in hands, with wide and broad chests, with club shaped arms, and clad in glimmering red garments, 
all are like tigers, all are unapproachable, all of them are wearing ornamental chains on their chest-place that are akin 
to flaring fires, and in their appearance, Soumitri, they always bear a look of twenty-five-year-olds... [3-5-15, 16, 17]

Shlok 18: "The age factor of gods remains constant at the age that appears for these nice-looking Tigerly-men, so they say... 
for gods are immortals and they will be ever young... [3-5-18]

Shlok 19: "Stay for a moment Lakshmana along with Vaidehi, until I know clearly about that resplendent one on that chariot... [3-5-19]

Shlok 20: On saying to Lakshmana stay there only...' Rama proceeded towards the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga.. [3-5-20]

Shlok 21: Then, on seeing Rama arriving there, Indra, bade farewell to Sage Sharabhanga and said this to the celestials attending 
him. [3-5-21]

Shlok 22- 23: "Here comes that Rama...before he talks to me, you lead him towards his vow, after completing the result of his incarnation, 
then only he is eligible to see me... Let him be a victorious and accomplished one, then I will see him very soon...for 
that will happen very soon... A great deed is to be verily performed by him that is highly impossible for others... [3-5-22, 
23

[Commentary] Comment: This verse in Gorakhpur version is said to be containing improper word placements thus confusing in its meaning. 
Some ancient manuscripts are said to contain this as,

[Commentary] The same verse in Dharmaakuutam is like this,

[Commentary] In any case, the import is this "Now he that Rama can not talk to me, and after getting the results of his incarnation, 
i.e., elimination of Ravana, then only he can see me..."

Shlok 24: Then that Enemy-destroyer Indra adoringly bade farewell to the sage, and travelled to heavens by the chariot with its green 
horses. [3-5-24]

[Commentary] Comment: Vishnu is said to have instructed all the divinities to not to talk to him during his human incarnation on earth 
as Rama. If any divine being comes into direct contact and conducts a dialogue, Rama's identity as Vishnu is revealed, and 
Ravana will apprehend that and then revokes his boon of not to be killed by any divine being. As long as Ravana believes 
Rama to be a human being, so long he dares any human to confront, because he slighted humans when seeking his boon. Ravana 
can be ended only by Rama, but not by others. Hence, Indra departed from there before the arrival of Rama.

Shlok 25: On the transit of that Thousand-eyed Indra, Raghava with his adherents [namely Lakshmana and Seetha,] came nearby the 
Sage Sharabhanga, who is sitting nearby the altar of fire. [3-5-25]

[Commentary] The word paricChada means, that which encloses anything, apart from its ordinary meaning, attendants, retinue etc. Here 
the enclosures for Rama are Seetha and Lakshmana. As with any deity in a sanctum sanctorum, who is enclosed by impregnable 
walls and sanctimonious atmosphere, Rama is enclosed by that impregnable Lakshmana like a firewall, where the sanctimonious 
environ is the presence of Seetha, near at Rama.

Shlok 26: Touching the feet of that Sage Sharabhanga Rama along with Seetha and Lakshmana, and duly permitted and invited by that 
Sage Sharabhanga they sat there, as they obtained a shelter. [3-5-26]

Shlok 27: Then, Raghava enquired with sage about the arrival of Indra and Sage Sharabhanga narrated all that to him. [3-5-27]

Shlok 28: "Oh! Rama, that boon-giver Indra wishes to take me to Brahma's abode, which is achieved by me by my arduous ascesis and 
that which is unattainable for them with their souls unconquered... [3-5-28]

Shlok 29: "On knowing that you are course is nearby, oh! Manly-tiger, and without seeing my dear guest I do not wish to go to Brahma's 
abode... [3-5-29]

[Commentary] Sage Sharabhanga, with his sixth sense came to know that Vishnu is coming this way and will become his dear guest. He thus 
is obliged to receive Rama in his hermitage. It is his first priority than escaping to Brahma's abode. The sage with his 
own arduous penance attained that travel to Brahma's heavens and he can go there anytime. But seeing Rama, who is now a 
human incarnate, with his own human eyes is prime ordeal to that Sage. Secondly, ascending to heavens with mortal body is 
an impracticable affair. Hence the mortal body is to be cast off here only. If that mortal body is cast off, as per the 
request of Indra, the sage's mortal eyes cannot see Rama, for Rama leaves this earth after fulfilling his vow of eradicating 
evil, and equally, a Sage of high order like Sharabhanga, on going to Brahma's abode will not return as an earthling. Hence 
seeing and receiving Rama is his priority now.

Shlok 30: " Having met with you, a virtuous one and a great soul as you are, oh, manly-tiger, I wish to go through undesirable lesser 
heavens to Brahma's abode, the highest [3-5-30]

[Commentary] In Gorakhpur version it is avaram, a+varam . The translation will therefore be 'undesirable heavens/lesser heavens...' 
If there is difference between paradise and heaven, this lesser one is paradise; the ordinary swarga of Indra, 
where the departed soul's merit is metered and count down starts with the enjoyment of heavenly comforts. As and when the 
accumulated merit neutralises there, that soul has to take rebirth in the karmic cycle. kshiiNe puNye martya lokam pravishanti... 
This sage does not wish to go there, because he earned fartherest heavens like Brahma's abode or tridiva patham 
etc., by his penance. And those lesser heavens are as cited by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita aabrahma bhavanaallokaaH punaraavR^itti 
na arjuna... 8-16: and here Krishna also says maam upetyatu... 'In me repose yourself...' This 'Me,' is
tridivam... and tripaadvibuuti , as cited by puruSa suukta n its hymn paadosya vishvaa bhuutaani, 
tripaadasya amR^itam divi...' etc. Dharmaakootam puts it as brahma lokam gamiSyaami tridivam deva sevitam... 
without separating this concept into two kinds of heavens, namely paradise and Brahma's abode. Hence there is nothing enjoyable 
in any of the said heavens, than having a glance at you. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 31: "Oh! Tigerly-man, non-diminishing are the abodes achieved by me either in Brahma's abode or yonder than paradise...you take 
them all...that are mine achieved by me ascesis..." So said Sage Sharabhanga to Rama. [3-5-31]

[Commentary] Comment: The sage is dedicating all his achievements of penance unto god, without any ahamtva buddhi , mine-ness. 
This is called phala samarpaNa. The fruits of pious achievements are to be dedicated in the divine without the 
concept 'I am the doer thus I shall enjoy...' Even in the daily worship we are supposed to dedicate all that we have done, 
with oblating water saying ' karomi yad yat sakalam parsmai naaraayaNaayeti samarpayaami... 'Whatever is done, 
in all its entirety, I dedicate it unto the Supreme...' And Govindaraja observes, whatever that is acquired by the sage 
is his wealth. So the heavenly abodes are his only wealth as of now, and they all are surrendered to Rama, as guest-worship.

Shlok 32: Thus said by the Sage Sharabhanga to that Manly-tiger Rama, being the scholar in all the scriptures he spoke this sentence 
to that sage. [3-5-32]

Shlok 33: "I alone can gain all those worlds, oh! Great Saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you... 
[Apparent meaning.] [3-5-33]



"I will however take all those worlds of yours, for you have waited for me and dedicated whatever you achieved by your penance 
at my tri-feet, as atithi satkaara, honouring guests - ' leaving 'the doer and doing' attachment, 
and without desire to enjoy the fruits of works, as a karma phala tyaagi . For now, show me 
a place to dwell in this forest like an ordinary human being - [Implicit meaning according to Govindaraja.]



"I will win-over all those worlds myself, as Kshatriya-s are not supposed to take any donations; they either have to won 
by them or acquire them for themselves, just show me a place to dwell - [Maheshvara Tirtha.]



"Everything merges in me alone, for I alone gave all these to you, and you also dedicated the same in me, without the concept 
of doer and doing - [which again is reiterated in Bhagavad Gita -labhatecha tataH kaamaan mayaiva vihitaan 
|| 7-22 ' All the desires of the adherent like Brahma's abode, immortality etc., are acquired at my grace.' for now show 
me a place to live - [Another concept. tani sloki.]

[Commentary] Comment: Thus aahara means gaining, win-over, or snatching, stealing. Hence Rama as a king refutes that donation, 
telling that he alone will acquire those worlds, in an explicit meaning, that conceals Rama's identity as Vishnu. Vishnu 
has Himself given those merits to this sage, as said in Bhagavadgita. Implicitly all the merits of earthly beings merge 
into that Absolute ultimately, and hence any fresh donation from the sage is negated. The dictionary meaning of aahara 
is provider, fetcher, and Vishnu Himself is the fetcher, provider. In another way, aahara is to take, or snatch 
away, or merge and thus Rama is said to express 'I snatch away everything and anything done by my true devotee...for he 
does not do it for his own sake...' This is said to be God's karma phala swiikaara 'receiving of the fruits of 
work...

Shlok 34: Thus said by Raghava, who is like Indra in strength, that supremely intellectual Sage Sharabhanga again spoke this sentence 
this way. [3-5-34]

Shlok 35: "Here, oh! Rama, a great resplendent sage named Suteekshna, lives in this forest...a virtuous and a self-disciplined one, 
and he will do something benignant to you... [3-5-35]

Shlok 36: "You approach Sage Suteekshna and to you he will arrange housing in his auspicious and dpleasant place woods of hermits... 
[3-5-36]

Shlok 37: " Following opposite to its flow you may follow this River Mandaakini that carries flower-ferries, then you can reach there 
at Sage Suteekshna's hermitage...] [3-5-37]

[Commentary] Comment: Mandaakini is the name of River Ganga, and hence any river with continuous flow is affectionately called Ganga, 
like Dakshina Ganga, Bhaagiirathi etc. So this name of Mandakini is to mean a river here, but not Ganga. Later in Kishkindha 
also River Pampa is called Mandakini, at times.

Shlok 38: "This is the only way, oh, manly-tiger, and oh, sire, see me for a moment, till I forsake these body parts of mine, like 
a snake casting its withered moult... [3-5-38]

[Commentary] Sage Sharabhanga said, eSha panthaa naravyaaghraH meaning that 'this is the only recourse, oh, manly-tiger.' Here 
Rama asked Sage Sharabhanga to show a place to dwell. Sharabhanga's hermitage itself will now become vacant after the sage's 
ascension to heavens. But it is not shown to Rama to stay, instead yet another distant place is shown. All these Sages and 
Saints show only one path that Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana have to travel, i.e., towards Ravana, the evil on earth. From 
here they are directed to Sage Suteekshna's hermitage, there from to Sage Agastya's hermitage, and there from, to still 
deeper place in forests, called Panchavati. According to Kaikeyi's banishment Rama need not travel this far, but could have 
resided in some near-about forests of River Ganga. But one after the other, either demons who became celestials or sages 
who are going to become divinities, all usher Rama southward, i.e., towards the dominions of demons, whom Rama has to eradicated 
from earth. 'If Rama were to enter into Panchavati, a powerful dominion of demons like Khara and Dushana, alleging their 
loyalties to Ravana, it is definite that an encounter will ensue and Rama will start eradicating one after the other, and 
ultimately ending with Ravana...' this appears to be the logic of all the sages. As such Rama is asked to go on travelling 
towards the evil side of the earth, for all of the sages know about Rama's destination

Shlok 39: Then that hymnist on invoking the sacred fire and offering oblations with clarified butter into it, that radiant sage Sharabhanga 
entered that sacred fire. [3-5-39]

Shlok 40: The fire burnt down that great soul Sharabhanga from head-hair to body hair and thus his shrunk skin, bones and whatever 
flesh and blood are there, they are also burnt completely. [3-5-40]

[Commentary] Then the question arises whether Sage Sharabhanga wilfully encompassed the sin of suicide or not? Not so, because it is 
said that his self-immolation is not in any mortal fire, but in some yogic fire, which he invoked and sanctified with hymns. 
If it were to be an ordinary pyre, the mortal body do not burn completely to ashes as the skull and vertebral bones remain, 
for immersion into holy waters after a while. Here it is said that nothing remained. Further scriptures lay it down that: 
Hence Sage Sharabhanga, having seen Rama, got that divine knowledge and there is nothing left for him to accomplish with 
his mortal body, and hence entered the holy fire. Those that are superior in character and virtue, even the of Fire, Agni 
Deva, cannot even touch, rather provides a coolant condition in His lap. It is the same with Seetha in Yuddha Kanda and 
it also happened with Queen Chandramati, the virtuous wife of Emperor Harishchandra, one of the forefathers of Rama. Thus 
said in Dharmaakuutam:



Those who obtained divine knowledge about this mortal body, and those that cannot practice anuSThaana their daily 
chores, or with any incapability, and those that have left house as holder, and desiccated, could give up their mortal bodies 
into fire, waters or falling from mountain peaks.

Shlok 41: He that Sage Sharabhanga, then reappeared as an youngster in the semblance of Fire, o\n resurrecting from that altar of 
fire he shone-forth. [3-5-41]

[Commentary] Comment: The age of celestial is always constant like twenty-five-year-olds, as said above by Rama at 3-5-17/18.

Shlok 42: He that Sage Sharabhanga, transcending the ethereal worlds of fire-worshippers, of saints, of great souls, and also of divinities, 
has ascended to Brahma's abode. [3-5-42]

Shlok 43: He that meritorious and best Brahman Sharabhanga has seen Brahma in Brahma's abode, and Brahma too, on seeing that Brahman 
happily spoke to him... "Welcome..." [3-5-43]



SARGA 6
------------------------------

[Text] After the heavenward journey of Sage Sharabhanga, Rama is approached by
          others sages and hermits. They inform him about the atrocities of demons around that
          place. They all ask Rama to eradicate the menace and Rama avows to do so, in order to
          keep up the tranquillity of those hermitages, and also to obliterate the menace of demons
          from earth.

Shlok 1: On Sage Sharabhanga attaining heaven, groups of sages assembled and approached
  Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, who is glowing with resplendence. [3-6-1]

Shlok 2: The sages called Vaikahanasa-s, [who are born out of the nails of Prajaapati, the
  first ruler of mankind,] also Vaalakhilyaa-s, [those born from His hair,] and those from the
  water of His feet-wash, and those that thrive on drinking rays of sun and moon alone, and those
  that pound with stones and others who thrive on leaves alone, are those sages... [3-6-2]

[Commentary] The 
 samprakshaala
  are kind of sages said be washing their interior
  body with water, a yogic measure called dhouli prakriya , and also otherwise attributed
  to wash their vessels after a meal, without preserving any food for the next meal, for god would
  automatically give their daily bread. The sages called ashma kuTTa, are that kind of
  sages who pound their bodies with stones, and thus they pound grain with stones.

Shlok 3: Some of them use their own teeth to grid the grain they eat, and some who perform
  ascesis in neck-deep water, and some who sleep with their head resting on their shoulders or on
  chests without using any kind of bed, and some who do not use any kind of beds either, and some
  who meditate without any repose sitting in an enclosure without any leg-space. [3-6-3]

Shlok 4: And some sages whose food is water alone, or air alone to some, like that some who
  meditate staying in sky and some who sleep on bare ground itself. [3-6-4]

Shlok 5: Thus some are dwellers on high-peaked places with their senses controlled, and
  some are wearers of wet cloths, always reciting name or hymn japa and like that some who meditate
  with five kinds of fire around them. [3-6-5]

Shlok 6: All have Vedic resplendence and firm yogic control, and they have arrived at the
  hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga for Rama. [3-6-6]

Shlok 7: Those virtuous sages coming together in groups neared Rama, the best beholder of
  virtue, and said to that supreme one in virtue. [3-6-7]

[Commentary] The word 
 abhi gamya
  is nearly approaching, coming nearby, at a
  destination that is Rama. The Omni-Luminescent, , emerged in Kakutstha dynasty as Rama. Knowing
  that, all the sages of higher knowledge have arrived at their 'destination' in this mortal world
  itself... Maheshvara Tirtha.

Shlok 8: "You are the supreme charioteer born in Ikshvaku dynasty hence you are the
  protector of earth under your control. As with Indra, the ruler of divinities you are a similar
  ruler for us. [3-6-8]



Though born in Ikshvaku dynasty you are the Supreme Charioteer, hence you are the
  same Supreme Charioteer of this Earth and earthlings too, as with Indra who protects divinities,
  you are our protector.

[Commentary] We have not heard of any chariot or horse being utilised by Rama, let alone in
  some episodes of his student days, because he is more a foot soldier than a horse/chariot rider.
  How these sages suddenly say that Rama is a speedy charioteer, is the question. This mahaa
  rathaH concept is on the analogy of Krishna the charioteer in Bharata. In Vedanta, the human
  body is frequently referred as ratha, as in ashva kraante rathaH kraante
  vishNukraante vasu.ndharaa... , Sec. I-37 Mahanaaraayano panishad: 'O, earth that is
  traversed by a horse [in Vedic rituals,] a chariot, [great souls, why they all when] Vishnu
  himself treaded on you as Trivikrama... hence I pray you...' Hence the chariot, drawn by the
  five-senses as its horses, and the earth are also brought and said here by sages.
  Krishna-Arjuna's chariot too had five-horses. Here the sages with controlled senses, namely
  horses, are asking the one who chariots/spins the earth and earthlings, to take off the children
  of lesser gods, namely demons, far away from humans where humans are god controlled species.

Shlok 9: "You are well renowned in all the three worlds by your repute and valour, and in
  you abounding are the virtues like truthfulness and devotion to your father, and even
  righteousness too, is there. [3-6-9]

[Commentary] The above is the apparent meaning. The subtext is "Are you, the supreme
  charioteer of Ikshvaku dynasty alone, like Indra for celestial beings? And are you the supreme
  charioteer of this earth and earthlings alone? Not so...you are the Supreme of the whole
  Universe, therefore your reputation is well known in all the three worlds. Thus you the
  Omni-Luminescent entered in Ikshvaku dynasty in the form of Rama, to perform your duties like
  abiding by father's word, with your usual qualities like abounding virtuousness, safeguarding
  dharma in respect of your own creation/ maintenance..." Thus this is the confrontation-like-
  addressing of the enlightened sages. Maheshvara Tirtha.

Shlok 10: "You are the great-souled one, knower of righteousness and a patron of virtue...
  such as you are, on approaching you we beg to state something for which we may please be
  excused... [3-6-10]

[Commentary] Special supplication to god is a waste. His mercy has to flows on its own
  accord. Why beg him to perform his own duty? If by mistake, an appeal is made to god to alleviate
  a personal problem, his pardon may to be begged, but he is not be begged to do favours. Here the
  sages on one hand say that 'you have come here in the incarnation of Rama to eradicate evil...'
  At the same time, they say 'we have an appeal for the same...' This begging off, is as per social
  custom, made to the apparent ruler of the kingdom, not to the innate Divine.

Shlok 11: "Oh! , very great a-dharma, wrongness, will occur to that king who takes the sixth
  part of the country's produce as cess, but does not safeguard his subjects like his own sons...
  [3-6-11]

[Commentary] "Protection of subjects is but natural to all kings, but some kings do so for
  a particular reason, hence this appeal of ours" thus say the sages...Govindaraja. "Though you
  incarnated yourself to protect the entire universe, so you have to protect us too...but why a
  special appeal of ours when you are duty bound... that means, we with an unbearable angst of ours
  make this appeal according to the social custom, but not to harass you. Hence we remind you,
  Rama, of your kingly duties to safeguard us..." Maheshvara Tirtha. atra a
  pramaadena prajaaH samrakShaNiiyaaH - rakShaNaat uttama loka avaaptiH - arakShaNe doShaH ca
  bhavati iti suucitam - dharmaakuutam

Shlok 12- 13: "A king shall treat all the subjects of kingdom as his own sons, and he shall
  protect them as though he is ready to save them at the cost of his own lives, and he who will
  always be endeavouring in that manner will attain permanent renown lasting for many for many
  years to come, and thereby he attains a prosperous place even in Brahma's abode... [3-6-12,
  3]

Shlok 14: "He who righteously protects his subjects will get one fourth of the merit of
  great duty-bound deeds performed by each individual sage, say yajna-s, ascesis, meditation etc.
  performances. [3-6-14]

Shlok 15: "O, Rama, though you are there as protector for the hermitages, suchlike this one,
  where the most reverent Brahmans are there numerously, they look as though forsaken, for they are
  being demolished by demons, devastatingly... [3-6-15]

Shlok 16: "Come and see many of the bodies of the sages, the contemplative souls, that are
  variously killed by ghastly demons in the forest... [3-6-16]

Shlok 17: "At Pampa riverside, and alongside of River Mandakini, and at the surroundings of
  Mt. Chitrakuta also, this hideous warfare is being done... [3-6-17]

Shlok 18: "Thus. we are not able to tolerate this injustice to the sages, being executed in
  this forest by the demons with fiendish deeds, in a ghastly manner... [3-6-18]

Shlok 19: "Therefore we present ourselves before you as you are our protector, for the
  purpose of your protecting us that are being killed by nightwalkers... please safe guard us...
  [3-6-19]

[Commentary] It is said as 'you are the only refuge' because there is no pre or post verbs
  for this sharaNyam, thus you aare the protector of all worlds. sharaNa artham
  is taken as to 'place us at our appropriate place,' namely in the abode after total salvation;
  sam upasthitaa or sam upaagamaa as in other versions, we have come here with
  vishvaasa, faithfulness, sharaNaagati , servitude, kainkarya ,
  surrender etc.; naH paripaalaya protect us and with this word, it is again repeated in
  next verse as paripaalaya naH ; and later in the verse the request - from what to be
  protected is said. That is aniSTa nivR^itti ruupa phala praarthana, 'removal of that
  which is undesirable.' That is to say: 'we better be given total salvation rather than killed by
  these demons, which is half way through our exercise to attain total salvation.' is the subtext
  of the speech of sages.

Shlok 20: "Other than you, oh, valorous Rama, no way-out is deducible on this earth, hence
  oh, prince, protect all of us from the demons... [3-6-20]

[Commentary] There is no way-out on this earth, for that matter of fact in all the
  universe, when the 'earth' becomes upa lakshNa for all worlds. This is in consonance
  with the scripture's saying, na anyaH panthaa vidyate ayanaaya...puruSa suukta R.V. X-90
  and thus those sages say 'we are contaminated with limited fruition of our practices parimita
  phalatva, and other suchlike limitations. But you are evident here...before our naked
  eyes...so protect us from the demons...' where the demons, raakshsebhyaH comes to mean
  sarva aniSTaaH, all earthly undesirables. Again coupled with the vocation of 'Oh
  Prince...' it is said as: "you have come here like a prince of Ayodhya, unlike a wild boar, or a
  fish or a man-lion, your earlier incarnations, so remember us and give us salvation...

Shlok 21: On hearing all that is said by the sages of great penance, he that virtue souled
  Rama said this unto all of the sages. [3-6-21]

Shlok 22: "Unapt is this way of speaking to me...command me, for I am at your behest... just
  for my personal purpose I had to enter the forests.... [3-6-22]

Shlok 23: "I entered this forest as ordered by my father and even to obliterate the
  unconscionable state of yours owing to the misdeeds of demons. [3-6-23]

[Commentary] Rama's saying that 'I am at your command, oh sages...' is indicative of his
  nature of bhakta jana vashya... in the control of his ardent devotees, so no special
  prayer for salvation is needed. In the expression kevalene aatma/sva kaaryeNa... the
  word kevala is not a kevala pada ... just a word... it indicates a radical
  sense, like 'for that purpose only' meaning to eradicate demonic menace only, I entered the
  forest...' Because the sheSin has to come to the rescue of sheSi, the servant.
  So 'safeguarding my own servants is my own responsibility and also pleasure, that is why I
  entered the forests, where my father's orders are nimitta, a concomitant factor, and not
  that I entered these forest due to my karma, or misfortune...' Govindaraja. According to
  Maheshvara Tirtha 'My coming to forests at the orders of my father is a fact but concomitant
  factor in this forest trek is your request to eliminate the demons, which I will do...' This is
  evident meaning. The latent one is "I have entered these forests only at my own desire to
  eradicate demons, for they are doing wrong to you, my servants sheSin-s, and I abide by
  you, my devotees...' c.f.,

[Commentary] Griffit's Translit: I wait the hests of all of you. / I by mine own
  occasion led / This mighty forest needs must tread, / And while I keep my sire's decree / Your
  lives from threatening foes will free.

Shlok 24: "Perchance I have come for the achievement of your purpose, such as I am, dwelling
  in this forest will immensely be fruitful to me... [3-6-24]

Shlok 25: "I wish to eliminate demons, the enemies of sages, in war... let the sages behold
  my valour, and my brother's valour in doing so..." Thus Rama promised the sages. [3-6-25]

Shlok 26: Thus giving his aegis to the sages, that valiant Rama who is firmly virtue-souled,
  journeyed towards Sage Suteekshna with Lakshmana and the sages, and along with the one given by
  Honourable Janaka, namely Seetha. [3-6-26]



SARGA 7
------------------------------



Rama arrives at the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna, as directed by Sage Sharabhanga in 
the previous chapter and asks the sage to show a place to dwell. Suteekshna asks Rama to stay at his 
own hermitage, which has no other problems than the wild animals that come in herds and make blaring 
noises. Rama wishes to kill those animals that hamper the tranquillity of hermits living therein, but 
having observed the kindness of Suteekshna towards those wild animals, however disturbing they may be, 
Rama refrains to kill them, and would like to go to any other place than this. They spend that night 
there.

Shlok 1: Rama, the enemy-scorcher, has gone towards the threshold of the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna 
along with his brother Lakshmana and Seetha, also along with those Brahmans who accompanied him all 
the way. [4-7-1]

Shlok 2: He travelling on a long way, and on crossing rivers with plenty of waters has seen a 
tranquil mountain towering like great Mt. Meru. [3-7-2]

Shlok 3: Then those best ones from Ikshvaku dynasty, those two Raghava-s along with Seetha have 
entered the forest which will always be full with diverse trees. [3-7-3]

Shlok 4: Entering that perilous forest with its many a flower and fruit bearing trees, they have 
seen the hermitage in a reclusive place adorned with rows of jute cloths as though garlanding it. [3-7-4]

Shlok 5: There on seeing the ascetically rich Sage Suteekshna sitting in yogic posture with his 
body bearing lotus-like blotches of soil, Rama dutifully spoke to him. [3-7-5]

[Commentary] Here it is said the soil on the sage's body has taken lotus-like blotches. Certain 
yogic methods do not care outward bathing of body. Usually the bath is prescribed three times a day, 
but hermits of a sort leave away that bodily bathing, because the sweat and soil recurs immediately 
after each bath on this impure body. So they stop taking outward bath and concentrate on cleansing the 
inner space.

Shlok 6: "Oh! godly sage I am Rama, I have come to see you, hence oh, knower of virtue, oh, great 
sage, oh, one with truthfulness as your courage, please talk to me..." [3-7-6]

Shlok 7: Then that sage having seen that brave and best proponent of virtue, Rama, embraced him 
with both of his hands, and spoke this sentence. [3-7-7]

Shlok 8: "Welcome to you Rama, best of Raghu dynasty and the best patron of truth, and when you 
presently caught this hermitage unprepared this has become a well-lorded one... [3-7-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: "I am awaiting for you only, oh, greatly renowned one, without my ascent to heavens by 
casting off this body on the earth's plane, oh, brave one, for I have heard that you have arrived at 
Chitrakuta after you are repudiated from your kingdom... [3-7-9]

[Commentary] This heaven ' deva loka heaven is negated for total salvation. Total salvation 
is at your tri-feet, tridiva. So 'I have not ascended to heavens, which causes rebirth after 
the decline of merit, thus I am waiting for your arrival for Total Salvation, moksha...' So said the 
sage to Rama. Govindaraja. "You birthed in Raghu's dynasty for the elimination of Ravana, and also foregone 
your kingdom and you are coming this way. So I am waiting for your graceful look, without going to heavens 
leaving the body. Should I leave the body and go to heavens, I cannot see parama puruSa , The 
Absolute, in you... so I did not cast off this body...' Thus said the sage to Rama. Maheshvara Tirtha.

Shlok 10b- 11: "The king of gods and the chief invitee in hundred sacrifices Indra approached me, and 
that great deity said me that I have conquered all the worlds by my meritorious deeds... [3-7-10, 11]

Shlok 12: "Let me bequeath those worlds that are cherished by gods and sages alike, but which are 
won over by me by my ascesis, and you enjoy in them with your wife and with your brother Lakshmana... 
[3-7-12]

[Commentary] This sage Suteekshna too is dedicating all his merit accrued by his penance at the 
feet of Vishnu. This is the same effort of dedication, which Sage Sharabhanga offered, to Rama at 3-5-33 
of this canto. Any thing accrued by human effort and energy, if dedicated at the feet of god, is doubly 
meritorious and establishes a selflessness of the devotee. Even in any daily worship it will be concluded 
with a saying, ye tat phalam parameshwara arpaNamastu... i.e., whatever is the result of this 
worship it is dedicated in the Supreme...

Shlok 13: That self-respecting Rama replied the radiant sage with intense asceticism, a great soul 
and an advocate of truth by himself, as Indra would reply to Brahma. [3-7-13]

Shlok 14: "I alone can gain all those worlds, oh, great saint, I now seek a place to dwell here 
in this forest as indicated by you... [3-7-14]

[Commentary] This is the same situation with Sage Sharabhanga in the 5th chapter of this canto. 
This is an allusive saying by Rama. cf. 3-5-33.

Shlok 15: "You are an expert in all affairs, and you are interested in the welfare of all the beings, 
so said the great souled Sage Sharabhanga of Sage Gautama's dynasty..." [So said Rama to the sage.] 
[3-7-15]

Shlok 16: When said thus by Rama, that great sage with world renown spoke sweet worded sentence 
with great pleasure. [3-7-16]

Shlok 17: "You can take delight in this good featured hermitage alone, for groups of sages will 
always be moving here, and this always contains tubers and fruits..." Thus said Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-17]

Shlok 18: "But herds of very large animals will be coming to this hermitage, they return after 
scaring us, of course without killing anyone, and they fear none... [3-7-18]

[Commentary] There is something in this verse. Some translations read mR^iga as deer, 
while some others read it as animals. If they are just deer, the word a + hatvaa , without 
killing, is of no use, for deer is not a carnivorous animal to kill someone. In other versions, this 
verse is a complete recast telling that herds of great size animals come and blare, but do not kill 
or fear any one. Even if it were so, this sage has got a tolerance for them too. And if some latent 
meaning is picked up, the large herds of deer, moving as they like in this hermitage, are said to be 
'luring' the sages, lobhayitbvaa. A presumption arises here. This must be the same 'lure' Seetha 
got on seeing Golden Deer. But Rama raises his bow and arrow to kill these animals that disturb tranquillity 
of hermitage, whether it be deer or other blaring wild animals. So Rama's fury must be at the 'luring 
deer', say Golden Deer, but not at ordinary deer. Thus this usage of 'deer and lure' may be taken as
lakshaNa for lakshita of Ramayana.

Shlok 19- 20a: "Know that no other problem is there other than the animals..." So said the sage. On 
hearing those words of that great sage, that brave elder brother of Lakshmana taking bow and arrow said 
this sentence. [3-7-19, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "I will eradicate them, oh, greatly blessed one, those animals that will come collectively 
in herds with sharp edged, curve-end arrows... [3-7-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: "But you may be more interested in those animals mercifully, then what will be there 
more painful to you, hence I deem our staying in this hermitage for along will be unbefitting..." So 
said Rama. [3-7-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23: On saying thus to the sage then Rama came by the twilight, and he paused at it. On worshipping 
the westward vesperal time, Rama arranged a stay for himself along with Seetha and Lakshmana, there 
in that delightful hermitage of Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-22b, 23]

Shlok 23: Then the great soul Sage Suteekshna on completing his evening rituals and on observing 
the fall of night he himself courteously served food that is auspicious and worthy of sages to two of 
the best men, Rama and Lakshmana. [3-7-23]

[Commentary] It may not be construed that Seetha is served with no food, by taking the wording 
that 'two of best men are served food' by the sage. It is usual for the Indian women to take food after 
their husbands or other dependents take it first, then all womenfolk in the house join together to have 
their meal, [for a long time...of course, with their unending chit-chatting...]



SARGA 8
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and others, having spent that night in the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna, start to go from there 
on the next day morning, duly taking permission from the sage. While bidding farewell to Rama and others, 
Sage Suteekshna explains concern about the forests, which are rich natural gifts to human kind and tranquil 
abodes of hermits, and implicitly suggests to Rama, to somehow safeguard them from the demonic activities 
in this Dandaka Aranya, by whom these forests are rendered into graveyards, not even honourable graveyards, 
but stockyards for heaps of dead bodies, bones and skulls, for no faulty reason of the saints and sages.

Shlok 1: Rama along with Soumitri is well revered by Sage Suteekhsna, spent that night there and awoken in the 
morning. [3-8-1]

Shlok 2: Rama got up according to time along with Seetha and touched finely cool water with lotus-fragrance for 
morning bath. [3-8-2]

Shlok 3- 4: Then they all, Vaidehi, Rama and Lakshmana, on worshipping sacred fire and deities dutifully in the 
shelter of the sages in that forest and on seeing the dawning sun, they are reft of their blemishes, 
and then they approached Sage Suteekshna speaking this sentence gently. [3-8-3, 4]

Shlok 5: "We stayed here happily, oh, god, venerated by a venerable one like you, and here we come to ask your 
permission as we wish to journey on, as the sages are hastening us... [3-8-5]

Shlok 6: "We make haste to see the habitats of hermitages in their entirety, and even wish to see the sages with 
meritorious selves living in Dandaka forest... [3-8-6]

Shlok 7: "We wish to have your permission, and that of these eminent sages, who are ever virtuous, self-controlled 
by their ascesis, and who look like the veritable tongues of sacred fire... [3-8-7]

Shlok 8- 9: "We wish to proceed before sun attains an intolerable glare, like an unworthy person of unworthy lineage 
attains wealth in an improper way with much glare..." saying so Rama with Seetha and Lakshmana venerated 
at the feet of that sage Suteekshna. [3-8-8, 9]

Shlok 10: That eminent sage lifted them that are touching his feet, embraced them tightly, and said this sentence 
in all his friendliness. [3-8-10]

Shlok 11: "Proceed in an invulnerable way, Rama, along with Lakshmana, and with this Seetha while she follows 
you closely like a shadow... [3-8-11]

Shlok 12: "See the pleasant thresholds of the hermitages of the dwellers in the forests of Dandaka, oh! Valiant 
one, whose souls are consecrated just by their ascesis... [3-8-2]

Shlok 13- 14- 15: "See the well-flowered woodlands with well-grown fruits and tubers, with herds of best animals and 
peaceful bird flocks... tranquil waters with spreading clusters of bloomed lotuses and water-birds in 
the pools and lakes... eye-pleasing rapids from mountains and you can see pleasant forests loaded with 
the hearty screams of precooks... [3-8-13, 14, 15]

Shlok 16: "My dear Rama, you may go and Soumitri you too also may go... but come again towards this hermitage 
after seeing all of them... [3-8-16]

Shlok 17: Thus said by the sage, Rama in his turn said to him, "so be it..." and having performed circumambulations 
around the sage he started to journey on. [3-8-17]

Shlok 18: Then the broad eyed Seetha gave auspicious quivers and bows to those brothers and then spotless swords 
too. [3-8-18]

Shlok 19: Both of those two Rama and Lakshmana tied their beautiful quivers well on their backs, and took the 
twangy bows and exited from that hermitage to go on their way. [3-8-19]

Shlok 20: Those two Raghava-s, the handsome princes, have swiftly set out when permitted by that august sage, 
wielding bows and swords, and along with Seetha. [3-8-20]



SARGA 9
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha foresees danger in Rama's decision to eliminate the demons in Dandaka forest, without 
			any provocation from their side, at the request of some sages. She narrates an old episode 
			about a sage who in possession of a weapon became violent and cruel.

[Text] 

Shlok 1: To Rama, the scion of Raghu and her husband, who started out when permitted by Sage Suteekshna, Vaidehi 
spoke this with friendly words. [3-9-1]

[Commentary] Seetha addresses Rama with this percept. "Wielding weaponry you are entering into an area where the 
demons are dense, and you intolerantly embark to kill them, thereupon we two get separated, which in 
turn is intolerable to you. So let us leave weapons back at hermitage and go to forests to see sages 
- Govindaraja. "The promise made to sages in eradicating demons is himsaatmaka, injurious; 
they can be won over by ahimsa, non-injurious methods also. None can avert Rama to make a promise, 
nor ask him to deviate from it. Aware of this stubbornness of Rama, her heart felt a foreboding, and 
that love-blind Seetha started telling in a friendlily manner, in view of her friendship with Rama, 
that may disrupt soon.

Shlok 2: "Gross unjust will accrue to any in an abstruse way if his indulgence is enkindled merely by his own 
desire, and in this world it is possible to fend them off, to have a recourse to justness... [3-9-2]

[Commentary] For the first word adharma of Gorakhpur version, there are other words available in other mms 
like yastu dharmam tu and ayam dharma . The critical editions and also Dharmaakuutam 
puts it as ayam dharmaH susuuksmeNa vidhinaa praapyate mahaan... Instead of adharma, ayam 
dharma is there, which changes the negative attitude to positive Then this ayam dharmaH 
translates as 'this dharma, the duty of a prince, which you are going to take-up in the wake of promise 
given to sages, i.e., killing demons, without a valid reason, that which is righteous to you, can be 
performed in a different way...'

Shlok 3- 4a: "Only three self-gratifications, the definite products of desire, are there: one is speaking fallacious 
utterances, which itself is worse, and worst than the other two malefic self-gratifications, where the 
other two are the fascination for other's wife, and the cruelness without enmity... [3-9-3, 4a]

[Commentary] Seetha is foretelling the triggering points in the course of Ramayana. The addictions or self-gratifying 
acts are defined as:



Hunting, sleeping in daytime, abusing others, indulgence in women, three artistic impulses namely music, 
dance and drama, wasteful wandering, are the ten desire. Manu smriti.

Shlok 4b- 5a: "The habit of telling specious words is not there with you in the past nor it will be there in future, 
oh, Raghava, then wherefrom the virtue-ruining desire for other's women can be there... [3-9-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: "Oh, king, earlier this vile desire for other's women is absent in you, nor it is there now, unobserved 
is such a desire in any corner of your heart oh, prince, for you are always interested in your own wife... 
[3-9-5, 6]

Shlok 7: "You are conscientious, adherent of truth, and obliging father's orders, and in you virtue and truth, 
nay everything is established in you... [3-9-7]

Shlok 8: "Oh, dextrous one, all this can possibly be shouldered by one with controlled senses, and oh, graceful 
one for a gaze, I am also aware of your sense control... [3-9-8]

[Commentary] The compound mahaabaahoshakyam is also cleaved as mahaa baaho a + shakyam, meaning 
that 'your attributes are impossible to be known even by the self-controlled sages, but they are known 
to me...' so says Seetha.

Shlok 9: "That third tendency to torture others' lives without enmity, that which will usually be effectuated 
unwarily, has now suddenly chanced before you... [3-9-9]

Shlok 10: "Intending to safeguard the sages you have promised the dwellers in Dandaka forest, oh, valiant one, 
that you would eliminate demons in a fight... [3-9-10]

Shlok 11: "Only in this respect you have started towards the well-known Dandaka forest along with your brother, 
and wielding bow and arrows...[3-9-11]

Shlok 12: "Then on seeing your starting my mind is apprehensively upset, on verily reflecting about your bearing 
there appears to be no beneficial good for you... [3-9-12]

[Commentary] This last compound of second foot where nisH shreyasam hitam is available in Gorakhpur version. 
In Eastern version it is bhaven niHshreyasam hi tat and in other older scripts it is:

Dharmaakuutam defines this expression as, anena bhartR^iu 
hitakaariNyaa bhaaryayaa shreyo bhavatiiti suucitam|| In any way, Seetha's contemplation is, 
"you abide by your oath given to sages, and thus kill the demons. But without a cause you do not proceed 
to eliminate. If a cause for quarrel is to be there, that will be due to me. If I become the cause and 
depart you, you cannot survive without me, for you are not a polygamist. So how all these factors like 
your promise, monogamy, and eliminating demons, can be resolved by you? Thus I am thinking along with 
the associated troubles which you are going to undergo..."

Shlok 13: "Oh, brave one, your going towards Dandaka forest is not delightful to me, I tell the cause for that 
and listen to it as I tell...[3-9-13]

Shlok 14: "Indeed on entering the forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows, seeing the forest 
ramblers there, won't you deplete arrows on all of them... [3-9-14]

Shlok 15: "The bow of warrior and the fuel of a burning fire if available within their reach, they immensely enhance 
their strength... [3-9-15]

Shlok 16: "Once upon a time, oh, dextrous one, there was a pious and true worded hermit in some merited forest 
that was wonted by animals and birds... [3-9-16]

Shlok 17: "Then Indra came to that hermitage handling a sword, and donning a soldier's guise, to cause hindrance 
to that hermit's ascesis... [3-9-17]

Shlok 18: "Indra gave that best sword to store, there in that hermitage to that sage who is lasting in his ascesis, 
on a redeemable basis... [3-9-18]

Shlok 9: "On receiving that sword, he who is duteous in guarding the entrustment, moved about in the forest always 
handling the sword, to safeguard the confidence reposed in him... [3-9-19]

Shlok 20: "Wherever that dedicated guardian of that entrustment goes, even to obtain tubers or fruits, he did 
not go without that sword... [3-9-20]

Shlok 21: "Carrying that sword always, that hermit slowly made his own faculty infuriated, loosing determination 
in ascesis... [3-9-21]

Shlok 22: "Then with the constant association of that weapon that sage gradually became inadvertent, and smitten 
by vice he went to hell... [3-9-22]

Shlok 23: "Thus, all this happened earlier, only owing the reason of associating with a weapon constantly, and 
the sequel of constant association with weapon is as good as constant association with fire... [3-9-23]

Shlok 24- 25: "In affinity and in respect I am reminding but not tutoring you, and in anyway improper is that thought 
of yours to wield your bow to kill the demons dwelling in Dandaka without any enmity, oh, brave one, 
undesirable is the killing of offenceless... [3-9-24, 25]

Shlok 26: "For the valiant Kshatriya-s who are inclined in forests heartily, the purpose of the bow is this much 
'safeguarding the sufferers...' [3-9-26]

[Commentary] There are some conflicting reviews on this stanza. It is said in the first foot vaneSu niyata aatmaanaam 
But older mms contain sva dharmeSu nirata aatmaanaam will be found, while Dharmaakuutam and 
Eastern versions have it as vaneSu nirata only. This Gorakhpur version and critical editions 
are having as vaneSu niyata The meaning in other versions is that Kshatriya-s should delight 
in their class-oriented righteousness, even when in forests. Thus Seetha's thinking is that they should 
live like hermits in forests, without resorting to the warring attributes of Kshatriya class. In the 
second foot she says that the function of bow is limited to 'safeguard the suffering lot...' In the 
next chapter at 3-10-3, Rama retorts with the same expression in answering Seetha.

Shlok 27: "Where that weapon? Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? And where is sageness? All 
this is inconsistent... let us esteem the laws of the land... [3-9-27]

Shlok 28: "Weapon admiring mind becomes maligned with avariciousness, you may therefore follow the tenet of Kshatriya-s 
on going to Ayodhya again... [3-9-28]

Shlok 29: "Everlasting satisfaction will be there to my father-in-law and mothers-in-laws, on your becoming a 
devout sage even after forfeiture of kingdom... [3-9-29]

Shlok 30: "From virtuousness prosperity emanates, from righteousness happiness, and by honourableness all are 
achieved, and this universe is the essence of probity... [3-9-30]

Shlok 31: "Experts will make efforts to exhaust their own selves with those and those principles, thus they realise 
sublimity... unachievable is pleasure by pleasuring alone... [3-9-31]

Shlok 32: "Always tread along the righteousness with a pure mind, oh, gentle one, and specially in these sagely 
forests... you know everything in all the three worlds, in all its nuances... [3-9-32]

Shlok 33: "I cite all this with my womanly waver, and who is capable to talk to you about dharma? Ponder mindfully 
along with your brother, and what that is appropriate, you do it...but not belatedly... [3-9-33]



This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, 
where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama's waging a war against demons. 
Seetha's doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number 
of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory 
in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying 'safeguard 
the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow..." as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning 
immediately at 3-9-27, 'where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit's way of living...' etc., dharmaakuutam 
says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without 
resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way.
ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad 
abhipraayakatvaat ||



She is inquisitive to know 
why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are 
having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven 
with their mortal bodies. Can't they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to 
heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. 
And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. 
Can't the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is 
the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the 
sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance.



Sage Vishvamitra, though 
being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered 
it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard 
their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests.



Secondly, Rama is subjected 
to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram 
should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit 
of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, 
Rama speaks to Vali -- "all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty 
to act in accordance with the decree of that throne..."



"Regarding the cause, Seetha's 
doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana.



SARGA 10
------------------------------

[Text] Rama replies Seetha's enquiry as to why he should wage war to eliminate the demons. He says 
			that it is only to protect the land from the atrocities of demons, and for safeguarding 
			the decrepit sages under his scheme of protecting the helpless.

Shlok 1: On hearing all of the words said by Vaidehi, in adoration of her husband, he who abides by virtue alone 
that Rama replied Janaki. [4-10-1]

Shlok 2: "You have said beneficial, friendlily words that are seemlier to your disposition, oh, lady, which 
are apt to speak of your familial brought up, for you are the daughter of virtue-knowing Janaka. [4-10-2]

Shlok 3: "What more shall I say, oh, lady, since it is said that 'a warrior handles a bow so that misery's tears 
cease to flow...' and this saying is iterated even by you... [4-10-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh! Seetha, those shleterable sages of Dandaka forest have approached me sombrely on their own, and 
thus they came into my refuge... [4-10-4]

Shlok 5: "Subsisting on fruits and tubers, living at all the time in forests those sages are not getting quietude, 
as they are scared by the demons with invidious deeds... [4-10-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: "The sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are being eaten away by fiendish demons that subsist on human 
flesh, and while being eaten away like that those eminent Brahmans have said to me, "please come to 
our rescue..." [4-10-6,7a]

Shlok 7b- 8- 9a: "This way when I have heard the words voiced by them, I comforted them verbally and avouched this way, 
"Be gracious to me... you all... by which reason I am being addressed this way by this kind of eminent 
Brahmans, whom I should have actually addressed my self, this indeed is a dishonour for me... [4-10-7b, 
8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Then I said before the Brahmans, "what shall I do?" All of them thus thronged and spoke this word. 
[4-10-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Many of the guise changing demons are outrightly torturing us in Dandaka forest, hence in that context 
you shall protect us... [4-10-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Those resistless carnivorous demons, oh, merited Rama, will descend exactly at the time of fire oblations, 
or on propitious times like full or new moons to persecute us... [4-10-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "We the ascetics being assaulted thus are aggrieved, and when we searched for a recourse you chanced 
as our ultimate course... [4-10-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "We by the efficacy of our ascesis are surely capable to eradicate those demons, but we do not wish 
to shorten the effect of our long earned merit of ascesis... [4-10-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Many hurdles are always there in our practice of ascesis, and even the ascesis have become impracticable, 
oh, Raghava, thus though being eaten away by the demons we are not issuing any curse... [4-10-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16b: "Thereby, you along with your brother protect us that are being persecuted by the demons dwelling in 
Dandaka forest as you alone are the protector of ours in these forests...'so said sages to me... [4-10-15b, 
16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "On hearing all those words, oh, Seetha, I promised complete protection to the sages of Dandaka forests... 
[4-10-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Having promised to the sages it is incapable of me to implement it otherwise while I am alive... truth 
is dearer to me, isn't it... [4-10-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "I may forfeit my life, forgo Lakshmana, or even forsake you but not a promise, that too especially 
made to Brahmans, and having promised I can never go back... [4-10-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "By that reason, oh, Seetha, even if I am unasked, safeguarding sages is definitely to be done by me, 
how then it is undone when given a promise... [4-10-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "With your friendship and good-heartedness you say these words, oh, Seetha, I am contended... uninterested 
ones do not forewarn, indeed... [4-10-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b: "Appropriate and seemly is your word of caution to your bloodline, oh, graceful Seetha, you are the 
co-pursuer in dharma with me, hence you are loftier to me than my own lives..." So said Rama to Seetha. 
[4-10-21b, c]

Shlok 22: That exalted soul Rama on saying those words to Seetha, his dear wife and the daughter of Janaka, wielding 
his bow proceeded further with Lakshmana to the picturesque woodlands of hermits. [4-10-22]



SARGA 11
------------------------------

[Text] Rama comes across lake from which divine music is heard. Surprised at the musical notes 
			from beneath the waters of the lake he enquires with the sage who is following, and that 
			sage narrates the episode of Sage Mandakarni. Then Rama proceeds on wondering at that lake, 
			and he visits all the hermitages about there and thus elapsed are ten years. Again Rama 
			returns to the hermitage of Sage Suteekhsna, and after staying there for some time, takes 
			leave of that sage and proceeds to see Sage Agastya. And on the way he visits the brother 
			of Sage Agastya also. Rama, on the way narrates about the great deeds done by Sage Agastya 
			in protecting humans from demons, and also depicts the propitious nature of Agastya's hermitage.

Shlok 1: Rama travelled ahead while the glorious Seetha in middle, and wielding bow Lakshmana followed them on 
the rear. [4-11-1]

[Commentary] This verse is commented specially by the ancient narrators. It is said that Om, praNava is 
reflected in this verse. The Om is the compound of three letters a + u + ma, and the first 
letter in the verse is a , in a + grataH. The second letter of Om, i.e.,
u is u in su sobhanaa. Other versions may read this as su madhyamaa 
, even then this u is there. The letter before last word ha is ma , as in
jagaa ma . These three letters put together are Om. So the three, Rama, Lakshmana, Seetha are 
compared with these three letters of Om.

[Commentary] Vishnu/Rama is in letter a and he is coursing ahead, agrartaH prayayau , followed by u, Lakshmi/Seetha, 
who is an embodiment of the Absolute's karuNa , benevolence, as said at lakshmyaa kaaruNya 
ruupayaa And she is the illusory aspect of that Absolute, Maya, yaamaa ye mï¿½ , and being 
so, she will be the veil in between that Absolute and Innate Soul. The last letter ma is
makaaro jiiva vaacaka, makaaro daasa vaacaka, is the sign for the servitude of the Innate Soul 
to the Absolute. That is what Lakshmana is.

[Commentary] And anu jagaama means that which follows without any I-ness or Mine-ness as a total surrender,
kainkarya . This agrataH prayayau raamaH is said to be the leadership quality of Soul, 
or Rama, where he does it himself without preaching, like Krishna. Previously when they entered forests, 
Lakshmana was leading and showing the way, as a dutiful servant. During next phase all three walked 
in line. Now, Rama wanted to wage war with demons, thus he leads the way, keeping Seetha in centre, 
followed and guarded by Lakshmana. This is the view point of the sages following them, for they the 
sages always meditate about that Absolute, in terms of Om, and these three appeared as the 
three letters of Om.

Shlok 2: They proceeded while seeing diverse mountain terraces, forests, and diversely enchanting rivers too, 
along with Seetha. [4-11-2]

Shlok 3: Beholding the rivers that have water-birds like saarasa, chakravaaka that move on their sandbanks, and 
also the lakes that contain lotuses and water born birds, they moved on. [4-11-3]

Shlok 4: The moved on watching spotted deer banded in herds, the wild boars, large horned buffaloes maddened 
in virility, and the ruttish elephants rending trees like their enemies. [4-11-4]

Shlok 5: On going far on their way, and when the sun is dangling in the western skiy, together they saw a charming 
lake of one yojana width fully overloaded with red and white lotuses, overspread with sporting elephants, 
and over-flurried with waterfowls like saarasa birds, kaadamba birds, swans and with others kinds too. 
[4-11-5, 6]

Shlok 7: Out of the tranquil and enchanting waters of that lake audible are the melodies of singing and musical 
instruments, but none is visible. [4-11-7]

Shlok 8: Then Rama and also Lakshmana, the great charioteer, inquisitively started to ask the Sage named Dharmabhrita 
about it. [4-11-8]

Shlok 9: "On hearing this greatly amazing music from lake, oh, great saint, intensive inquisitiveness is created 
in all of us, why this, please tell us clearly about it." Thus Rama asked. [4-11-9]

Shlok 10: Thus said by that Raghava then that virtuous sage quickly started to tell about the efficacy of that 
lake. [4-11-10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, Rama, this is an all-time lake built by the ascetic power of the sage Mandakarni, known as Five 
Apsara Lake. [4-11-11]

Shlok 12: "He that great saint Mandakarni practiced rigorous ascesis for ten thousand years staying in the waters 
of the lake, and consuming air alone. [4-11-12]

Shlok 13: "Then all the gods are worried and met together with Fire-god at the helm of affairs, and they all conversed 
among themselves. [4-11-13]

Shlok 14: "This sage is praying for someone's place among us," thus all of those heaven-dwellers are perturbed 
at heart. [4-11-14]

Shlok 15: "Then all gods assigned five important Apsara-s, the celestial courtesans, whose shine is like the sprint 
of the lightning, to effectuate hindrance in that sage's ascesis. [4-11-15]

Shlok 16: Then those five celestial beauties have led that sage astray who discerned the nature of this and the 
other world, or good and bad, or the nature of Absolute-Soul and Body- bound Soul, towards the passional 
restraint by, as though to achieve god's task.

Shlok 17: "Also thus, those five celestial apsara-s attained wifehood of that sage, and for them he built a house 
in there, concealed inside that lake. [4-11-17]

Shlok 18: "While those five celestial apsara-s are living in there, they are gratifying that sage according to 
his delight as youthfulness came upon that sage owing to his power of asceticism. [4-11-18]

Shlok 19: "These musical sounds we hear are emerging out as played on their instruments, mingled with the tinkling 
of their ornaments, and mixed with their delightful singing of melodies." So said sage Dharmabhrita 
to Rama. [4-11-19]

Shlok 20: That highly renowned Raghava together with his brother acknowledged the sage Dharmabhrita's account, 
exclaiming it as "amazing is this..." [4-11-20]

Shlok 21- 22a: While saying thus Raghava has seen a cluster of hermitages nearby, encircled with sacred grass, jute 
cloths, and even encompassed with Vedic solemness, and he entered that hermitage along with Seetha and 
Lakshmana. [4-11-21, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23- 24a: Rama happily stayed in that august cluster of hermitages duly venerated by those great saints for sometime, 
and then that expert in great missiles Rama went to the hermitages of those sages with whom he stayed 
earlier, for another round. [4-11-22, 23, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25- 26a: Rama stayed there for nearly ten months at some place, elsewhere for one year, at somewhere else for 
four months, and for five, and six months at elsewhere, even at somewhere else for more than a month, 
and for more than one and half months elsewhere. [4-11-24, 25, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: While Raghava stayed comfortably taking delight in those hermitages of sages, indeed ten years have 
smoothly elapsed. [4-11-26b, 27a]

[Commentary] As per the above the counof monthst comes to sixty months, i.e., five years. But it is said that ten 
years are elapsed comfortably. There are a good number of arguments counting the months said above and 
the point of ten years, said finally. Dharmaakuutam puts it as ten years only: tataH paryaayeNa 
nikhila muni jana nilayeShu niitvaa dasha samvatsaraan punaraagamya tiikShNatapasaH sutiikShNam|| 
Thus ten full years are spent only in around these hermitages, peregrinating from one to the other. 
The total period of exile is fourteen years. Here it is said that ten years are completed. In Chitrakuta 
two years are spent. Then the search for Seetha and final war should happen in two year span.

Shlok 27b- 28a: Thus that virtue-knowing glorious Rama on going around those hermitages along with Seetha indeed went 
to the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna again. [4-11-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: On coming at that hermitage that enemy destroyer is adored by sages, and he resided there for some time. 
[4-11-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Then on one day while staying in that hermitage Rama submissively said this to that sage Suteekshna 
who is sitting nearby. [4-11-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: "I have always heard through the narratives narrated by other sages that the godly and eminent sage 
Agastya is residing in this forest. [4-11-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: "But due to the vastness of this forest I have not known that place, where is the pious hermitage of 
that astute sage? [4-11-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: "I wish to approach that sage seeking that godly sage's graciousness, along with my brother and Seetha 
to venerate him. [4-11-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: "Can I personally propitiate that supreme sage -- is my high ambition, and it is recurrent in my heart." 
So said Rama to Suteekshna. [4-11-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: Sage Suteekshna on hearing that particular request of that virtue-minded Rama is gladdened and said 
this to him. [4-11-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b- 36b: "Oh, Raghava, even I wished to say this to you, that you may approach Agastya along with Lakshmana and 
Seetha. [4-1-35b, 36a]

Shlok 36b- 37a: "But providentially you alone raised this topic with me, Rama, I will tell you where that great sage 
Agastya is. [4-11-36b, 37a]

Shlok 37b: "On your going four yojana-s from this hermitage, oh, dear Rama, there is the great and glorious hermitage 
of Agastya's brother on the southern side. [4-11-37b, c]

Shlok 38: "That hermitage is there on a plateau in a spectacular place of that forest which is adorned with many 
flowers and fruits, thickets of long pepper, and reechoed with the callings of various birds. [4-11-38]

Shlok 39- 40a: "There are diverse lakes that are receptacles for tranquil waters, that are teeming with swans and partridges, 
beautified with ruddy geese, and Rama staying there for a night you may proceed in the next morning. 
[4-11-39, 40a]

Shlok 40b- 41a: "On going one yojana beyond, taking the southward course on the side of the forest clump you will find 
Agastya's hermitage. [4-11-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b- 42: "Seetha and Lakshmana will enjoy those woodlands adorned with diverse pleasant trees, as the woodlands 
abounding with diverse trees will naturally be delightful, isn't it. [4-11-41b, 42]

Shlok 43: "If your mind is made up to see that great sage Agastya, oh, great ingenious Rama, resolve your thinking 
in going only today." So said Sage Suteekshna to Rama. [4-11-43]

Shlok 44: On listening that which is said by the sage, Rama revered that sage along with his brother, and then 
he journeyed with Seetha and his follower Lakshmana aiming to reach Agastya. [4-11-44]

Shlok 45- 46: While viewing beautiful forests, cloud-like mountains, lakes, and rivers that are flowing following 
the pathways, Rama happily journeyed on the pathway indicated by sage Suteekshna, then he gladly spoke 
this sentence to Lakshmana. [4-11-45, 46]

Shlok 47: "Definitely this alone appears to be the hermitage of Sage Agastya's brother, one with great soul and 
pious deeds. [4-11-47]

Shlok 48: "As how thousands of trees are bowing under the weight of flowers and fruit on the pathway, thereby 
I perceive it to be the hermitage of Agastya's bother. [4-11-48]

Shlok 49: "Upraised by the wind the sour-smell of pippali fruits is suddenly coming closer from the forest. [4-11-49]

Shlok 50: "Here and there visible are the well heaped heaps of firewood, and all over appearing is the sacred 
grass snipped at its top and gemlike in its tinge. [4-11-50]

Shlok 51: "From inside the hermitage in the midst of this forest the vertex of smoke from ritual fire is clearly 
visible as high as the vertex of a black rainy cloud. [4-11-51]

Shlok 52: "On performing bathing in sacred streams the Brahmans are making flower offerings to gods, called
puSpa bali, with the flowers that are personally collected by them. [4-11-52]

[Commentary] If flowers for worship are taken from someone else, half of the merit of that worship goes to the one 
who gave those flowers. Hence the flowers are to be plucked by the worshipper alone, that too from his 
flower garden. They are not to be stolen, begged, carried in palms, or in upper cloth, but to be carried 
in a big size leaf.

[Commentary] "Best are the flowers brought personally, medium is the forest-born, purchased are the worse, and those 
that are brought by others, the worst."

Shlok 53: "Thus by the words of Sage Suteekshna as I have heard, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this hermitage shall definitely 
be that of Sage Agastya's brother. [4-11-53]

Shlok 54: "Whose brother is Sage Agastya with meritorious deeds, who wishing well-being of the world controlled 
death by his efficacy, and who made this southern region a liveable region, this must be the hermitage 
of such a sage, such Agatya's brother. [4-11-54]

Shlok 55: "Once upon a time verily cruel demon brothers Vaataapi and Ilvala were here together, and they the dreadful 
demons, they say, used to be Bhraman-killers. [4-11-55]

Shlok 56: "Disguising in Bhraman's semblance and speaking sophisticatedly that Ilvala used to invite Brahmans 
for the purpose of obsequial ceremonies, where Brahman are fed after usual ceremony to appeases their 
manes. [4-11-56]

[Commentary] Here the word sam skR^ita is another point for discussion for commentators saying that the 
demon Ilvala used to speak in chaste Sanskrit. This is one version. The other is as above speaking sophisticatedly. 
But as could be seen all the raakshasa-s are Vedic pundits and thus there is no oddity in their speaking 
chaste Sanskrit. Hence their luring or sophisticated talk to entice Brahmans is taken valid. The following 
verse also has the same word, meaning refinement.

Shlok 57: Then Ilvala used to make his brother Vaataapi into a ram, perfect that ram's meat into deliciously cooked 
food, and used to feed Brahmans according to obsequial rites and deeds. [4-11-57]

Shlok 58: "When those Brahmans are surfeited with that ram's meat, then Ilvala used to shout loudly, "oh, Vaataapi, 
you may come out." [4-11-58]

Shlok 59: "Then on listening his brother's words Vaataapi used to lunge out bleating like a ram, tearing and rending 
the bodies of those Brahmans. [4-11-59]

Shlok 60: "This way they the guise changing demons always ruined thousands of Brahmans together, greedy for raw-flesh 
as they are. [4-11-60]

[Commentary] Some say that the wording taiH they, is plural ad it is not accommodative, and some ancient 
text of unknown reference contained these words, taabhyaam evam paramtapa pishita ashayaa by 
them two, that way, Lakshmana, for pishita aashayaa raw meat, avaricious as they are, they 
used to kill.

Shlok 61: "Then by Sage Agastya, whom gods have prayed to end this demonic menace, and whom demon Ilvala invited 
to feast during obsequial rites, he that Agastya having relished the fiendish demon in the form of ram, 
they say, had finished him off. [4-11-61]

Shlok 62: "Then Ilvala while giving lateral hand wash into the palms of Agastya entered in the routine conversation 
of obsequies asking, "Is this rite fulfilled..." and he furthered it in calling his brother to come 
out. [4-11-62]

Shlok 63: Then that wise and eminent sage Agastya spoke mockingly to Ilvala who is conversing that way to his 
brother to come out. [4-11-63]

Shlok 64: "Where is the energy for that ram shaped demon brother of yours to come out as I digested and sent him 
to the hellish residence of Terminator. [4-11-64]

[Commentary] This saying of Agastya has remained as an epigram till date. That demon Ilvala called out, "Vaataapi..." 
for which Agastya replied jiirNam 'digested...' and after repeating this exchange for some 
time, these questions and answers are combined to form this sentence: jiirNam jiirNam vaataapi jiirNam 
meaning that 'Vaataapi is digested...' In traditional upbringing, mothers used to say after feeding 
babies with milk or other nourishments, giving a mild exercise, jiirNam jiirNam Vaataapi jiirNam 
for many times. It means that mothers wished their babies should digest any indigestible or food ruinous 
to health, as has been digested by Sage Agastya. It is said Agastya prohibited any kind of meat to Brahmans, 
as meat food will be shearing their stomachs with it ram's horns from then on. He is also said to have 
cursed Brahmans to be diverse, braahmaNaanaam anekatvam as none will concur with the other.

Shlok 65: "Then on hearing the words of sage Agastya affirming brother's demise, that night-walking demon furiously 
commenced to assault the sage. [4-11-65]

Shlok 66: "When that demon rushed towards that best Bhraman to kill, he that sage glowing with his own refulgence 
burnt him down just by his flame-like eyes and doomed him to death. [4-11-66]

Shlok 67: "This hermitage embellishing with lake and woods belongs to the brother of Sage Agastya who has done 
this impossible deed just by his compassion towards Brahmans." So said Rama to Lakshmana and Seetha 
about Agastya. [4-11-67]

Shlok 68: While Rama narrated that way to Lakshmana sun went into dusk and the vesperal time came close of him. 
[4-11-68]

Shlok 69: Worshipping sunset along with brother as per custom, Rama entered that hermitage and greeted that sage. 
[4-11-69]

Shlok 70: Raghava spent one night there when that sage received him well and when they dined on tubers and fruits. 
[4-11-70]

Shlok 71: Raghava spent that night there and when sun rose in solar orbit he took leave of the brother of Sage 
Agastya saying the following. [4-11-71]

Shlok 72: "Oh, godly sage, we stayed in the night comfortably, I now make an obeisance and bid farewell to you, 
as I wish to proceed to see your mentor and elder brother Agastya. [4-11-72]

Shlok 73: When the brother of Agastya said, "you may go," Rama the legatee of Raghu journeyed on the pathways 
as directed by Suteekshna, and on observing those woodlands. [4-11-73]

[Commentary] The name of this brother of Agastya is Sudarshana. But none calls him by that name and he is just called
agastya bhraata , Agastya's brother.

Shlok 74: On observing the wild grass that grows on its own giving wild grain, Jack-fruit trees, sala trees, Ashoka 
trees, lemons trees, saplings of bilva trees and also madhuka and bilva trees he journeyed. [4-11-74]

Shlok 75- 76: Rama has seen hundreds of flowered forest trees that are battered by the trunks of elephants, that are 
adorned with monkeys, reverberated by hundreds of lusty bird folks, and that are enriched by the flowered 
climbers whorled around them. [4-11-75, 76]

Shlok 77: Then the lotus-eyed Rama said this to his follower Lakshmana who is a valiant and glory-enriching one 
and who is near at hand. [4-11-77]

Shlok 78: "As to how the trees are appearing with velvety leaves, and as to how the animals and birds appear unwearied, 
thus gauging by this it appears that the hermitage of that contemplative soul Agastya is situated not 
very far from here. [4-11-78]

Shlok 79: "He who by his own deed is renowned in the world as Agastya, the stopper of mountain, it appears to 
be his hermitage that alleviates the weary of wearied ones. [4-11-79]

[Commentary] The name Agastya is cleavable like aga+ stha mountain, who stayed, stopped from excessive growth.

Shlok 80: "The forest nearby this hermitage is overrun by huge smoke from altars of fire, overstuffed with the 
garlands of jute cloth, overcrowded with the herds of peaceful deer, and also overloaded with sonority 
of the birds. [4-11-80]

Shlok 81: "He who impeding death by his yogic might and wishing well-being for worlds made this southern extent 
a liveable province by his pious deeds, his hermitage is this. [4-11-81]

[Commentary] There is some problem in copying. These stanzas of verse have already appeared above at 4-11-54.

Shlok 82: "Under whose influence the demons behold this southern quarter appallingly, and they do not even venture 
to live here, such a sage Agastya's hermitage is this. [4-11-82]

Shlok 83: "And from when that pious deeded Agastya took possession of this quarter, from then on the night walkers 
are calmed down and remained without feud. [4-11-83]

Shlok 84: "This very worthy southern quarter is known in the name of that godly saint Agastya and this remained 
unattackable to the demons with cruel deeds. [4-11-84]

Shlok 85: "Complying which sage's directive Mt. Vindhya ceased to heighten in order not to obstruct the path of 
the sun, such sage's hermitage is this who is renowned in the world by his deeds and whose longevity 
is inestimable, hence this glorious hermitage is adored by well-behaved animals and humans as well. 
[4-11-85, 86]

[Commentary] The name Agastya is derived from a famous act of this Sage. Mt. Meru is the highest peak on earth. By 
its nature it grows day by day, and stands first to be saluted by the rising sun in east every day. 
Jealous of this Mt. Meru, Mt. Vindhya started to rise to exceed the height of Mt. Meru, thus obstructing 
the sun's path. Then the day changed for night and the travel of Sun and Moon, the performance of Vedic 
rituals, which are bound by the solar lunar movement, went topsy-turvy. Then the gods prayed Agastya 
to do something to decrease the height of Mt. Meru. Agastya and his wife then were coming to Mt. Vindhya 
and seeing its height, he requested Mt. Vindhya, "Oh, Mountain King Vindhya, myself and my wife are 
going southward, and we are not able to climb this much height... kindly lower yourself, so that we 
old people climb you and go to the other side..." Mt. Vindhya being an ardent worshipper of sages and 
saints immediately lowered his height to the ground level, so that the old couple need not climb but 
just walk over him. Agastya and his wife on coming to the southern side of the mountain again requested 
Mt. Vindhya to be at this height only, for they will be returning soon to north. Mt. Vindhya readily 
agreed for that also, and it is lying like that even today. Because Agastya did not return to north 
on coming to south Mt. Vindhya is still believed to be at ground level. Thus the solar and lunar movement, 
seasons' revolve, Vedic calendars etc. are again put to normalcy. Thus the name Agastya, aga stha 
mountain, stopper, agam sthaasyati or, stabhnaati iti agastyaH. He played an important 
role in uplifting southern regions of India, namely Dravidian cultures. Hid wife is Lopaamudra, the 
saintly lady will be quoted in Lalitha Sahasra Naamaavali. The thousand name of Mother Universe.

Shlok 87: "He that gentle sage who is always interested in the respect of sagacious ones is thus an esteemed one 
in the world, and for us when we approach him he accords beneficence. [4-11-87]

Shlok 88: "Oh, adept Lakshmana, I wish to worship that great saint Agastya therein that hermitage, and oh, gentle 
one, I think of living the remainder of forest living here only. [4-11-88]

Shlok 89: "There gods with gandharva-s, siddha-s, exalted sages will be worshipping Agastya who is self-regulating 
self-disciplinary. [4-11-89]

Shlok 90: "There no liar can live, nor a savage, nor even a deceiver, nor a man-torturer, nor one with sinful 
behaviour, for that sage is of that nature. [4-11-90]

Shlok 91: "There the gods, celestials, reptiles, birds live together wishing to worship the Absolute with self-discipline. 
[4-11-91]

Shlok 92: "There the blest and great souls of accomplished ascesis rode to heavens by aircrafts similar to sun 
in resplendence, on relinquishing their mortal bodies here and on obtaining new bodies. [4-11-92]

Shlok 93: "There gods will endow the state of celestials or immortals, or many realms of divine living to those 
auspicious beings that worship them. [4-11-93]

Shlok 94: "We arrived at the threshold of the hermitage, oh, Soumitri, you enter firstly and submit to Sage Agastya 
about my arrival at this place along with Seetha. [4-11-94]

[Commentary] This is an important point of Rama's speaking to Lakshmana for a protocol to enter the hermitage. Earlier 
all the three used to enter together, releasing bowstrings and in all their submissiveness. But here 
Rama wants to follow an imperial protocol to announce his arrival there. Rama is said to have asked 
Lakshmana to inform the sage that karta subject to eliminate -  himself; and the object, or 
the instrument to eliminate Ravana, namely Seetha have come. Rama says in above verses that he would 
like to spend rest of the exile here in this hermitage. But Sage Agastya later asks him to proceed to 
Panchavati, i.e., towards the dominions of demons. For that and for keeping the sage informed about 
the arrival of time to eradicate Ravana, Rama seeks this protocol.



SARGA 12
------------------------------

[Text] Rama, Lakshmana, and Seetha enter the hermitage of Sage Agastya. Sage Agastya is also waiting 
			to receive Rama for along time, and now receives them with all honours, sagaciously perceiving 
			Rama as Vishnu incarnate. Sage Agastya gives a divine bow of Vishnu, two quivers with ever 
			replenishing with arrows, and a golden sword in a golden sheath to Rama, saying that with 
			the very same armoury Vishnu once eradicated evil on earth.

Shlok 1: On entering the hermitage Lakshmana, the younger brother of Raghava, reached Agastya's disciple and 
spoke this sentence to him. [3-12-1]

Shlok 2: "A king named Dasharatha was there, his eldest son and the dynamic one, Rama has arrived along with 
his wife Seetha to see the sage. [3-12-2]

Shlok 3: "I am his loyal, dedicated, and adherent younger brother named Lakshmana, if ever you have heard of 
us. [3-12-3]

Shlok 4: "Such as we are, we entered the awful forest at the decree of our father, and we wiush to see the godly 
sage, let this be informed to him." Said Lakshmana to the disciple of Agastya. [3-12-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing that sentence of Lakshmana that disciple who is ascetically rich replied 'agreed, ' and he 
entered the sanctum of Ritual-fire to submit the same to Agastya. [3-12-5]

[Commentary] This sanctum where the Altar of Fire is established will be well deep inside these hermitages. One arrives 
at the Altar of Fire after passing through many places designated to particular deities, where fire 
oblations are conducted. These places of worship occurring before the hall of homa are listed in the 
coming verses.

Shlok 6- 7a: He that agreeable disciple of sage quickly approached the irrefutable sage by his asceticism, made palm-fold 
and said this to the eminent sage about about the arrival of Rama, exactly as said by Lakshmana. [3-12-6, 
7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "Sons of King Dasharatha, Rama and also thus Lakshmana have entered the threshold of hermitage along 
with the wife of Rama, namely Seetha. [3-12-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Those two enemy-destroyers have come cherishing to see and serve you, hence it will be apt of you to 
order what next is to be done in this regard." Said disciple to the sage. [3-12-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Having heard from the disciple that Rama has arrived with Lakshmana and with highly fortunate Seetha 
the sage said this to him. [3-12-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "My heart is indeed yearning for his arrival, and after this long a time Rama providentially came to 
see me." [3-12-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Go forth and make welcome to Rama, Lakshmana and to Seetha, and they be entered here, why you have 
not invited them as yet? [3-12-11b, 12a]

[Commentary] Agastya is waiting for long to receive Rama to handover a great bow, quivers and sword. Agastya himself 
an eliminator of demons and Rama's mission is also the same. Therefore, on hearing that "Rama arrived 
" his ears are said to have received an ear-pleasing experience, karNa aananda anubhava. Maheshvara 
Tirtha.

Shlok 12b- 13a: Thus said by the great-souled sage and the knower of virtue, the disciple adored him with palm-fold 
saying that "as you say." [3-12-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Then that disciple went out with a little perplexity and said this to Lakshmana, "Where is this Rama? 
He may come to see the sage and let him enter hermitage on his own." Said that disciple to Lakshmana. 
[3-12-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Then on going out to the exterior of that hermitage along with that disciple, Lakshmana has shown him 
Rama and Janaka's daughter Seetha. [3-12-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: While that disciple repeated the obliging words of Agastya entered that reception-worthy Rama into hermitage 
on receiving him well. [3-12-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: And then Rama entered the hermitage with Seetha and Lakshmana looking over it which is overspread with 
docile deer. [ 3-12-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19- 20- 21a: Rama entered inside the hermitage and saw therein the sanctus of Brahma, Fire-god, Vishnu, Indra, Vivasvat 
- the Sun-god, Soma - the Moon-god, Bhaga - one among the twelve Suns, and the sanctusms of Kubera, 
[Wealth-Management-god, are seen and passed by the three of them, sanctums of Dhaata, Vidhaata - Vedic 
deities created by Brahma to help Svayambhuu Manu, santucm of Vaayu - the Air-god, and also like that 
the sanctum of great-soloed VaruNa - the Rain-god who also wields noose, and the sanctum of Gayatri 
- the presiding deity of gnosis, sanctum of Vasus - eight of them, and the sanctum of cobra's king - 
aadi sheSa, the divine Thousand-headed serpent that bears this globe on its head, and on which Vishnu 
reclines, and even the sanctum of GaruDa - the Divine Eagle and the vehicle of Vishnu, and the half 
brother of aadi sheSa, and the sanctum of Kaartikeya - chief of gods army, second son of Shiva, and 
the sanctum of Dharma - Dharmaraaja, presiding deity of Virtue-Vice-Time of living beings, in-charge 
of the hell. [17b, 18, 19, 20, 21a]

[Commentary] These sanctums are particular holy places in hermitages where those designated deities will be invoked 
for worship. These will be seventeen in general, as said in Vedic doctrine, yo vai sapta dasha 
- Defined by seventeen letters. On passing through all these places, the place of homa kunDa 
, Altar of Fire will come. Hence, usually none will be allowed inside the hermitages, and all are supposed 
to stay in aashrama padam , the hermitage's threshold, a porch or portico minus its roofing. 
As such Rama wanted an entry in to hermitage.

Shlok 21b- 22a: Then encircled by disciples the sage Agastya came out quickly, and Rama saw him who is glowing brilliant 
before all the other sages. [3-12-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] In the list of sanctums said above no place is said for Shiva, on which earlier commentators discussed 
much. Of them Govindaraja stated, "Shiva has no worshipfulness in Vaishnavaite way, hence his sanctum 
is unsaid: atra puujya 
daivateShu rudrasya anupaadaanaat a-puujyatvam uktam | adhunaa kaiscit puujya maanataa tu taamasa shaastra 
anurodhaneti bodhyam|| Others contradicted this, saying that when Shiva's son, Kaartikeya 
is adorable, why not his Father? Rama Tilaka states agniratra rudraH The naming of Agni, Fire-god, 
as in 17th verse itself is Rudra, namely Shiva. ShiromaNi commentary also puts in the same way ' 
tatra agni shabdena shambhuH ucyate By the nomenclature of Fire, Shiva is to be construed.

Shlok 22b- 23: On seeing the brilliantly glowing sage among those sages, he that bold Rama said this sentence to Lakshmana, 
the fortifier of fortune, "Here comes the godly sage, Lakshmana, by his eminence I comprehend him as 
a depository of all ascesis." [3-12-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: That dexterous Rama on saying about that sun-like radiant sage Agastya, he that descendent of Raghu 
fell on the feet of Agastya touching them reverentially. [3-12-24]

Shlok 25: Then he who is a delight to the on lookers that noble-hearted Rama on revering the sage along with Lakshmana 
and Seetha, the princess from Videha, stood aside with his palms adjoined. [3-12-25]

Shlok 26: Offering seat and water that sage received Rama, and even on exchanging pleasantries that sage said 
to him, "please be seated." [3-12-26]

Shlok 27: Having completed his personal worship to Fire-god, and having offered water and other formalities to 
guest, that sage gave viands to guests according to his hermitic observances. [3-12-27]

[Commentary] The hermit's observances include the ritual to Fire-god before food. In some case one has to personally 
light the fire, cook his own food to the chanting of hymns, like Agastya which is an observances called
viashva devam Even now these are observed by some Vedic Brahmans.

Shlok 28: Then that eminent and shrewd sage Agastya in righteousness took his seat at the outset, and spoke to 
prudent Rama of righteousness itself, and who by now is sitting with his palms adjoined. [3-12-28]

Shlok 29: "Worshipping the fire, giving water and worshipping the guest a hermit should receive a guest and feed 
him, and if a hermit practices contrarily, oh, Rama, he is destined to eat his own flesh like a false 
deponent in other world say, hell. [3-12-29]

[Commentary] A guest is one who enables the host to go to heavens.
iShTo 
vaa yadi vaa dveShyo muurkhaH paNDita eva vaa | sampraapte vaishvadeva ante so atithi svarga sa~NkramaH 
|| "May he be dear one or despised, stupid or scholar, one who comes at the end of 
fire worship before meals, he leads the host to heavens" - paraashara suutra. Any false deponent 
giving a false witness not only goes to hell but also is destined to eat his own flesh there. Same is 
the case with the host, who does not perform his daily chores to entertain his guest.

Shlok 30: "You are the king of all the world, the treader in the path of righteousness, great charioteer of probity, 
and you are the venerable and estimable one, and you have arrived as my dear guest. [3-12-30]

[Commentary] The other way of rendering is: raajaa sarvasya lokasya ruler, of all, three worlds, hence you 
are Vishnu; mahaa rathaH great, charioteer of mortal souls through karmic cycles, thus Narayana;
puujaniiya venerable one even in daily worship, hence Vishnu; maanyaH credible one 
by those who aspire salvation, Narayana; priya atithi much desired guest than the routine sage/mortal 
guests, hence god. Thus, it is said that Sage Agastya realised Rama as Vishnu and eulogised Rama incarnation. 
Even the daily puuja worship is conducted in a manner of treating the deity as a symbolic guest 
in the household. Here that deity himself is the real guest, i.e., Narayana.

Shlok 31: Saying thus, Agastya adored Raghava well with fruits, tubers, flowers and others according to his ardency, 
and then he said this to Rama. [3-12-31]

Shlok 32- 33a: "This sacred bow that is decorated with gold and diamonds is crafted by the divine architect Vishvakarma 
pertains to Vishnu, and these unwasteful arrows equalling sun in their blaze are the gift of Brahma. 
[3-12-32, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34: "Also these two inexhaustible quivers packed with arrows that have the blaze of Ritual-fire, and this 
sword decorated in gold together with its sheath made up of excellent golden are once given to me by 
Indra. [3-12-33b, 34]

Shlok 35: "By this bow, oh, Rama, once Vishnu eliminated horrible demons in war and brought back radiant prosperity 
to the celestials. [3-12-35]

Shlok 36: "The bow, these two quivers, arrows, and the sword, oh, Rama, the endower of grace, receive and wield 
them to triumph over the demons as Indra would wield Thunderbolt. [3-12-36]

Shlok 37: On saying thus that great resplendent and godly sage Agastya, gave all of those best weapons to Rama, 
and again spoke to Rama [3-12-37]



SARGA 13
------------------------------

[Text] Rama requests Sage Agastya to indicate a place in the forest to make a residence
during the days of exile. Sage Agastya foresees the next course of Ramayana, and orients his
conversation around womanhood and Seetha. Then that sage informs Rama to proceed to Panchavati
where Seetha will be delightful of its surroundings.

Shlok 1: " I am delighted Rama, safe you be, oh Lakshmana, well-contended I am for you have
come to pay respects to me along with Seetha. [3-13-1]

Shlok 2: "The well-worn trail of yours on pathway is strenuousness and painful for you two,
and it is evident from the sweat above your necks, even much more for Janaka's daughter, Maithili.
[3-13-2]

[Commentary] The word utkaNTha is interpreted in two ways. One is ut kaNTha
above neck, sides of face; the other being the anxiousness to get some rest. Thus, they are either
wet with sweat or also anxious to get rest after a long trek in woods.

Shlok 3: "She is delicate and not discomforted by such distresses earlier, yet motivated by
her friendship she came to these highly detrimental forests. [3-13-3]

Shlok 4: "In which way Seetha takes delight in these forests, Rama, that you may ensure
to her, for she has done an impossible deed in following you to forests, an impossible deed for
womenfolk, in general. [3-13-4]

Shlok 5: "From the beginning of creation the nature of women is this way only, oh scion of
Raghu, they devote themselves to their men in good fortune, but they leave them off in ill fortune.
[3-13-5]

Shlok 6: "With the mercuriality of hundreds of streaks of thunderbolt and with the
incisiveness of a weapon, and with the speediness of an eagle or the gusty wind, the women are
conformable. [3-13-6]

[Commentary] The flashes of thunderbolts are famous for their mercuriality and so
capricious are the women's hearts with the speed of lightning, and razor sharp will be their
attitude to cut-off the age-old friendship, if they are ill at ease, and they sever relations with
the speediness of an eagle or a gust.

Shlok 7: "But she this wife of yours is devoid of all those stigmas, an exemplary and an
estimable lady, like Lady Arundhati. [3-13-7]

[Commentary] Lady Arundhati is the wife of Sage Vashishta, an exemplary lady in devotion to
her husband and she has become a star in the sky by virtue of that devotion. Even today in
marriages, at the close of all observances, this star in skies is shown to the bride imbuing a
sense of devotion to her bridegroom, may it be in noontime.

Shlok 8: "Where you wish to put up along with Lakshmana and with this Seetha, oh,
enemy-destroyer Rama, that province shall be glorified." So said Sage Agastya to Rama."
[3-13-8]

Shlok 9: Thus said by the sage, Raghava spoke amiable this sentence adjoining his palms to
the sage who is glowing like a ritual-fire. [3-13-9]

Shlok 10: "I am privileged and blessed as my mentor and the eminent age is well pleased with
the virtues of my brother and wife which are non-dissimilar to mine. [3-13-10]

Shlok 11: "But a place with water and many forests may please be shown, where I can reside
happily and self-composedly on erecting a hermitage." Thus Rama asked the Sage Agastya.
[3-13-11]

Shlok 12: Then that eminent sage Agastya on contemplating a while about what Rama has said,
that virtuous and confident sage spoke more ideational word to Rama. [3-13-12]

[Commentary] Rama wanted a place with 'many forests,' which is non-conditional to his exile.
Some versions contain after dharma aatmaa , and said tato vaacha vacaH subham.
This will not appear in critical or eastern recessions. For this diiraH dhiira taram vacaH
, is there. It is said, that sage Agastya contemplated for a while, and envisioning the future of
Seetha's abduction and Rama's elimination of Ravana etc by his yogic power, he said to Rama to stay
at Panchavati. This is because, he himself is courageous sage in eliminating the demons, trusting
that Rama also will do the same, he has shown a place which has many forests' around it, that too
as Rama desired.

Shlok 13: "A most prosperous place called Panchavati is there at a distance of two yojana-s
from here, oh, dear Rama, which is abundant with tubers, fruits, water, and many deer." Thus
Agastya started to tell. [3-13-13]

Shlok 14: "On your going there along with Saumitri, and on erecting a hermitage you may
take delight in there complying the decreed order of your father. [3-13-14]

Shlok 15: "Indeed all of this episode of yours is known to me, oh, merited one, by the
ability of my asceticism, and also by my friendship with Dasharatha. [3-13-15]

Shlok 16- 17a: "I am in the know of your heartfelt certitude by my ascesis, thereby I wish to
advise you to go to Panchavati, though I said that you may dwell in these ascetic-woods along with
me. [3-13-16, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "That woodland will be delightful, isn't it Raghava, for it is praiseworthy and not
very far off from here, and Seetha can take delight in there. [3-13-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: "There Maithili will take delight nearby River Godavari, and it is with abundant
tubers, fruits, various are its bird flocks, and it is very reclusive too, oh, great dextrous Rama,
further it is meritorious and appealing. [3-13-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: "Even you, Rama, with your good deportment are capable to safeguard the hermits
while residing there. [3-13-20]

Shlok 21: "Oh, brave one, you see this great forest of flower-liquor trees, you have to
proceed north of it and advance towards a banyan tree. [3-13-21]

Shlok 22: "Then on climbing up an upland a mountain is seen, that which is also not far away,
and that renowned Panchavati is there in an ever-blooming forest in the valley of that mountain."
Said Sage Agastya to Rama. [3-13-22]

Shlok 23: When thus said by Sage Agastya, Rama along with Soumitri venerated and bade farewell
to that truth advocator sage Agastya. [3-13-23]

Shlok 24: Thus well bidden by Sage Agastya those two Rama and Lakshmana have offered their
venerations at the feet of that sage and proceeded to their prospective hermitage at Panchavati
along with Seetha. [3-12-24]

Shlok 25: Those princes that are dauntless in war took up their bows and braced up their
quivers, and resolutely proceeded to Panchavati on the route apprised by that great sage Agastya.
[3-13-25]



SARGA 14
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and the other two on their way to Panchavati come into contact with Jatayu, the mighty 
			eagle. When Rama questions about its identity, Jatayu narrates the creation of animal species 
			along with humans, and informs Rama that he is a friend of King Dasharatha and would like 
			to help Rama in exile.

Shlok 1: Then while proceeding to Panchavati that Rahu's descendent came across a mammoth eagle with marvellous 
might in midway. [3-14-1]

Shlok 2: On seeing such an eagle in the forest those two highly privileged brothers Rama and Lakshmana questioned 
it asking, "Who you are?" presuming it to be a demon. [3-14-2]

Shlok 3: But that eagle with sweet ad soft words spoke to them as though to please them, "oh boy Rama know me 
as your father's friend." [3-14-3]

Shlok 4: Accepting that bird as his father's friend Raghava revered it, and he that Rama then asked for that 
eagle's name and lineage. [3-14-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing Rama's words that bird said about his ancestry and himself, and in doing so, that eagle also 
narrated the overall genesis of all beings. [3-14-5]

Shlok 6: "Once upon a time there were lords of people, oh dextrous Raghava, and you may listen all about them 
from the beginning, while I narrate [3-14-6]

Shlok 7: "Of them Kardama was there at first, and afterwards Sesha, and later Samshraya was there with many children 
and a vigorous one he was. Then Sthaanu, Mariichi, Atri, the great mighty one Kratu, Pulasthya, Angira, 
Pracheta and Pulah were there. And oh, Raghava, Daksha, Vivaswan were while the other name of Vivasvan 
is Arishtanemi, and lastly the great resplendent Kashyapa, was there as Prajapati. [3-14-9] [3-14-7]

Shlok 10: "Oh glorious Rama, there were sixty highly renowned daughters to Daksha, thus we hear. [3-14-10]

Shlok 11- 12a: "Of them Kashyapa accepted eight slender-waisted daughters of Daksha Prajapati, namely Aditi, Diti, 
Danu, Kaalakaa and Taamra, Krodhavasha, also thus Manu and even Anala also as wives. [3-14-11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Then Kashyapa is gladdened and said to those young wives, "You all shall deliver sons similar to me 
and who can sustain the three worlds." [3-14-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, dextrous Rama, Aditi, Diti, Kaalakaa and Danu have agreed for that, but others became unheedful 
of Kashyapa's words. [3-14-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Aditi gave birth to twelve Aditya-s, the Sun-gods, eight Vasu-s, the Terrestrials-gods, eleven Rudraa-s, 
the Fury-gods, and two Ashvinis, the medicine-gods, total thirty-three of them. [3-14-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Oh, boy Rama, Diti gave birth to well-known Daitya-s, the so-called demons, and earlier this earth 
with forests and oceans belonged to them. [3-14-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "And oh, enemy-destroyer Rama, Danu gave birth to son Ashvagriiva or also called Hayagriiva, Horse-headed 
god, and Kaalakaa gave birth to Naraka and Kaalaka. [3-14-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "But Taamraa gave birth to five world renowned girls namely, Krounchi, Bhaasii, Shyenii, Dhritaraashtrii, 
and Shukii. [3-14-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: "And from each of the five daughters of Taamraa in turn emanated are the other avian species, where 
Kraunchii gave birth to Uluuka-s, the owls, Bhasii-s gave birth to Bhaasaa-s, the vultures, and Shyenii 
gave birth to very sharp eagles and falcons, and then Dhritaraashtrii gave birth to swans and all other 
kinds of graceful water-birds. [3-14-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: "Dhritaraashtrii gave birth even to Chakravaaka water-birds, and Shukii gave birth to a daughter Nata, 
and Nata's daughter is Vinata. [3-14-20]

Shlok 21- 22: "Oh, Rama, Krodhavasha gave birth to ten of her self-same daughters namely Mrigi, Mrigamanda, Hari, 
Bhadramanda, Maatangii, Sharduulii, Shweta, Surabhii, and like that to Surasa, who is embodied with 
all giftedness, and even to Kadruva. [3-14-21, 22]

Shlok 23: "Children Mrigi are all of the the deer, oh best of the best-men, Rama, and Mrigamnda's progeny is Riksha-s, 
Bears, a kind of antelope, and like that the Himalayan yak like species.[3-14-23]

Shlok 24: "Then Bhadramanda gave birth to the girl named Iravati and her son is elephant the great, Airaavata, 
the protector of world. [3-14-24]

Shlok 25: "And Hari's offspring are lions and sagely/mighty monkeys, while Sharduulii gave birth to baboons and 
tigers. [3-14-25]

Shlok 26: "Then Maatangi's childrenm are elephants, oh, best one among men, Rama, and Shweta gave birth to eight 
elephants that are at eight quarters of world, sustaining the world on their head. [3-14-26]

Shlok 27: "Then, oh Rama, Surabhi gave birth to two daughters, one is named as illustrious Rohini, safe you 
be, and the other is Gandharvi. [3-14-27]

Shlok 28: "Rohini gave birth to cows and other livestock, while Surasa gave birth to Naagaa-s, viz., many headed 
serpents, while Kadru gave birth to ordinary serpents. [3-124-28]

Shlok 29: "Oh, the best among men Rama, the wife of great-soul Kashyapa, lady Manu procreated humans, Brahman--s, 
Kshatriya-s, Vyasya-s, and Shudra-s. [3-14-29]

Shlok 30: "The Brahman-s emerged from face, the Kshatriya-s from chest, the Vyasya-s from two thighs, and the 
Shudra-s from two feet, thus we hear from the scriptures viz., Veda, i.e., Rig Veda Purusha Shuukta. 
[3-14-30]

Shlok 31: "All the merited fruit-bearing trees are given birth by Anala, and now I will narrate about Vinata, 
the daughter's daughter of Shukii, and about Kadru, the sister of Surasa. [3-14-31]

Shlok 32: "Kadru gave birth to a thousand-headed serpent who is the bearer of this earth, and Vinata gave birth 
to two sons namely Garuda and Aruna. [3-14-32]

[Commentary] Garuda is the eagle-vehicle of Lord Vishnu, while Aruna, also called Anuuru, for he is a thigh-less 
being, is the charioteer of Sun's seven-horse chariot. The seven horses of Sun's chariot are the seven 
colours in vibgyor as in a rainbow. Aruna and Garuda are of avian origination and attributed to be the 
speediest propellers, and Jatayu and Sampati belong to that lineage.

Shlok 33: "Oh enemy-destroyer Rama, I took birth from that Aruna, the charioteer of Sun, and my elder brother 
Sampati too, hence know me as Jatayu, the son of Shyenii. [3-14-33]

Shlok 34: "Such as I am, I can be your helpmate at your residence if only you wish me to... oh, boy, this impassable 
forest is a beloved one to predators and demons, isn't it... as such I can take care of Seetha if you 
and Lakshmana go out..." Thus Jatayu said to Rama. [3-14-34]

Shlok 35: Raghava revered Jatayu in his turn by gladly hugging and stood by him with his head bent, and that kind-natured 
Rama is indeed regardful of the friendship of his father with Jatayu that is repeatedly said by Jatayu. 
[3-14-35]

Shlok 36: He that Rama took the princess from Mithila Seetha, and proceeded to Panchavati along with that very 
mighty bird and Lakshmana, as though to incinerate enemies, like fire that burns down grasshoppers. 
[3-14-36]



SARGA 15
------------------------------

[Text] Rama entrusts the construction work of a parNa shaala, straw-cottage 
			in Panchavati, nearby river Godavari. Lakshmana with all his expertise constructs a cosy 
			cottage and they enter it after the ritual of house-entering ceremony. Rama admires Lakshmana 
			for his construction work and as a thanksgiving he embraces Lakshmana and expresses his 
			heart felt feeling about Lakshmana's concern towards Rama.

Shlok 1: Then on going to Panchavati which is full with many serpents and predators, Rama said to splendidly 
brilliant Lakshmana. [3-15-1]

Shlok 2: "We arrived at the place as indicated by the sage, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this region with its flowered 
forests is Panchavati." [3-15-2]

Shlok 3: "In which place we have to situate our hermitage for our liking, for that cast your sight all over the 
forest, and indeed you are an expert in such matters. [3-15-3]

Shlok 4: "In which place Vaidehi, likewise you and me too can take delight, where the woodland is scenic and 
the water is pleasurable, and where a water lake, ritual-firewood, flowers, and the sacred grass are 
available in proximity, oh, Lakshmana, such a place may be searched out. [3-15-4, 5]

[Commentary] Other versions read the jala raamaNyakam as sthala raamaNyakam. Rama desires a place 
that shall be scenic with flower gardens where Seetha can easily pluck flowers in those gardens. And 
it shall be a pleasurable garden for him to recline, or take his bath etc., and thirdly it shall contain 
the ritual paraphernalia within the reach of Lakshmana, so that Lakshmana can provide them to Rama in 
time, with his obedient service.

Shlok 6: When thus said by Rama, Lakshmana adjoined his palms and said this sentence to Rama in the presence 
of Seetha. [3-15-6]

Shlok 7: "I am but a dependent, as long as you are there, may it be for innumerable years, I am your adherent, 
Rama, therefore you yourself tell me to build hermitage in such and such delightful place. [3-15-7]

[Commentary] Lakshmana is an ever adherent of the Supreme Vishnu as he is the thousand-headed serpent namely 
aadi sheSha, on which Vishnu reclines. Even in this incarnation of Rama, Lakshmana says he is the 
same adherent. Thus Lakshmana wants Rama not to say 'you do it your way' but to order 'you do it my 
way.' Further, Lakshmana is saying this in presence of Seetha, siitaa samakSe, because if she 
is not going to accept that place, Rama rejects it. Hence, it firstly is the choice of Seetha on which 
Rama's approval will be automatic. Thus the question of agreeability or disagreeability of Lakshmana 
does not arise. 'Even in this incarnation in the dynasty of Kakutstha as Rama, I am still subservient 
to you, as I was in vaikuNTha , as aadi sheSa . And this tvayi varSa shatam sthite 
: shata is lexically a hundred but also used in its infinitude, thus 'I am anytime servant 
of yours.' svayam tu ruchire deshe : 'Your choice of place is but my pleasure.' This is to 
portray the self-denial of Lakshmana, apart from any individual identity let alone the devotee status, 
total dedication kainkarya, to the Supreme. This is according to Govindaraja.

[Commentary] Adherent nature of Lakshmana is also like that of a younger brother towards his elder brother, for the 
elder brother becomes father-like after the demise of their father. anenapiturantaram yaavat jyeShTho 
jiivati taavat kaniShThasya na svaatantryam itisuucitam | tathaa ca manuH piteva paalayat sutaan jyeShTha 
bhraataa yaviiyasaH| putravat ca api varteran jyeShTho bhraatari dharmataH || dharmaakuutam.

Shlok 8: Rama is gladdened by those words of that great resplendent Lakshmana, and he selected a place that comprised 
of all the attributes. [3-15-8]

Shlok 9: On taking Lakshmana's hand by his hand Rama paced that beautiful place intended for the construction 
of hermitage up and down and spoke to Soumitri this way. [3-15-9]

Shlok 10: "This is an evenly and propitious place surrounded with flowered trees and it is apt of you to erect 
hermitage here, traditionally. [3-15-10]

Shlok 11: "This pleasing lake is seen here adjacently, beaming forth with its lotuses that are similar to sun 
in resplendence, and that are scented fragrantly. [3-5-11]

[Commentary] The Lake is beaming with lotuses that have the resplendence of Sun. Sun is Vishnu's another aspect,
suurya naaraayaNa , and hence that Vishnu is here in the form of lake. The lotus is the abode 
of Goddess Lakshmi and the lake is full with such lotuses, which are in the heart of the lake. As such 
Goddess Lakshmi is in the lotuses, which again are situated in the heart of Vishnu, and hence this is 
a propitious lake to have Vishnu and Lakshmi together.

Shlok 12- 13a: "This River Godavari is also seen from here, surrounded by blooming trees, spread over with swans, and 
beautified with kaarandava, and chakravaaka birds, as that contemplated soul sage Agastya had said. 
[3-15-12]

Shlok 14: "Those soaring mountains are appearing beautiful with many caves, surrounded by flowered trees, flurried 
by animal herds, sounded by peacocks, and they are neither far-off nor very nearby. [3-15-13, 14]

Shlok 15: "Here and there are the golden, silvery and coppery ores on the mountains, and they are shining forth 
like cow-eye ventilators on walls and also like the superb paintings on elephants. [3-15-15]

[Commentary] The gava aksha is cow-eye, meaning the cow-eye shaped ventilators of walls. The bhakti 
is the name for coloured graphical drawings on the body of elephants. Apart from the howdah and other 
ornamentations, the elephants are richly painted in colours during ceremonial occasions, even today. 
As such Rama is visualising the ore deposits on the mountains as cow-eye like ventilators on walls, 
and as superb streaks of paintings on the bodies of elephants.

Shlok 16: "These mountains are brightening with trees of Saala, Palmyra, Tamaala, Date Palms, Jackfruit and also 
thus with Punnaagaa. With Chuuta - Sweet Mango; Ashoka, Tialaka, even with Ketaka, Champaka trees, And 
even with Syandana, Sandalwood, Niipa, Paarnasa, Lakuch, dhava, Ashwakarna, Khadira, Shamii, Kimshuka, 
Paatala trees, and entwined are those and those trees with flowered shrubs, and along with climbers, 
and thus they brighten the mountains. [3-15-16, 17, 18]

Shlok 19: "This place is holy, this is delightful and this is with many animals and birds, hence Soumitri, let 
us reside here along with this bird Jatayu." Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. [3-15-19]

Shlok 20: Thus said by Rama to that remover of foe's valour and one with very great might, namely Lakshmana, he 
briskly erected a hermitage for his brother. [3-15-20]

Shlok 21- 22- 23: Lakshmana built a very spacious straw-cottage there levelling and raising the clay for raised floor 
of the cottage, strongly pillared with long bamboos, thereupon on those pillars excellent rafters are 
made, and the branches of Shamii trees are spread out, twined firmly with twines of jute strands, and 
with the cross-laid bamboos for thatching, and over that blades of Kusha grass and leaves of Kaasha 
are spread and well over-covered for the roof, and thus that very great mighty Lakshmana made that best 
and very spacious straw-cottage with a levelled surface for residence of Raghava in the interests of 
Raghava alone, and it resulted as a feast to the eye. [3-15-21, 22, 23]

Shlok 24: On his going to River Godavari that noble Lakshmana bathed and on gathering lotuses and fruits he returned 
to the cottage. [3-15-24]

Shlok 25: Then making flowery offerings and peace-invocations also procedural to gR^iha 
pravesha , entering a new house,] started to show the constructed hermitage to Rama. [3-15-25]

Shlok 26: On seeing the beautifully constructed hermitage along with Seetha, Rama is highly gladdened in respect 
that straw-cottage. [3-15-26]

Shlok 27: Then Rama very highly gladdened Rama embraced Lakshmana tightly by both of his hands, and spoke these 
friendly words to him. [3-15-27]

Shlok 28: "Oh, masterful one, I am very happy about you for you have done a great deed, for that reason I am giving 
what I have to give to you a hugging. [3-5-28]

Shlok 29: "You are the knower of others feelings, knower of many skills, and the knower of what is right and honest, 
oh, Lakshmana, such as you are, being with you I deem that my virtue-souled father is not gone and forgotten. 
[3-15-29]

[Commentary] The word bhaavaj~naH means here as the knower of other's feelings. Lakshmana is well aware of 
such things while talking with sages, his brothers, his mothers and his ministers like Hanuma and other 
subjects. Here also Lakshmana knew the feelings of Rama as to how the cottage is envisioned by Rama, 
with due privacy to Rama and Seetha, with a porch, worship-room, and an accommodation for himself.
kR^itaj~na is masterly craftsmanship and flair for doing all deeds of sublime nature, but not 
'faithful' in routine sense. dharmaj~naH is knower of honesty. Though he himself is a prince, 
Lakshmana did not construct the cottage for his comfort, but the convenience of Rama and Seetha are 
counted firstly. The word dharmaatmaa , virtue souled one, can also be prefixed to Dasharatha 
like dharmaatmaa mama pitaa virtue-souled, my, father, meaning that 'the virtue-souled Dasharatha 
has left you behind him for my sake, because you are arranging all the things for me, as a father would 
naturally do for his son.' The word sam vR^ittaH in the observation of Dr. Satya Vrat in his 
book 'The Ramayana - A Linguistic Study is:--  This word has been found used in a rather remarkable sense 
[in Ramayana.] It is 'to die'. sam vR^ittaH means dead. Ordinarily samvR^ittaH has 
quite the opposite sense, viz., 'born', i.e., father Dasharatha took rebirth as Lakshmana, to provide 
for the needs of Rama.

[Commentary] And Dharmaakuutam says that, anena 
mR^ite api pitaadhaarmikeNa putreNa amR^ita iti suucitam | tathaa ca vaajasaneya braahmaNa~N-- 'saputreNa 
eva asmin loke pratitiShThati -- ' iti | sa ca pitaa svayam mR^ite apidhaarmiksya putrasy shariireNa 
eva asmin loke yathaa shaastram karma kurvan tiShThatiiti artham|| dhamaakuutam Hence 
Rama said in this concept also that - 'my father is though 'dead', but 'born' again in you, Lakshmana.'

Shlok 30: On saying thus to Lakshmana, Raghava, the enhancer of magnificence comfortably resided in that province 
which is with many a fruit. [3-15-30]

[Commentary] The last word sukhii is read as vashii in other mms meaning that Rama 'with his senses 
controlled' lived there. That is to suggest the overcoming of the enchantment of Suurpanakha.

Shlok 31: While Seetha and Lakshmana devoted themselves to that righteous Rama, he resided in Panchavati like 
a Divinity in heavenly world for sometime to come. [3-15-30]



SARGA 16
------------------------------

[Text] On one day before the sunrise Rama proceeds to River Godavari for daily bath along with 
			Seetha and Lakshmana. On the way looking at the nature around Lakshmana eulogises winter 
			season. In doing so he casts aspersions on queen Kaikeyi, and Rama reproves it.

Shlok 1: Pleasant hemantha R^itu , pre-winter season has set in after the passage of sharat R^itu, 
post-rainy season at Panchavati where the noble souled Rama is staying comfortably. [4-16-1]

Shlok 2: On some day when night faded into dawn Rama started for the delightful River Godavari for a bath. [4-16-2]

Shlok 3: His valorous brother Saumitri following him humbly with a handy vessel, along with Seetha, spoke this 
to Rama. [4-16-3]

Shlok 4: "Adorned by which season the promising year will be bright, oh, pleasant conversationalist, and which 
season will also be pleasant to you, that hemanta season has set in. [4-16-4]

Shlok 5: "These days the dew is harsh to the bodies of people, earth is overlaid with crops, water is unenjoyable, 
but fire is delightful. [4-16-5]

Shlok 6: "On appeasing manes with worships during northern solstice and even on performing solstitial rituals 
in time, the righteous people are becoming free from evils. [4-16-6]

[Commentary] The ritual agraayaNa is a havis , oblation performed after the arrival of harvest 
at home from fields and before the start of its usage. Usually this is the time of Makara Sankranti, 
the starting day of northern solstice. na anviShTa aagraayaNe na aahitaagni navasya 
ashniiyaat vriihiinaam yavaanaam shyaamakaanaam iti agra paakasya yajeta -- aapasthamba suutra

Shlok 7: "Amply fulfilled are the desires of the villagers with the affluence of milch cows and dairy, and the 
vanquishing kings are make moves for the purposes of their further vanquishes. [4-16-7]

Shlok 8: "While the sun is steadfastly attending the direction of Time-god Yama, namely southern horizon, the 
northern direction is not brilliant like a woman who lost the vermilion mark on her forehead. [4-16-8]

[Commentary] The tilaka is the vermilion mark of sindur , vermilion-red powder specially made out 
of turmeric and limejuice and other ingredients and called as kunkuma . This is sacred and 
used in daily worships and applied as a mark on forehead at a place where the Third Eye, j~naana 
netra is said to exist. For the women this mark is for their glorification of womanhood by virtue 
of the existence of her husband. Should she become a widow this mark is made no more and her face will 
become dullish for she is without a husband. So also the sun is such a mark on the forehead of the woman 
called horizon. Without him no quarters glitter.

Shlok 9: "By their very nature Himalayas are the depositories of snow, and presently distanced from the sun they 
are very obviously snowy true to their name. [4-16-9]

Shlok 10: "By the way of touch the mid days are comfortable and in these days the daytime is very much comfortable 
for sauntering, thus the sun in daytimes is genial and ungenial are the shades and waters. [4-16-10]

Shlok 11: "Overwhelmed by snow presently the noontimes are with soft sun, with bitter cold, with mists and wintry 
breezes, and with them the forests too are bleak in their sheen. [4-16-11]

Shlok 12: "Precluded is the reclining under open sky as the nights are led by the Pushya constellation, they will 
now be with brownish-grey fog and chilly, and prolonged are the lengths of nights whereby the three 
watches of night will be quickly slipping away.

[Commentary] The three yaamaa-s or praharaH-s, are three hours or three watches, where each 
yaama, is three hours. The commentators said that nivR^itta aakaasha shayanaa : precluded 
are troubles to those that are reclining in heavens i.e., divine beings; vR^iddha tara tri yaamaa 
: prolonged are the nightly activities of demons. puSya aaniitaa , where puSya also 
means Kali, the doom, and the demons are brining it up. Thus Lakshmana is said to have reminded Rama 
about the purpose of his incarnation, where the gods are precluded from a restful reclining, the nightly 
activities of demons are on the increase, and the demons are bringing doom time, so Rama has to quicken 
their eradication.

Shlok 13: "Transgressed is the destiny of moon by the sun as moon lost the chance of keeping people happy with 
his lustrousness in these days, thus the lustreless moon remained in a blushing sphere with fog, just 
like a mirror blinded by the fog of a suspire. [4-16-13]

Shlok 14: "Even on a full moon day the moonlight is unbright blemished by mist, and it is appearing like brightly 
Seetha becoming swarthy by sun's heat, but not brightly. [4-16-14]

Shlok 15: "The western breeze by itself will be cool to touch, but presently charged with snow it is wafting doubly 
chilly in the early hours. [4-16-15]

[Commentary] The vernal breeze will be cool by its nature and so is the Omnipotent. Now the snowy dew enriches the 
breeze's coolness. So also the Omnipotent, namely Rama, is doubly cool by the coolness of the prayers 
of divinities and the sages as well. Govindaraja.

Shlok 16: "Covered with the dew the forests that already covered with crop fields of barley and wheat are beaming 
forth, together with the callings of waterfowls, at the rise of the sun. [4-16-16]

[Commentary] The sun now risen is Rama. The word baaSpa also means tears. The fertile lands are shedding 
tears in fear of Ravana. Again baaSpaH is vapour that spreads. Rama's benevolence is spreading 
like vapour. The forests are with full crops. The lands are full with asceticism and Vedic practices 
to receive the mercy of Rama. The birds' callings are the echoing of Vedic sonority. Govindaraja. The
yava grains are not exactly western barley grains as usually shown in lexicons. It is called 
locally as jov dhaan and is used in fire oblations, . It is a dietary prescription to diabetics 
nowadays.

Shlok 17: "The paddy crops in fields are gleaming forth with golden lustre, and their heads full with grain and 
a little bent down are shapely like the flowers of date-fruit. [4-16-17]

[Commentary] The heads of crops are a little bent down by weight of corn, like the heads of sages who bow down with 
the weight of knowledge before the Absolute. Thus their age-old golden hair is gleaming at the first 
rays of sun. Govindaraja.

Shlok 18: "Though he came up long back, and though his beams are spreading around, besieged by snowy mist the 
sun is appearing as moon. [4-16-18]

[Commentary] The sun again is Rama. 'Though you have risen in the vast of forests long back and avowed to eradicate 
demons, has your radiance decreased like the vernal sun, while the demons are still radiant by their 
activities...' is the question of Lakshmana. Govindaraja.

Shlok 19: Inappreciable is the warmth of sun in the mornings, but comfortable for touch at noontimes, since the 
reddish but a little palish sunshine is radiating on earth. [4-16-19]

[Commentary] The warmth of the sun is his valour which is usurped by the snowy mist. Rama's valour is usurped or 
inappreciable by his taciturnity. Then Lakshmana is deemed to have said, 'The demons are dominating 
the nature with their cold-blooded activities like coldish snow, oh, Rama, sustaining them with kind 
of cool profile of yours is inapt of you...' Govindaraja.

Shlok 20: "The pasturelands are a little moistened with the fall of dewdrops, but the fields of forest are enlivened 
by the radiance of tender sun's warmth. [4-16-20]

[Commentary] The pastureland are like the serene sages who are wetting their faces with droplets of merciful tears 
by the activities of the demons. And now the warmth of the tender sun / valour of Rama, is radiating 
on the countenances of pasturelands/sages which will be furious henceforth. Govindaraja.

Shlok 21: "On easily touching very clear and cold water with its very broad trunk that intensely thirsty wild 
elephant is backing away its trunk for the water is that cold. [4-16-21]

[Commentary] Gods are withdrawing to touch pleasurable items that are usually enjoyable to them, fearing Ravana. 
Govindaraja

Shlok 22: "These waterfowls that are sitting nearby are not entering into waters like cowards not entering battlefields. 
[4-16-22]

[Commentary] The waterfowls are compared with the sages. The sages though staying nearby asceticism, like birds sitting 
on riverbanks, are not able to enter into its enjoyable main realm, namely samaadhi, concentration. 
Another way is 'oh Rama, though you are an expert in warfare why you are backing away for a war with 
demons? Why not jump to it? Are you like these fearing waterfowls?'

Shlok 23: "Subdued by snowy darkness, enclosed in misty gloom, and reft of flowers these forest ranges appear 
like those that are asleep. [4-16-23]

[Commentary] Mantled by darkness and dewdrops dribbling, the leaves and leaflets are crouched and look like sleeping 
ones. Further blanketed by the mist they are appearing as those that are sleeping covering a blanket. 
Flowers are not blooming like the closed eyes of a sleeper. Thus the woodlands are asleep. Govindaraja.

[Commentary] For those who are asleep it is a double darkness. One is the darkness of sleep, while the other is the 
darkness of night. They not only crouch in themselves with the inner darkness, but as they are also 
enfolded by the external darkness of night, they further crouch in. Maheshvara Tiirtha. By this sleep 
attribute, the dormant disposition of sages is made evident.

Shlok 24: "Now the rivers are imperceptible as their water is overspread with dewdrops, but their water-birds 
are perceptible only by their callings, thus making that river perceptible, and such rivers are now 
glistening with moist sandbanks and shores. [4-16-24]

[Commentary] By rivers the sages are denominated and they are all enshrouded by the mist called the fear of demons, 
and they are perceptible just by their groaning. They are unable to come out of that misty climate, 
as good as waterfowls dependent on rivers.

Shlok 25: "Owing to the fall of snow, further owing to the softness and coldness of sun, the water deep down the 
wells is generally agreeable for drinking. [4-16-25]

[Commentary] This falling of the snow is indicative of the falling of demons upon sages, and sun's softness is with 
the soft attitude of Rama. Tiirtha.

Shlok 26: "Lotus lakes are left alone with stalks of lotuses as their petals are aged and withered, decrepit are 
the fibrils and carpels, thus impaired by cold they are ungracious in look. [4-16-26]

[Commentary] When the demons destroy the lake-like hermitages and their inmates, aged and withered sages and their 
lotus-petal like austerities are shattered by the hostilities of demons, and the remaining hermits are 
just like the stalks of lotuses left behind.

Shlok 27: "But during this time, oh, manly-tiger, ushered by anguish that virtue souled one Bharata must be practising 
ascesis in city with adoration to you. [4-16-27]

Shlok 28: "On forsaking kingdom and pride of becoming the king of Ayodhya as well, and varied and various pleasures 
too, he is in self-denial, and with his food regulated he sleeps on chilly surface of earth. [4-16-28]

[Commentary] So far Lakshmana spoke about spring season indicating the sufferings of saints and sages by the chill 
and icy effects of demons indirectly. Now his broodings are turning to Bharata, for Bharata is avowed 
to self-immolate if Rama were not to come after a fixed time, and Rama is lingering here.

Shlok 29: "Even he might always be getting up at this time of the day and proceeding to River Sarayu for a bath 
surrounded by ministers, definite is that. [4-16-29]

Shlok 30: "But how can he who is brought up in high comfort, a delicate one too, enter the cold-wet waters of 
River Sarayu, in these small hours. [4-16-30]

[Commentary] The compound atyanta sukha samvriddhaH brought up in comfort is but natural to a prince, but 
it is in its princely loftiness. But our father King Dasharatha has made it loftier. And you by your 
brotherly caring , you also looked Bharata. atyanata sukumaaraH  by his feelings he is a delicate 
one who cannot tolerate your absence'. In other mms it is sukhochita in place of hima aardra 
which means  one who is habituated to pleasures of a younger prince,' but not to become a monk in these 
early years of his youth. So you should relieve him of his vow. This is the import of Lakshmana's address 
to Rama.

Shlok 31: "That lotus-petal eyed one with blue-black complexion is an imposing one with lion-like waist, being 
the noblest he is knower of dharma thus an advocate of truth, and thus intolerant of ignominy, and as 
a self-restrained one he talks dearly and sweetly, and he is dextrous and an enemy-destroyer, such as 
he is, that Bharata on forgoing all of his various pleasures he is devoted to you, as you alone are 
his adorable brother. [4-16-31, 32]

[Commentary] Stomachless is not to say that Bharata is without a stomach but has a palm-like concave stomach, but 
not a potbelly to stomach the kingdom of Ayodhya that is easily usurped through his mother Kaika.

Shlok 33: "Even though you are in forests far away from him, he is following you in the practise of austerities, 
and such a brother of yours, that great-souled Bharata has refused ascent to heaven. [4-16-33]

[Commentary] Bharata though staying in kingdom he is observing asceticism following the trend of Rama. By grief Bharata 
might have been dead, like King Dasharatha, and ascended to heavens. But Bharata's going to heavens 
is a hindrance in getting a glimpse of Rama after return from exile. So Bharata's refusing the heavens 
is said to be his conquering heavens. Lakshmana is quickening Rama's thinking to take some action to 
complete his mission in eradicating the demonic atrocities and quickly return to Ayodhya, lest time 
slips by and Bharata may self-immolate. After these many thoughts, now Lakshmana starts to move the 
eye of the needle towards Kaikeyi, the root cause for all miseries.

Shlok 34: "  Humans do not derive father's attitude but they take of their mothers' is the well-know maxim in 
the world, but Bharata rendered it otherwise. [4-16-34]

[Commentary] This is a proverbial saying that humans inherit mother's characteristics but not father's. But Bharata 
renders it otherwise for he has not inherited the mean and sordid nature of Kaikeyi. This proverbial 
saying is still in use in all languages in India, with a little change. In Marathi it is khaanaa 
tashii maatii va jaatii tashii potii' after Dr. Satya Vrat. This stems up from the Sanskrit
dhanyaa 
pitR^i mukhii kanyaa dhanyaa maatR^i mukhaH sutaH 'Blest is father-like daughter, 
blest is mother-like son.'

Shlok 35: "Whose husband is Dasharatha and whose son is gentle Bharata, how then can she, our mother Kaikeyi, 
is with this sort of cruel disposition, indeed " Thus Lakshmana spoke to Rama on their way to River 
Godavari. [4-16-35]

[Commentary] Rama uses the same wording for Kaikeyi as  our middle mother' at 3-2-19b-20

Shlok 36: When that upright Lakshmana is speaking those words that way out of his fondness towards Rama, Raghava 
spoke to Lakshmana, intolerant of that slanderous talk about their mother. [4-16-36]

Shlok 37: "In any way, dear Lakshmana, you are not supposed to deplore another mother of ours, but you go on telling 
the topics of Bharata, the king of Ikshvaku-s. [4-16-37]

Shlok 38: "My mind is indeed set to dwell only in forest, and it is firmly avowed, but while yearning for Bharata's 
fellowship my fascination to reunite with him is recurring again. [4-16-38]

Shlok 39: "I reminisce his words well, that are genial, sweet, heartily, ambrosial and that will gladden the heart. 
[4-16-39]

Shlok 40: "When can I really reunite, oh, Lakshmana, with great-souled Bharata, valorous Shatrughna, and with 
you and Seetha." Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-16-40]

[Commentary] Usually the word ca means 'also, and.' In compound tvayaa ca raghunandana it is said 
to indicate Seetha.

Shlok 41: Thus worrying that way while proceeding, there Rama reached River Godavari and performed bathing with 
his younger brother Lakshmana and along with Seetha. [4-16-41]

Shlok 42: Then on offering water oblations to manes and gods that impeccant trinity extolled the rising sun and 
gods likewise. [4-16-42]

Shlok 43: On taking bath in the river along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama shone forth like All-controlling god 
Rudra, who will be radiant on taking bath along with his consort Paarvati and with his follower Nandi, 
the Holy Bull. [4-16-43]

[Commentary] The similitude between Rama and Shiva suggests that Rama is about to start destruction of demons.



The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is 
a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed 
to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya , and that which is 
pious and merited puNyam vedaischa samamatam at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons   is 
the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord 
with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology,
veda-anga : jyotiShya . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda.
uShaa 
vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyaka 
Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s.



Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, 
for e.g., hemanta spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And vasanta post autumnal 
season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and 
after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. varSa rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter 
of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do 
explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said:
vedopabR^ihmaNaartham 
pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa 
lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam 
kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j~naapanaartham eva kR^itam 
iti dharma paryavasaanam sambhavati eva -- dharmaakuutam



Thus dharma is upheld in 
all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they 
too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs.



SARGA 17
------------------------------

[Text] Shuurpanakha, the problem demoness of Ramayana enters here. She approaches the cottage of Rama and offers 
her wifehood to Rama. She is the sister of Ravana and her husband Vidyut Jihva was murdered by Ravana 
alone, rendering his own sister a widow. She being an age-old demoness wants Rama to marry her, leaving 
Seetha off.

Shlok 1: On taking bath Rama with Seetha and Soumitri, then went to his own hermitage from that bank of River 
Godavari. [3-17-1]

Shlok 2: Nearing that hermitage Raghava along with Lakshmana performed early morning rituals and then reached 
the cottage. [3-17-2]

Shlok 3: There Rama comfortably spent time while being adored by eminent sages when he is with them, and narrating 
many a narrative while sitting in hermitage along with Seetha and his brother Lakshmana, thus he shone 
forth like the moon when with Chitra constellation. [3-1-7-3, 4]

[Commentary] The Chitra star is with clearest whiteness against the sky-blue background and thus it is said citra 
mauktikam ekam 'Chitra star and a pearl are one in colour.' Thus sky-blue coloured Rama is the 
moon while pearl white Seetha is pearl white Chitra star.

Shlok 5: At one time when Rama is sitting in hermitage and heartily absorbed in telling narratives some demoness 
arrived at that place, fortuitously. [3-17-5]

Shlok 6: She is but the sister of ten-faced demon Ravana, Shuurpanakha by her name and she has seen him on reaching 
the paradisiacal being like Rama. [3-17-6]

Shlok 7: He whose face is radiant, arms lengthy, eyes large like lotus petals, stride like that of an elephant, 
wearing bunches of hair-tufts, delicate yet greatly vigorous, possessor of all kingly aspects, complexion 
deep-blue like blue lotus, similar to Love-god in brilliance and in simile to Indra, the demoness has 
seen such a Rama and became lovesick. [3-17-7, 8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10- 11- 12a: She that demoness who is facially unpleasant one with that pleasant faced one, pot bellied one with 
the slim-waisted one, wry-eyed one with the broad-eyed one, coppery-haired one with the neatly tressed 
one, ugly featured one with the charming featured one, brassy voiced one with the gentle voiced one, 
deplorably oldish one with the youngish one, crooked talker with the pleasant talker, ill-mannered one 
with the well-mannered one, uncouth one with couth, abominable one with amiable Rama spoke, besieged 
by Love-god. [3-17-9b, 11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13: "You are an ascetic yet with a wife, handling bow and arrows yet in the appearance of a sage  what for 
you have come to this province frequented by demons  it will be apt of you to tell the purpose of your 
coming here, in actuality " [3-17-12b, 13]

Shlok 14: Thus asked by demoness Shuurpanakha that enemy-scorcher Rama started to inform all about it, straightforwardly. 
[3-17-14]

Shlok 15: "A king named Dasharatha was there with his godlike valour, I am his eldest son, and people hear of 
me by name Rama. [3-17-15]

Shlok 16: "He is Lakshmana by his name, my younger brother and a devoted follower of mine, and she is my wife, 
daughter of Videha's king, well-known as Seetha. [3-17-16]

Shlok 17: "Desiring to implement the probity in following father's orders and for the sake of establishing probity 
in living an ascetic's life I have come here to forests to dwell, as enjoined by the directives of the 
king and my father, and by my mother, as well. [3-17-17]

Shlok 18: "I too wish to know about you. Whose wife are you? What is your name? Or, whose daughter are you? By 
the way, you are with a most enthralling personality, and then you must be a demoness. [3-17-18]

[Commentary] So far the handsomeness of Shuurpanakha is not narrated in these verses. But Rama's addressing her as 
a handsome woman is for fun sake, so some commentators say. The episode Shuurpanakha is considered to 
have haasya rasa, comic relief. Refusing the unnecessarily joking of Rama some say that Shuurpanakha 
came there with an exquisite form. And what all said negatively about her in preceding verses is the 
implicit idea of the poet. Taking the entrance of Shuurpanakha with a beautiful personality every cinema 
that is shot on Ramayana gives a cabaret dance with inciting song to Shuurpanakha at this situation.

[Commentary] In some other mms there are a few more verses that contain a situation where Jatayu comes to Rama to 
take leave of him to go and see his relatives and bird-friends, after Rama returns from the river. Then, 
knowing that Jatayu is not there Shuurpanakha enters the cottage area with a guise of winsome beauty. 
No demon or demoness can approach that cottage of Rama, as long as Jatayu is there - is the point for 
establishment. While the difference in mms/texts is between one or two letters like, na hi taavat 
manoj~na angii and tvam hi taavat manoj~na angii , whether the poet entered Shuurpanakha 
in a fashionable getup or as an old female is another point that remained inconclusive.

Shlok 19: "What for you have come, either, you tell in actuality..." Thus Rama asked her. On hearing the words 
of Rama she that demoness wetted with love said these words. [3-17-19]

Shlok 20- 21a: "I will tell you truth, Rama, nothing but truth, I am a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpanakha, 
and I will be freely moving in this forest in a solitary manner and unnerving all. [3-17-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: "My brother is valorous and mighty Ravana, the king of demons and the son of Vishravasa, if ever you 
have heard of him. [3-17-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23: "And the mighty Kumbhakarna who will always be in profound sleep is my brother, and the virtue-souled 
Vibheeshana too is my brother, but he does not behave like a demon, and two more bothers of mine are 
Khara and Duushana who are renowned for their bravery in war. [3-17-22b, 23

Shlok 24: "I can excel all of them by my bravery, oh, Rama, and on seeing you for the first time I had a notion 
that you being the choicest among men you alone are my husband, hence I neared you. [3-17-24]

Shlok 25: "I am endowed with such preponderances and I can operate with my independent might, as such you become 
my everlasting husband  by the way, what can you bring off with Seetha. [3-17-25]

Shlok 26: "Unlovely and unshapely is this one, such as she is, this Seetha is unworthy to be your wife, and I 
am the lone one worthy to be your wife, hence treat me as your wife. [3-17-26]

Shlok 27: "Shall I eat up this disfigured, dishonest, diabolical human female with a hallow stomach along with 
him, that brother of yours to make you free.

[Commentary] Lakshmana will use the very same wording in the next chapter when retorting Shuurpanakha.

Shlok 28: "Afterwards, you can lustily ramble about Dandaka forest along with me while enjoying yourself on various 
mountaintops in the sky and in forests on the earth." So Shuurpanakha said to Rama. [3-17-28]

Shlok 29: When he is said that way Rama chuckled and that wordsmith started to reply her who eyes are besotted 
in lovesickness with this sentence. [3-17-29]



SARGA 18
------------------------------

[Text] Rama averts Shuurpanakha's advances toward him and asks her to seek Lakshmana instead. Lakshmana 
			uses wordplay in retorting her in her own words. But she takes the apparent meaning of Lakshmana's 
			words and rushes to eat away Seetha. Lakshmana defaces her and she noisily runs away from 
			there, only to report to her brother Khara, a violent demon. This is the triggering situation 
			of another round of troubles to Rama and Ramayana.

Shlok 1: Rama then voicing clearly and softly spoke to her, whom the noose of lust has tethered down, with a 
smile preceding his words. [3-18-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, honourable one, I am married and this is my dear wife, thus it will be distressing for your sort 
of females to live with a co-wife. [3-18-2]

Shlok 3: "He is my younger brother named Lakshmana, he is with a good conduct, good looking, a promising and 
valiant one, and he is without a wife. [3-18-3]

[Commentary] Rama is punning here. In punning apparent meaning will be different than the latent and the apparent 
appears to an untruth. Then if it is questioned whether Rama tells a lie while joking or punning, it 
is not so: nyaaya - guruuNam api samam haasyam kartavyam kutilam vinaa 'even with teachers 
one can be humorous, if it is not fraudulent'. According to dharmaakuutam which quotes 
gautam suutra: vivaaha maithuna narma aatra saMyogeSu adoSakakameke anR^itam; and in aapad 
dharma suutra: na narma yuktam anR^itam hi na asti na striiSu raajan na vivaaha kaale 'at the time 
of marriage or copulation or with women talking untruth [or with innuendo, or punning,] is not wrong.'

[Commentary] Again if it be asked whether Rama really said in jocular way or in real sense, it is said that he has 
not joked. navevamapi raama vacanam parihaasa ruupamiti katham nishcitamiti cet na for this 
Rama's words at 3-18-19 will suffice, saumitre parihaasaH kathaMcana 'Lakshmana.... no joking 
with this kind of beings please...' dharmaakuutam.

[Commentary] Rama is known to be a jovial talker, na vitathaa parihaasa kathhasvapi Here for the word
a kR^ita daaraH apparently means 'not, made, wife= wife not available.' But Lakshmana is married 
and Rama says here he is unmarried. Then Rama must have bluffed! Not so, that compound is in its subtext 
means: 'one who did not make his wife to come along, hence there is no wife.' Govindaraja.

[Commentary] In another way, the word a in a kR^ite also means antaHpura according to 
the thesaurus of a and it is said as: akaaro brahma vishNu iisha kamaTheSva~NgaNe, gaurave 
antaHpure palace-chambers of queens; and thus the meaning is as: 'one who left behind his wife 
in palace-chambers, hence he has no wife.'

Shlok 4: "He is without a wife and in need of a wife  he is youthful, good-looking and he can become a fitly 
husband of yours, fit enough to your kind of features. [3-18-4]

[Commentary] The word apuurvi means in the viewpoint of Rama 'one who has been missing the company of wife 
for a long' but in Shuurpanakha's view it is 'one who is missing the company of ANY wife for a long...' 
The word bhaaryaa ca arthii is from Rama's view 'desiring his own wife, Urmila' but in Shuurpanakha's 
view 'desiring ANY woman as wife' and the word te bhartaa is declined as te.abhartaa= te 
a bhartaa 'unfit to be your husband' because of your ruupasya asyaa 'by your aspect, your 
repulsive aspect.' Govindaraja.

[Commentary] In another way akR^ita daaraH 'already a married man' apuurvii 'one who does not have 
the comfort from wife' so bharyayaa ca arthii; a + puurva bhaaryayaa ca arthii 'for a new wife, 
also, desiring one; one who is desiring new wife; thus you are a fitly wife for him by your aspect,
anuruupascha te . This is on joculary side of the statement parihaasa anukuula praatiitaka 
artha. The implicit meaning is akR^ita daaraH 'one without a wife now or one who does 
not take another wife.' apuurva bhaaryayaa by first wife alone, arthii he is desired;
shiilavaan, eka patnii vrata shiila vantaH an abider in the syndrome of 'one-man-one-wife.'
priya darshanaH 'in dear ones, tend towards; tending towards his dear ones.' te.abhrtaa= 
te + a + bhartaa 'for you, no, husband; he is no husband of yours, he can never be your husband.'
anu ruupaH 'fit for his own wife.' asya ruupasya yogya bhaviSyati? 'with this kind 
of, aspect of yours   for you with such a notorious aspect, will he be eligible to become your husband? 
No, he will not.' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

[Commentary] The word apuurvi is categorised under rare and unfamiliar words. It is said that as per rock 
edicts it is a traveller, brahmacaari celibate, who is studying apuurva, namely Veda-s. 
As mimaamsikaa-s tell us that apuurva is divineness, results from Vedic knowledge. 
Here the celibate state of Lakshmana is said to have been referred, 'though he is having his wife Urmila, 
he is undergoing celibacy.' And further 'In Gorresio's text it is there as taruNo bhaaryayaa ca 
arthii where taruNa is youthfulness. Rama is also youthful. So Rama's expression of
apurvii is just to indicate Lakshmana as a brahmacaari a celibate, though he has a 
wife and youthful also. After Prof. Satya Vrat. Unchained is he by nuptial bands: is Griffith's wording.

Shlok 5: "You woo him, oh, board-eyed [bulged-eyed] one, this brother of mine as your husband like sunshine seeking 
the Mt. Meru, then oh, great-waisted [pot-bellied] one, you will be without a co-wife " So said Rama 
to that demoness. [3-18-5]

[Commentary] The sunshine seeking Mt. Meru will spread over it, and on going at its behind, the sun disappears along 
with his shine. Such a massive mountain is that. Thus Mt. Meru is an absolver nivR^itti pradaata 
of sunshine. So also you reach Lakshmana and become absolved in him / by him. Govindaraja. Secondly, 
you adore Lakshmana like bhartaaram a husband, a Providence of all in the universe. Maheshvara 
Tiirtha.

Shlok 6: When Rama clearly told that way to that demoness dazed in lust, discarding Rama quickly then she spoke 
to Lakshmana. [3-18-6]

Shlok 7: "I with my best complexion will be your deserving wife meetly to you charm, you can happily take a jaunt 
all over Dandaka forest along with me." So Shuurpanakha ran after Lakshmana. [3-18-7]

Shlok 8: Thus said by the demoness that meaningful sentence maker Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, then smiled 
and appropriately replied Shuurpanakha. [3-18-8]

Shlok 9: "How you wish to become a female servant, oh, [black] lotus-coloured one, by becoming the wife of a 
servant like me? I am just a vassal of my adorable brother. [3-18-9]

Shlok 10: "Oh, goggle eyed one, befitting to your complexion that is un-stainable further you better become the 
wife of my brother Rama who is abounding in means, and on becoming the younger wife of that adorable 
one, you too will achieve your means and thus you will be happy. [3-18-10]

[Commentary] The word samR^iddha artha is 'abounding in the means of salvation.' arthobhidheyaraiH vastu 
prayojana nivR^itteSu nivR^itti 'Rama will accord salvation to you, should you adore him as your 
ultimate husband, thereby your means too are achieved and you can be happy.' The compound mudita 
amala varnaNi when declined as a + mudita; mala varNinii will mean: ' you have no happiness, 
filthy is your complexion.' yaviiyasii bhaaryaa; 'you are an unhappy creature with a filthy 
complexion and you will become a worst possible wife of Rama... do you wish to become at least that 
worst wife? No, never you can.' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 11: "On discarding her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolically deleterious old wife with a hallow stomach 
that Rama will adore you alone. [3-18-11]

[Commentary] Lakshmana tolerates anything but lets no fly to fly over Seetha. He may defy his brother Rama, but never 
tolerates belittlement of Seetha, and lets none to insult her. Now he is retorting Shuurpanakha in the 
same words she used in last chapter when she was speaking about Seetha.

[Commentary] Here Govindaraja says, viruupaama asatiim karaalaam nirNatatodariim vR^idhaam tvaam parityajya enaam 
bhaaryaam eva eSa 'oh, Shuurpanakha you are un-shapely, unworthy etc., so Rama will leave you off, 
and adores his own wife, Seetha only...' Govindaraja.

[Commentary] Next, Maheshvara Tirtha says the same verse with reference to Seetha, it is: vi + ruupaam= visheSa 
ruupaam= tri loka sundariim with a particular excellence in her beauty in all three worlds; 
a + satiim= na anya pativrataa syaat samam vaa adhikam none, equalling or better in husband-adoration;
karaalaam= karaalo daMture tunge daaruNe api ca, tallish; nirNata udariim hallow-stomached, 
slender-waisted, the first attribute a comely lady should have; vR^iddhaam= j~naana, shiila, guNa 
saMvR^ddhi 'abounding with intellect, character, conduct etc., not just years of age...'

[Commentary] 'Seetha is one with a particular excellence in her beauty in all three worlds, none is equalling or 
higher to her in husband-adoration, a tallish lady, slender-waisted and in her enriched are intellect, 
character and conduct... how can she be left off for your sake?' This is the innuendo of Lakshmana's 
wording. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 12: "Oh, best complexioned one with best waist, is there any wiseacre to simply discard your kind of best 
personality, indeed, in preference to human females?" Lakshmana said so to Shuurpanakha. [3-18-12]

Shlok 13: Thus said by Lakshmana that despicable one with slouching stomach Shuurpanakha presumed those words 
to be truthful, for she is equivocal of that equivoque. [3-18-13]

Shlok 14: She who is fuddle by lust said to that unassailable enemy scorcher Rama who is sitting in the cottage 
along with Seetha. [3-18-14]

Shlok 15: "Tenacious of her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolical, hallow-stomached old wife of yours you are 
not regarding me high. [3-18-15]

Shlok 16: "Now I wish to eat up this human female right before your very eyes, and then I can blithely make merry 
along with you, without the botheration of a co-wife." Said Shuurpanakha to Rama. [3-18-16]

Shlok 17: Speaking that way she that torch-eyed Shuurpanakha dashed towards the deer-eyed Seetha in high exasperation 
as a great meteor would dash towards Rohini, the brightest star in the sky. [3-18-17]

Shlok 18: By that the great-energetic Rama took umbrage and checking her who is like the noose of death swooping 
down on Seetha said to Lakshmana. [3-18-18]

Shlok 19: "Punning in any way with the base and brutish is inapposite, oh, gentle Saumitri, mark note of Vaidehi, 
somehow surviving  [3-18-19]

Shlok 20: "She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this 
paunchy demoness " Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [3-18-20]

Shlok 21: Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before 
the very eyes of Rama. [3-18-21]

Shlok 22: On hewing off her ears and nose she that ghastly Shuurpanakha blared highly and discordantly, and very 
speedily fled into forest as she came. [3-18-22]

Shlok 23: She that very ghastly demoness when defaced is wetted by blood and blared many a blare like a cloud 
in cloudburst. [3-18-23]

Shlok 24: She that gruesome one in her appearance clasped herself and thunderously entered similarly gruesome 
forest while her blood fountained and profusely exuded. [3-18-24]

Shlok 25: Then she who is deformed neared her brother Khara who possess violent vigour, who is abiding in Janasthaana 
and who is presently surrounded by his band of his hench-demons, and before him she that Shuurpanakha 
fell onto ground like a thunderbolt from the sky. [3-18-25]

Shlok 26: Then that sister of Khara who is convulsed in the fluster of fear and her body wetted with blood reported 
to her brother Khara, all about Rama's arrival in forest with his wife and Lakshmana, and even about 
his misshaping her. [3-18-26]



SARGA 19
------------------------------

[Text] Shuurpanakha narrates her woeful story to her brother Khara ncriminating Seetha in particular. She wants 
Khara to wage a war so that she could drink Seetha's blood. Khara in order to appease his sister sends 
fourteen demons to eliminate Rama.

Shlok 1: On seeing her who fell before him in a misshapen and blood-soaked condition, demon Khara is all stewed 
up and asked her. [3-19-1]

Shlok 2: "Rise up, first tell me clearly putting away your flurry and fluster, who disfigured your form in this 
way. [3-19-2]

Shlok 3: "Who for sport is poking his fingertip at a venomously fanged black-cobra that has chanced in his close 
proximity but slouching down inoffensively. [3-19-3]

Shlok 4: "Who on harrowing you is now heedless about his gulping a deadly poison, or about his foolish bracing 
the noose of Time around his own neck. [3-19-4]

Shlok 5: "You are gifted with boldness and braveness, a whimsical rover, a guise changer by your wish, a coequal 
of Terminator, but to whom you have gone and by whom you are led into this kind of plight. [3-19-5]

Shlok 6: "Who is that kind of highly intrepid warper, either from gods, or from celestials or from high-souled 
sages who indeed rendered you shapeless. [3-19-6]

Shlok 7: "Indeed, I do not find anyone who causes displeasure to me in this world, even among divinities including 
the thousand eyed Indra, the controller of demon Paaka. [3-19-7]

Shlok 8: "Now, I will take away the lives of that miscreant with my arrows that are terminators of lives, as 
a swan would drink milk to dregs even if it is mingled in water, duly separating milk from water. [3-19-8]

Shlok 9: "Whose frothy blood is it that the earth wishes to quaff when I cut off his crucial organs by my arrows 
and drop him dead in a combat. [3-19-9]

Shlok 10: "Whose body is it from which birds pressing round gladly wish to wring flesh to pieces for eating when 
I slay him in war. [3-19-10]

Shlok 11: "Now, when I haul him easily on the ground in a battle that villain will be unredeemable either by gods, 
celestials, evil spirits, or by demons. [3-19-11]

Shlok 12: "It will be apt of you to gather your sensitivity slowly and tell me as to which miscreant attacked 
and worsted you in the forest." Thus Khara spoke to Shuurpanakha. [3-19-12]

Shlok 13: On hearing this kind of words of her brother, especially who is rancorous, then Shuurpanakha spoke these 
words, tearfully. [3-19-13]

Shlok 14- 15: "Those two are in adulthood, good-looking, gentle yet greatly mighty, eyes broad like lotuses, dressed 
in jute-cloths and deerskin, subsistent on fruits and tubers, composed, sagacious and celibate, and 
they are the sons of Dasharatha, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [3-19-14,15]

[Commentary] Here, when asked by Khara 'who mutilated you?' Shuurpanakha should have normally reported that, 'sons 
of some king Dasharatha namely Rama and Lakshmana did this' But not telling so she starts her narration 
with an odd appreciation of Rama's aspects. Some of them are as below:



taruNau ruupa sampannau Though they scarred her on her nose and ears she did not loose her 
heart for them. This taruNau ruupa sampannau is in accordance with Rama's aspect which will 
be sadaiva priya darshanaH   'the same pleasant persona at any time' as in Bala Kanda at 1-1-16, 
as said by Sage Narada to Valmiki. This is the same situation with Hanuma when Seetha asks him to indicate 
some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts with raamaH kamala patra akshaH 
sarva sattva manoharaH - sundara 35-8. 'Rama is lotus-petal eyed one' Further people in sleep, 
intoxicated or infuriated conditions, will speak their heart supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j~naanam 
dR^iSTaH So Shuurpanakha who is also in a sleep like daze, she came out with her soulful feelings 
about Rama.



This narration has threefold meaning. 1] Through the eyes of a lustful female; 2] To belittle Rama and 
Lakshmana's prowess only to extol Kara's pride; 3] To deride Khara's valour so that he gets incited 
to fight Rama and Lakshmana.



taruNau 'came of age.' kanyaam varayate ruupam Women's first criterion towards a man 
is age. But this wording is in dwivacana 'in duel number' so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. 
Then the question comes 'is she leaning towards both of them?' Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she 
approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach 
Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per anyonya sadR^ishau viirau   'those darers 
are similar to one another.' Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers 
they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that 'this 
situation occurred due to both of them' as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, 
with 'either-or-single-or-both' syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with 
their glorious aspects, so far by her.



ruupa sampannau 'their aspects are ravishing' The syndrome is that angaat angaat sambhavasi 
'offshoots derive parent's aspects.' So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. 
Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is with niratishaya 
ruupa samR^iddhi   'sublime features, endowed with' that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha.



sukumaarau 'delicate' like flowers. Rama is said to equal a delicate flower. asiita puSpa 
samkaasham Rama's body itself is a flower that which can be cherished by all. Or su 
= excellent;
ku =of earth; maarau = Manmatha-s' 'two Manmatha-s on earth' Manmatha, is only one 
god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident 
on earth before eyes as per the attribute of kandarpa iva muurtimaan 'he has a form like that 
of Love-god'



Then her bother Khara may ask 'then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?' 
For that she says mahaa balau 'greatly vigorous.' They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, 
which is what required by an aged demoness.



puNDariika vishaala akshau 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' 'Their eyes are not like ours while our 
eyes are samrakta nayanaa ghoraa 'bloodshot eyes of terrible look'



Or, unlike tamo guNa udreka 'ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature' and unlike
rajo guNodreka 'ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature' -- their eyes are 
sattva guNa sampanna 'serene with the pure constituent of nature' Though Rama says that he 
aatmaanaam maanuSyam manye 'in my soul I consider I am human' but as per shruti / scripture,
yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii 'though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being, 
his eyes are telling the truth of His supernal nature', hence Rama is other-worldly.



Or his white broad eyes are comparable with kshiira samudra Milky-ocean, his abode, with its 
unfathomable depths, so is his heart.



Or mahaa balau puNDariika vishaala akshau 'Great mighty and white broad eyed ones' who by their 
great might annihilate vice and if the evildoer submits himself, their white eyes alone give salvation 
with a broad-mind. sukumaarau puNDariika vishaala akshau 'Manmatha-like, white, broad eyed'



If it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked 'where are the flowery arrows of that 
Love-god to these two?' But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The 
lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation 
in Lanka says that 'gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal 
eyed one' dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam 
raajiiva locanam || sundara 26-41. This verse takes its place in gayatri ramayaNa as its 
14th verse out of total 27 verses.



Further they are excelling only by their nature but not by their dressings and outfits for they are 
just clad in ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'jute-cloths, deerskin wearers of' Mahaakavi Kalidasa 
says in his abhij~naana shaakuntalam: says iyam [shakuntala] adhika manoj~naa valkalena api 
tanvii that, 'this Shakuntala is pleasant though clad in jute-cloths' kimavahi madhuraaNaam 
maNDananam na akR^itiinaam 'nothing can beautify beautiful people' etc. Though not adorned by any 
extra special ornamentation they by their nature are attractive, as discerned by sages at 3-1-13 of 
Aranya Kanda ruupa samhanam lakshmiim saukumaarya suveSatam as well by this Shuurpanakha or 
even by Ravana in part II of Yuddha Kanda, in 99th chapter 12th verse, who also extols these lotus eyes 
and the aspect of Rama on his first sight at Rama as padma patra vishaala aksham diirgha baahum 
arindamam



Should Khara ask in fear 'who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like 
me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.' Then Shuurpanakha's reply is like this, in 
order to remove Khara's fear of Rama:



taruNau  'youngsters, boys' for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these are
uuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaami in Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way 
tells Khara 'brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, ' Further
yauvane viSayaisiNaam 'boys in young age bother more for enjoymentÃ¯ -- they are bothered to 
enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them'



ruupa sampannau 'just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you'
kanyaa kaamayet ruupam 'girls cherish charming ones' 'They fall after girls only with their 
charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them'



sukumaarau 'delicate or fragile, or flimsy,' because they are sons of some king, grown up in 
palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us 
who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...'



mahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau   'very, without, strength; very weak fellows';



furthermore mahaa abalau; 
mahatii rakshaNiiyaa abalaa yayostu 'a lady, namely Seetha, is to be protected by them. She has 
become a string fastened around their necks. Then how do they, the sentinels of a woman, can fight you...'



puNDariika vishalaa akshau 'paled, broadened, eyed' 'Their eyes paled and wide-open awaiting 
the results of their scarring my nose and ears, and their eyes popped up in daze, then what can they 
do to you...'



Then Khara may ask, "it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up 
some army and fight me back then what?'



For this she says, ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'wearers 
of jute-cloths and deerskin' And furthering her argument she says, 'how can they afford an army for 
they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is 
begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile.  They themselves 
are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.'



Further, this god, say this 
Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, 
begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him.



Her words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara 
this way in order to enhance his self-pride.



tarunau; yauvane vijigiisuNaam 'youthful ones 
are interested in triumphs' 'Because they are the seekers of triumphs, they will definitely triumph 
over you, you better do not go there and get defeated'



ruupa sampannau; ruupyate anena; asaadhaaraNa niratishaya ruupa visheSatvaat 'with an unimaginable 
stance' They are known for their stance from their childhood in eliminating Tataka, Subaahu etc.,
gatvaa saumitri sahito naa vijitya ivartate 'on going with Lakshmana, he [Rama] does not return 
without conquering' yashasaH ca eka bhaajanam : Tara in Kishkindha, 14-20. 'for glory [Rama 
is] the only resort.' 'So many praises are said about them and hence they fight you out, better do not go'



If Khara asks, 'how can they fight me, such a mighty one?'



For this she says, sukumaarau 'they 
are dextrous' 'with their dexterity they easily eliminate you'



mahaa balau 'greatly mighty' 'Rama is mightily by his shoulder-strength' and also by the use 
of mahat shabda his might is by his tenacity of mind and ideation to eliminate foes. Or 
mahaa balau 'greatly sturdy.' Though he wars for a long his vigour does not deplete for he uses 
two vidya-s: bala, atibala 'by the twin principles taught by Vishvamitra his strength does 
not deplete.



puNDariika vishaala akshau 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' His broad white-lotus like eyes does 
neither contract in anger nor expand in exclamation, as usually happen to anyone who sees an object 
of interest with unnecessary widening of eyes priiti visphaarita iikshaNam



Next if it be asked 'are they ready for a fight' for which she says 'they are already clad in ciira 
kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'jute-cloth, deerskin, clad in' They have tightened their girdle-cloths and 
are armoured in shield like deerskin. Further they also have arrows and knives with which I am scarred 
so better not to go there and get your throat slit like my nose and ears, for you are a shameless, incapable 
demon still sitting here as I go on narrating the incident like a story'

Shlok 16: "Having all the aspects 
of kings they equal the kings of gandharva celestials, and I am ill-disposed to differentiate whether 
they two are gods or demons. [3-19-16]

[Commentary] Some mms have this daanavau 
demons as maanuSau, humans. While Khara, sending his demons to eliminate the brothers, says 
that they are just humans as at verse 22 in this chapter itself. So Shuurpanakha evasively told a lie 
to his brother that she could not distinguish between their own race and that of others. Khara for his 
part believes that neither demons nor gods can hurt his race.

Shlok 17: " I have seen a curvaceous 
lady between those two, a ripely beauty, rich in comeliness, adorned with lots of ornaments. [3-19-17]

[Commentary] She is baiting Khara with 
the beauty of Seetha. But this does not incite Khara like Ravana. She also plays the same card there 
with Ravana after the failure of this Khara and other brothers.

Shlok 18: "Owing to that woman I am 
led into this sort of situation, together by those two, as with an insecure female. [3-19-18]

[Commentary] The escapist words may be 
observed. She is not telling that she alone went to eat away Seetha, but she is holding Seetha responsible 
for all this and she is evasive to show any action of Seetha as the cause of trouble. She is simply 
twisting the episode towards her side.

Shlok 19: "Staying in the van of war 
I wish to drink the frothy blood of that guileful Seetha along with that of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, 
when they are killed in war. [3-19-19]

Shlok 20: "I shall drink her blood 
and also that of those two in war, this being my prime longing let it be fulfilled by you." Thus wailed 
Shuurpanakha before her brother Khara. [3-19-20]

Shlok 21: While she is saying like 
that Khara vengefully summoned fourteen great mighty demons that are similar to the Terminator. [3-19-21]

Shlok 22: "Wielding weapons and wearing 
jute-cloths and deerskin two humans have got into ghastly forest of Dandaka along with a woman of age." 
Thus Khara is ordering the fourteen demons. [3-19-22]

Shlok 23: "You shall return to me only on killing those two and also that 
treacherous woman, and their blood this sister of mine will drink. [3-19-23]

Shlok 24: "Oh, demons, on going there swiftly stamp them out by you own 
vigour, thus let the fanciful hearty desire of my sister be achieved. [3-19-24]

[Commentary] On these 23, 24 verses Maheshvara Tiirtha says: iyam bhaginii 
'this my sister' pramathya 'killing me' mama rudhiram paasyati 'my blood she drinks'
teSaam [samiipam gatvaa] to them, you nearing' sva tejasaa shiighreNa 'by your own 
valour, quickly' tau to them Rama and Lakshmana; dur vR^ittaam Seetha of impossible, 
behaviour [to be followed by others]; hatvaa; hana himsaa gatyoH knowing her: because hana 
indicates 'knowing also; so you know that Seetha, meaning 'be absolved by her' apaavartitum arhatha 
'return, you may' to heavens, as all these demons are celestials earlier to their curse.

Shlok 25: "On seeing your finishing those two brothers flatly in a war she 
this sister of mine will be gladdened, and then she drinks their blood in war, amusingly. [3-19-25]

[Commentary] This sister of mine would like to drink my blood. So you go to 
Rama and Lakshmana and then know that Seetha, who has an impossible behaviour. And be absolved by her 
for all of our sins. And then you may return. Not to Khara but their return is to heavens. The endnote 
may please be seen. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 26: In this way when Khara ordered those fourteen demons, they have 
gone to Panchavati along with Shuurpanakha like black-clouds glided by gales. [3-19-26]

Shlok 27: But then, though the nightwalker wielding sharp arrows have become 
ineffectual to trounce Rama like the wild elephants which will become ineffectual to overcome the blazingly 
uprising wildfire. [3-19-27]

[Commentary] This last verse is mismatching with the episode. This is not found 
in some publications of Gorakhpur versions but found in others and even in the Eastern recension. The 
import of this verse is that though the demons have gone to Rama but they could not assault him, which 
actually happens in next episode. However this verse is also included here as per the text of Chaukambha 
Vidyaa Bhavan, Ksashi, and according to Eastern recension.



Maheshvara Tiirtha notes 
that God Shiva cursed Khara and pardoned saying that he will be released from curse by Rama of Dasharatha.
tasmaadyaH 
kruura ruupeNa dehena harataa amR^itam | viShNur daasharathir bhuutvaa mokShayiShyati suvrata | 
In the sheSa dharma of Maha Bharata in the discourse between Bhiishma and Yudhistira it is 
said that sage Yajnavalkya has three sons. They are Chandrakanta, Mahaamedha and Vijaya. These three 
Brahmans became Khara, Duushana, and Trishira by the curse of Shiva. The first one Chandrakanta is Khara. 
And the disciples of the three Brahman scholars are fourteen and they also became Brahma-demons, who 
are now being sent. On listening Shuurpanakha Khara came to know that Vishnu arrived in the form of 
Rama and thus Khara wanted to get release from the curse by Rama, and hence firstly he sends the fourteen 
demon-disciples, and later he and his brother also follow the suit.



SARGA 20
------------------------------

[Text] The fourteen demons arrive at Rama's cottage guided by Shuurpanakha and they wage a war with Rama in 
which Rama destructs all their weaponry and eliminates them all. Seeing this defeat Shuurpanakha rushes 
back to her brother to report the defeat.

Shlok 1: Then on arriving at Raghava's hermitage that ghastly Shuurpanakha has shown the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, 
along with Seetha to the fourteen demons. [3-20-1]

Shlok 2: They have seen the great-mighty Rama seated in the thatched cottage along with Seetha and Lakshmana 
attending to him. [3-20-2]

Shlok 3: On seeing the arrival of the demons, and the demoness Shuurpanakha too, that magnificent Rama of Raghava 
dynasty said to the radiantly brilliant Lakshmana. [3-20-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, Soumitri, briefly tarry at the close of Seetha as I wish to eliminate these demons who have trailed 
the path of that demoness to here. [3-20-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing that word of Rama, then the nimble-souled Lakshmana honoured the word of Rama saying "so 
be it." [3-20-5]

Shlok 6: On taking up his awful bow that is decorated with gold Raghava stringed it with bowstring and even spoke 
the demons as a forewarning. [3-20-6]

Shlok 7: "We the sons of Dasharatha are brothers named Rama and Lakshmana, and we entered the impenetrable forests 
Dandaka along with Seetha. [3-20-7]

Shlok 8: "We the dispassionate subsist on fruits and tubers treading in the path of virtue, and we being the 
sages resident in Dandaka forest what for you outrage us. [3-20-8]

Shlok 9: "As assigned by the sages I chanced here with bow and arrows to decimate you evil-souled and unrighteous 
beings in a crucial clash. [3-20-9]

Shlok 10: "Stay there obligingly or you should not be able to return, else if you desire your lives, oh, nightwalkers, 
you may return now. [3-20-10]

Shlok 11- 12: On hearing that sentence of Rama they the fourteen ghoulish demons who are the slayers of Brahmans and 
handlers of spears have become highly infuriated, and they with their bloodshot eyes and with harsh 
words said these words to Rama, whose eyes are with blood streaks at their ends, and who also is a sweet 
talker, and whose valour is yet unseen by those fourteen demons. [3-20-11, 12]

Shlok 13: "Killed in conflict by us you alone will set your lives loose as an inciter of fury in our highly great 
souled lord Khara. [3-20-13]

Shlok 14: "Indeed, what capability you have as a lone one to stand against many of us in the forefront of war, 
and why tell again about your battling ability in a given battle. [3-20-14]

Shlok 15: "When we launch maces, spears and swords by our might you will forgo your lives, mettle, and even the 
bow now clasped in your hand." So said the demons to Rama. [3-20-15]

[Commentary] For the three verses the above meaning is the textual meaning. For them there is another import.



su mahaatmanaH oh, Supreme Person; bhartR^iH kharasya 
our lord, to Khara; krodham utpaadya anger, infusing; asmaabhiH hataH tvam praaNaan na 
haasyase eva by us, killed, you, Spirits, not, leaves, thus...



"Oh! Supreme Person, we have come here because you incited anger 
in our lord Khara, and by us killed will you let go your lives, mettle and spirits? No. Never it will 
happen."



The reason for not happening of that event is explained: raNa 
muurdhan in war's, van; ekasya te agrataH sthaatum lone one, you, before, to stand;
bahuunaam asmaakam api many, we are, though; kaa shaktiH where is, capability for 
us



"Though you are a lone being, and we are many, where is the capability 
for us to stand before you in the van of war?"



Thus they say that they have come only at the behest of their 
lord but not to kill Rama. baahuH yuktaiH parighaiH shuula paTTisaiH upalakshitaanaam though 
equipped with our paraphernalia like maces, spears, swords etc., adhyaahaara: asmaakam our;
praaNaan viiryam tyakshasi lives, vitality, we loose; ehi come... give us salvation.



"Though we are equipped with much paraphernalia like maces, spears, 
swords etc., we lose our lives and vitality at your hand, so come on, take them away, and accord salvation 
and release from our curse. It is better to die at your hand than returning to Khara and dying a merciless 
death at the hand of Khara.



It may be remembered that these fourteen are the cursed Vedic-scholarly 
disciples of Chandrakanta, now in an accursed form namely Khara and other demons. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 16- 17a: Thus saying that way clamorously they the fourteen demons, upraising their weapons they unhesitatingly 
rushed towards Rama alone, and they hurled lances towards that unconquerable Raghava. [3-20-16, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Rama in turn shredded all of those fourteen lances only with as many arrows that are adorned in gold. 
[3-20-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Next that great resplendent Rama in high wrath took up fourteen iron bolt like arrows that are whetted 
on whetstone and equalling the sun in their dazzle. [3-20-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Then Raghava took up his bow, arched it, and aiming at the targeted demons released arrows as Indra 
would release his Thunderbolts. [3-20-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: And by the force of their speed those arrows gored the chests of those demons, and then on coming out 
bedaubed with blood they swiftly penetrated into earth like snakes into snake pit. [3-20-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: Those arrows bursting their hearts they are blood bathed, mangled, and utterly dead, and like the uprooted 
trees they fell onto the ground. [3-20-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22: On seeing the demons falling onto ground that demoness Shuurpanakha is convulsed in rage, and she with 
a blanched aspect returned to the near of Khara in an agonising manner like a creeper exuding resin 
on incision, and fell before him as before. [3-20-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: Then she in the presence of her brother Khara discharged a great outcry, and with a bloodless face she 
spilled tears attuning the strains of a whiner. [3-20-24]

Shlok 25: Shuurpanakha having seen the fall of demons quickly fled from Panchavati of Rama to trikanTaka, the 
capital of Khara, and she being the sister of Khara she reported to Khara all about the destruction 
of those demons, in its entirety. [3-20-25]



SARGA 21
------------------------------

[Text] Shuurpanakha comes again to her brother Khara to report that all the fourteen demons sent by him are 
slain by Rama. She persuades him to wage a war against Rama and Lakshmana and annihilate them for they 
intruded into Dandaka and there is every possibility of onslaught by them on demons.

Shlok 1: On seeing Shuurpanakha who came back only to wreck havoc on demonic race and again fell before him as 
before, Khara spoke this sentence to her in clear terms in all his fury. [3-21-1]

Shlok 2: "What for your are howling again when I have just now commanded those fearless flesh eating demons in 
order to fulfill your wish? [3-21-2]

Shlok 3: "Those demons are my admirers, adherers and they always remained my well-wishers, hence there is no 
question of their non-accomplishment of my orders. [3-21-3]

Shlok 4: "Owing to what you are highly bawling by saying, 'haa, lord' and wriggle on the ground like a snake? 
I would like to know the reason for all this, what is it? [3-21-4]

Shlok 5: "I am here to take care of you, then why should you really cry out like an uncared-for being, get up...get 
up, and ward off this sort of perplexity." Thus Khara said to Shuurpanakha. [3-21-5]

Shlok 6: She that Shuurpanakha who is otherwise an unassuageable one is wholly pacified when Khara spoke to her 
thus that way, and she on dabbing her tearful eyes then spoke to her brother Khara. [3-21-6]

Shlok 7: "I came to you just a while back with my ears and nose chopped off and wet with gushes of blood, and 
you too have comforted me, isn't it. [3-21-7]

Shlok 8: "Oh, valiant brother, for my delight you too have sent fourteen demons to eliminate that atrocious Rama 
along with Lakshmana, isn't it? [3-21-8]

Shlok 9: "But they all who handled their spears and bolts along with an envious anger are killed in a fight with 
Rama by his arrows that cleave the crucial parts of his opponents. [3-21-9]

Shlok 10: "On seeing those highly impetuous demons falling to earth in a trice, and even on seeing the unusual 
deed of Rama in felling them, I am highly alarmed. [3-21-10]

Shlok 11: "Oh me! I am alarmed, fully frenzied, and even despaired, oh, nightwalker Khara, and beholding dread 
everywhere again I have come seeking your refuge. [3-21-11]

Shlok 12: "Why do not you rescue me when I am drowned in a vast ocean called grief, wherein each pervasive crocodile 
is despair and each swelling wave is fright. [3-21-12]

Shlok 13: "Besides, those flesh-eating demons that have followed me are also felled by Rama with his sharp arrows, 
for whom I have a contrite heart. [3-21-13]

Shlok 14- 15a: "If you have mercy on me, and even on those dead demons, and if ability and animation are still left 
in you to cope with Rama, oh, nightwalker, kill that Rama who is a thorn in the side of demons dwelling 
in Dandaka forest. [3-21-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, I will give up my life unhesitatingly, 
that too in your fore, that too now itself.



If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, now itself I will give up my life 
than living a shameless life with these lopped ears and nose. [3-21-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17: "I can perceive instinctually that you are incapable of affronting Rama in a given crucial battle, even 
if your are with all your forces on the battlefield, and you assert yourself a valiant, but you are 
just vainglorious. [3-21-16b, 17]

Shlok 18- 19: "Kill those two, Rama and Lakshmana, as they are just humans, or else, if you are incapable of doing 
so, really what for is your stay here in Janasthaana with your trivial stamina and trifling sinews like 
a stupid blemishing his clan, then get out of this Janasthaana at once along with your hench-demons. 
[3-21-18, 19]

[Commentary] The order of the verses from 16 to the last varies with versions and verbatim meanings differ. This 
is a kind of intimidation Shuurpanakha hurling at Khara. Besides being her brothers, Khara, Trishira 
and Duushana are the provincial governors of Janasthaana, nominated by Ravana. If they do not come to 
the rescue of Shuurpanakha, or to that matter of fact should they not eliminate intruders into Janasthaana, 
there is every possibility of their ouster from their posts by Ravana, because Shuurpanakha has more 
access to Ravana.

Shlok 20: "You will completely and quickly evanish, indeed, subjugated by resplendence of Rama, for that Dasharatha's 
son Rama possess that kind of resplendence, in effect. [3-21-20]

Shlok 21- 22: "And, by whom I am misshapen that brother of Rama too is a highly vigorous one..." in this way on saying 
Shuurpanakha bawled variously in the presence of her brother, Khara, and then anguished by her own affliction 
that demoness with a cave like belly started hitting her paunch with both of her hands, and what is 
more, she swooned. [3-21-21, 22]

[Commentary] The name Khara also stands for a he-ass



SARGA 22
------------------------------

[Text] Khara, the brother of Shuurpanakha starts out to wage war with Rama with fourteen thousand demons and 
with their unusual arsenal. This is the first major move of demons towards Rama that leads to the ultimate 
battle at the end of epic.

Shlok 1: Thus when Shuurpanakha disparaged that valiant Khara amidst demons he is infuriated and spoke these 
highly hurtful words. [3-22-1]

Shlok 2: "This fury of mine originating from the disgrace brought on you is like the highly bitter salt water 
that is impossible to contain when ingested. [3-22-2]

Shlok 3: "I do not care the valour of that Rama for he is a human with dwindled lifetime, now going to give up 
his life slain by his own misdoings. [3-22-3]

Shlok 4: "Control your tears and cast off your despair too, for I will send Rama to the abode of the Terminator 
along with his brother. [3-22-4]

Shlok 5: "Now, you demoness, you will swill that Rama's red hot blood when that short-lived one is hewed down 
to earth with an axe." So Khara assured Shuurpanakha. [3-22-5]

Shlok 6: On hearing the words plunged from the mouth of Khara she is very much gladdened and in all her stupidity 
she further praised her brother highly saying, "you are the best among all the demons..." [3-22-6]

Shlok 7: Though she denounced him earlier she alone praised him now for which Khara is overjoyed, and then he 
ordered his army commander, namely Duushana. [3-22-7]

Shlok 8: "Those who are the followers of my will, whose hustle will be frightful and who will be unretreating 
in combats, such of those demons are there in fourteen thousand numbers, aren't they. [3-22-8]

Shlok 8: "And oh, gentle Duushana, those domineering demons are with dark-clouds like complexions, and they are 
the pamperers of genocide, as such, cause them for a belligerency, all at once. [3-22-9]

[Commentary] The very sight of these black cloud like demons will be murderous to humans, as Rama exclaimed about 
Tataka. If the on looking humans are not dead at first sight of these demons, then these demons can 
pamper in killing humans

Shlok 10: "For me, oh, gentle one, promptly position my chariot before me along with bows and arrows, amazing 
swords and diverse sharp power bolts. [3-22-10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, war pert Duushana, I wish to start ahead of all the demons of ours, who are the clans-demons of 
the great souled Paulastya, for the purpose of elimination of that evil-minded Rama." So said Khara 
to Duushana. [3-22-11]

[Commentary] For this Maheshvara Tiirtha says: raamasya 
agre paulastyaanaam raakShasaanaam vadhaartham niryaatum icchaami which gives meaning: 
"Before Rama I wish to present all the demonic clansmen of Sage Paulastya, for the purpose of elimination, 
for which I am starting ahead as a starter of this elimination process..."

Shlok 12: While Khara is saying thus Duushana heralded saying, "Here comes the great chariot with sun's dazzle, 
yoked with very good horses of variegated colours." [3-22-12]

Shlok 13- 14- 15: That chariot which has a roomy cabin with its rooftop like that of the ridge of Mt. Meru, body embellished 
in gold, wheels golden, gem-studded yoke-to-carriage shaft, all around encompassed with golden artefacts 
like fishes, flowers, trees, mountains, sun, moon, and auspicious birds flocks and stars, and even decorated 
with jingle-bells, endowed with flags, swords, and best horses, and such as it is, Khara embarked on 
it with all his rancour. [3-22-13, 14, 15]

Shlok 16: On overseeing that great army with chariots, skins shields, weaponry and flags, and even at Duushana 
too, Khara charged all those demons saying "proceed." [3-22-16]

Shlok 17: Then that demonic force with their ghoulish skin shields, weaponry and flags, issued forth from Janasthaana, 
blaring blatantly and foraying dashingly. [3-22-17]

Shlok 18: Wielding maces, dart-bolts, and spears, and also razor-sharp axes, swords and discs, and dreadful power-darts 
and power-bolts that are flashing, iron maces, unusual bows, clubs, scimitars and pounding-shafts, and 
even thunderbolt like weapons that are calamitous in look, that army which comprises fourteen thousand 
fiendish demons that are the followers of Khara's whim, has started from Janasthaana. [3-22-18, 19, 
20]

[Commentary] Earlier batch which was sent against Rama consisted fourteen demons and now it is an army of fourteen 
thousand demons.

Shlok 21: On seeing the outrush of those demons of diabolic appearance, then Khara's chariot also proceeded a 
little later at their behind. [3-22-21]

Shlok 22: Then the charioteer set spurs on those colourful horses that are adorned in polished gold according 
to the notions of Khara. [3-22-22]

Shlok 23: When the chariot of enemy destroyer Khara is driven that impetuously, it has started to swell earth's 
four cardinal quarters and inter-quarters with turbulence. [3-22-23]

Shlok 24: He whose voice is thunderous and whose rancour escalated speedily, and who is hastening forward like 
the Terminator intending to destroy his enemy, that Khara repeatedly hurried the charioteer shouting 
at him loudly like a overwhelming cloud that is going to storm stones. [3-22-24]



SARGA 23
------------------------------

[Text] On the starting out of Khara's demonic forces to wage a war with Rama, many bad omens are foreboded 
by vultures, animals, and even by nature. Though in the know of the portent evil, Khara proceeds with 
his army vaingloriously messaging his army that he can overcome these auguries or even Indra, and Rama 
is nothing before him.

Shlok 1: A massy and tumultuous ass-coloured cloud rained ill-omened bloody water while that fiendish force is 
advancing. [3-23-1]

Shlok 2: The highly speedy horses paired to Khara's chariot have tottered in a trice, even though that place 
on the highway is with even surface and spread with flowers. [3-23-2]

Shlok 3: Capturing the sun a blackish corona with blood-red outer circle has formed and nested around it 
like the fiery ring formed by circling a fireball. [3-23-3]

[Commentary] This sort of corona can be seen during the total eclipse of sun where a black corona with red tinged 
glow forms around the eclipsed sun. This circling of fireball handheld on a sling is there even today, 
and it is performed before marriage processions or such other events as a daring sport.

Shlok 4: Then, nearing the golden shaft of the flag of the chariot with a very lofty flagstaff, an awful eagle 
with massive body occupied and perched atop of that golden shaft. [3-23-4]

Shlok 5: Cacophonous and carnivorous predators and vultures took over the nearby places of Janasthaana and they 
made raucous sounds of many kinds. [3-23-5]

Shlok 6: Turning towards the stretch scorched by the sun, fearsome and loud noised jackals have howled emitting 
awful sounds, that which is inauspicious to the demons. [3-23-6]

Shlok 7: Then frightening clouds similar to bursting mountains carrying bloodlike water have rendered the firmament 
less of leeway. [3-23-7]

Shlok 8: There chanced an abominable, cataclysmic, hair-raising darkness whereby the milieus or inter-milieus 
are not very clearly brightened. [3-23-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: An untimely eventide glistened with a colour similar to the one drenched in blood, and then horrendous 
brutes and birds have clamoured facing Khara directly, and the vultures, jackals and eagles too have 
screamed portending danger. [3-23-9, 10a]

Shlok 10: Jackals, that too female jackals, are always the agents of inauspiciousness in wars with demonstrable 
calamities brought forth by their portending howling, and such jackals have now howled in front of Khara's 
army with their snouts spewing blazes. [3-23-10]

Shlok 11b- 12: A spherical object like that of a human trunk is revealed near at the sun, while the sun is rendered 
shineless as though Rahu, the great eclipsing-planet, has eclipsed him inopportunely, and the wind too 
whirled frantically. [3-23-11b, 12]

Shlok 13- 14a: Stars sprang up with the brilliance of fireflies though it is not night, and at that moment fishes and 
waterfowls stood still in lakes, lotuses have dried up, flowers and fruits have dropped from trees as 
though it is night. [3-23-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Without any puffing of wind dust in brownish-red colour is heaved up, and there the songbirds like Maina 
started to twitter as 'cii cii kuu cii'. [3-23-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] The expression cii cii kuu cii is an onomatopoetic expression for the twittering of birds.

Shlok 15b- 16a: Meteors horrible in their look have fallen down thunderously, and even the earth together with its mountains, 
woods and forests quaked shakily. [3-23-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: He who is raving while sitting in his chariot that clever Khara's left shoulder thrilled excessively, 
and his voice too quavered. [3-23-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: While he is seeing everywhere his eyes spawned tears for no good reason, his forehead ached, but he 
did not retrace his steps owing to his own vanity. [3-23-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: On observing those worst auguries stemming up at that moment with hair-raising nature, Khara laughed 
them off and said this to all of the demons. [3-23-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "These awful auguries with their horrible nature have arisen, but owing to my own valour I am unbothered 
about all of them as with a mighty one unworried of the mightless. [3-23-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "With the excruciating arrows of mine I can hurtle stars from the face of sky, and if highly infuriated, 
I can even enjoin mortality to Death himself. [3-23-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: "I am reluctant to return without killing that Rama, a haughty one by his might, together with his brother 
Lakshmana, with my incisive arrows. [3-23-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "In whose respect both Rama and Lakshmana behaved perversely, let that sister of mine be contented in 
drinking the blood of those two. [3-23-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "No defeat has chanced on me in combats at anytime and anywhere, that to you all is obvious and I tell 
no untruth. [3-23-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "If I am infuriated I can eliminate even the king of gods, wielder of Thunderbolt and a trekker on ruttish 
elephant Iravata, namely Indra in a war, then why talk about these two humans." Thus Khara addressed 
his troops. [3-23-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: On hearing that thundering speech of Khara that sizeable army of demons which is tied down by the noose 
of death obtained an incomparable rejoice. [3-23-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Then desiring to see the war of Khara with Rama, great-souls like sages, gods, gandharva-s along with 
carana-s and siddha-s have come together in firmament. [3-23-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: On gathering at a place those great souls met one another and said, "let good betide cows, Brahmans 
and those that are held respectful by the people at large." [3-23-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28: "Let Raghava triumph over these mighty night walkers from the lineage of Pulastya, as with Vishnu who 
once conquered all the mighty demons in war." So said celestials to one another. [3-23-28]

Shlok 29: While the great sages are speaking about this and many other topics, they and the gods abiding in their 
aircrafts have inquisitively seen the flow of army of demons, whose longevity is now beyond hope. [3-23-29, 
30]

Shlok 31: Khara speedily bolted in his chariot to the van of his legions, and on seeing that demon Khara going 
in front other important demons too rushed to fore. They are Shyenagaami, Prithugviira, Yajnashatru, 
Vihamgama and also Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, 
Rudhiraaksha. These twelve highly valorous demons cruised in a semicircle around Khara. [3-23-31]

Shlok 33: Likewsie Mahakapaala, Stuulaaksha, Pramaathii, Trishira are the four commanders of demonic forces and 
they followed Duushana marching at his behind. [3-23-33]

Shlok 34: That army of valiant demons which is highly execrable, infernally speedy, and readily inspirited for 
a battle quickly rushed towards those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, as though a festoon of planets 
would rush towards the Moon and Sun so as to put them to rout. [3-23-34]



SARGA 24
------------------------------

[Text] Rama perceives good omens of victory, but to safeguard Seetha he sends her away with Lakshmana to take 
shelter in a mountain's cave till the war is over. Then he adopts a furious nature to annihilate demons. 
Gods and divinities watch from heavens as to how a war can occur between one against fourteen thousand 
demons.

Shlok 1: While fiercely valorous Khara proceeded towards Rama's hermitage, Rama along with his brother Lakshmana 
has indeed seen the very same auguries which have earlier appeared to Khara. [3-24-1]

Shlok 2: On looking at those very gruesomely bad omens, and perceiving them to be unpropitious to people, Rama 
spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [3-24-2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, dextrous Lakshmana, for the complete elimination of all the demons these great indications have 
arisen, as though betokening the annihilation of all beings. See them. [3-24-3]

Shlok 4: "On their part these clouds are hovering on the sky with stark reddish-grey tint, thunderously braying 
and copiously showering streams of blood. [3-24-4]

Shlok 5: "All my arrows too are incensed to fuming in an ecstasy towards a war, and dorsally gold-plated bows 
of mine are incessantly spurring to hook up those arrows, telling apart the impeding conflict. [3-24-5]

Shlok 6: "Judging by the kind of wild birds that are shrieking here, danger is up ahead and coming upon us, along 
with uncertainty of our lives. [3-24-6]

Shlok 7- 8: "This right hand of mine is indicating by its repeated throbbing that a critical and riotous conflict 
is going to occur, no doubt, but oh brave one, our victory and defeat to the enemies are also in vicinity, 
and for sure, your face is also appearing brightish and aglow, which itself is a good omen. [3-24-8] 
[3-24-7, 8]

Shlok 9: "If the faces of those that are poised for a conflict loose lustre, deem that the death is looming large 
on their longevity too. [3-24-9]

Shlok 10: "This nasty noise which we hear pertains to the uproar of demons, and even to the drumming of war drums 
by the demons of fiendish activities, and this is ear-splitting. [3-24-10]

Shlok 11: "Preventive measures are to be effectuated for any imminent situation by any well-wishing person, or 
by a person with misgivings about a danger, or by a person of talent. [3-24-11]

[Commentary] The meaning can otherwise be rendered as: 'If any misgivings are caused by an imminent danger a well-wisher 
and intellectual person shall effectuate preventive measures...' but this becomes more self-centred 
and cannot become a maxim or axiom.

Shlok 12: "Hence, wield your bow, keep arrows ready at hand, and taking Vaidehi with you seek shelter in a impassable 
cave of a mountain overgrown with trees. [3-24-12]

Shlok 13: "I wish you to gainsay me for this word of mine, my boy, have honour on my feet and be gone not before 
long. [3-24-13]

Shlok 14: "You are a stalwart, a forceful one, and for sure you can eliminate them all, it is doubtless, but I 
long to eliminate all of the nightwalkers, personally" Rama said thus to Lakshmana. [3-24-14]

Shlok 15: When Rama said to him that way, Lakshmana picked up his bow and arrows, and together with Seetha he 
took shelter in an unreachable cave. [3-24-15]

[Commentary] This episode of sending away Seetha and Lakshmana has got three reasons in the complex of She-He-Me. 
1] One is that this Seetha is to be sent away from that prospective battlefield, because Seetha is untrained 
for warfare like Rama's third mother Kaikeyi. Secondly, whenever Seetha is present we see no killings 
or slayings in Ramayana, because she, as Goddess Lakshmi, condones any sinner and accords salvation. 
As such, there may be a probability of not only hindering war, but there may be her blessing to every 
demon with a free passage to heaven, of which Rama becomes a helpless onlooker. 2] Second reason is 
that this Lakshmana is intolerant of any assault on his brother or sister-in-law and colloids head-on 
with the aggressors, which may lead Lakshmana up to Lanka to confront even Ravana. That being the snakily 
aggressive nature of Lakshmana, Rama bids him to go away before any happening, or any further dialogue 
is given to Lakshmana. 3] Third is that Rama is the first one to promise the sages and saints to eradicate 
demons for himself, for which Seetha nags him not to wage a causeless war. Therefore, if Rama is going 
to hide in any cave camouflaged by trees along with Seetha, and Lakshmana goes on warring, the very 
character of Rama is at stake. Thus, as promised to sages and saints Rama alone wanted to trigger off 
the elimination process of demons. That is why Rama breathes fresh air saying "good riddance" in next 
verse.

Shlok 16: On Lakshmana's entering into cave along with Seetha, Rama said to himself, "thank goodness, it is a 
good-idea!" and thus saying he donned his shield. [3-24-16]

Shlok 17: Well bedecked in a shield that has fire-like brilliance that Rama shone forth like a fumeless conflagration 
up-shot in utter darkness. [3-24-17]

Shlok 18: On raising his imposing bow and drawing arrows, that valorous Rama firmed up and stood there, filling 
all the directions with the tinny sounds of bowstring. [3-24-18]

Shlok 19: Gods with gandharva-s and great-souled siddha-s along with carana-s have then met one another and came 
there aspiring to see the war. [3-24-19]

Shlok 20: The great-souled sages and those that are known in worlds as eminent Brahma-sages, on their coming together 
those beings of pious exploits spoke to one another, among themselves. [3-24-20]

Shlok 21- 22a: "Let good betide cows, Brahmans and those people that are abiding in all the worlds. Raghava shall be 
victorious in the war over the clansmen of Sage Paulastya, the nightwalkers." Thus they talked among 
themselves. [3-24-21]

Shlok 22b- 23: Thus speaking they also well-said again, looking at each other "the demons of fiendish deeds are fourteen 
thousand in number and this virtue-souled Rama is solitary... what would be the result of this war!" 
Thus the sages discussed among themselves. [3-24-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: Thus the assemblages of kingly-sages, siddha-s and the eminent Brahmans, along with gods that are staying 
in their aircrafts, tarried there in the firmament peering inquisitively at Rama. [3-24-24]

Shlok 25: Immured in an aura of invincibility Rama is standing up to the war in its vanguard, and then on seeing 
at him all beings went into the throes of dread. [3-24-25]

Shlok 26: That nonesuch aspect of Rama whose deeds are unharmful to any, has become the aspect of wrathful supreme-souled 
Rudra. [3-24-26]

[Commentary] The wrathful aspect of Rudra at the time of era ending has chanced on Rama to start the elimination 
of demonic clan and this is as observed by caaraNaa-s in firmament. caaraNaa-s are 
those divine beings that journey in heavens in their auspicious paths. Hanuma while jumping the ocean 
to Lanka treads the path of caaraNaa-s because their footpath is so auspicious. For this
skaanda puraaNa has something to tell: rudra tejo 
vilasitam dR^iShTvaa raama kalebaram | sa~Nkham cakra shuulam ca pinaakam kheTam eva ca | khaTvaam ca 
ghanTaam Damaru baaNa paasha ankusham tathaa | caapam vajram khaDgam ca parashum traasa kaaraNam | jaya 
shriyam ca gangaam ca dadR^ishuH siddha caaraNaaH | skaandda puraaNa According to Maheshvara 
Tiirtha.

Shlok 27- 28- 29: While gods, gandharva-s, carana-s are conversing thus, then they have seen there the legions of the 
demons arriving from all over with boisterous noises, spouting cries of bravo, handling their grisly 
skins, shields, weaponry and war-flags, and onrushing at each other in disarray. With brassy twanging 
of bows, with the drumming of war drums, and even by their jumping, leaping and bouncing that area is 
filled with very loud and clamorous noise. [3-24-27, 28, 29]

Shlok 30- 31a: When highly brutish cacophony of demons started to fill the forest, that jangling even panicked the 
brutes ranging in that forest, and those beasts dashed off to other places where silence prevailed, 
without looking back. [3-24-30, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: And that foolhardy army of demons which in simile is like an unnavigable ocean steered towards Rama 
handling many assault weapons. [3-24-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: Casting his sight all-over even that war-expert Rama has seen that army of Khara lunging at a conflict. 
[3-24-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33: Rama stretched his awesome bow to examine the taut of bowstring, and even whipped arrows out of quiver, 
and then adopted a mask of extreme wrath to eliminate all the demons. [3-24-33]

[Commentary] Rama has no built-in feature of ire or wrath. He has to whip it up at times to show divine fury as a 
mask. From the start Vishnu is changing get-ups and when Milky Ocean was churned, He became Mohini, 
and from then on his role-play is continuous in al the incarnations. As said in Bala Kanda 1-1-18:
kaalaagni sadR^ishaH krodhe 'resembles like fierce fire in anger...' thus it is a resemblance, 
not an actuality, even that is unbearable for a glance.
atha yuddha 
samudyata yaatudhaanaanidhaanaaya satvaram udagra kopam aaviShTasya pracaNDa anila dodhuuyamaana jvaalaakalaapa 
yugaanta anala kalpasya sakala jana duShprekShyasya - - dharmaakuutam Even now, on seeing 
Rama's unsightly aspect, should these demons fall prostrate before him, there would no loss to their 
lives. But Khara, as his name itself indicates that he has an asinine mentality, will not yield.

Shlok 34: And when he is enraged and blazing he became frightful-looking like the blazing Fire at the end of era, 
and on seeing such a Rama when he is pervaded with conflagration like anger, the pastoral deities are 
very much annoyed. [3-24-34]

Shlok 35: The all-pacific aspect of that Rama then in his exasperation appeared to be like that of the all-ruinous 
Rudra, the wielder of bow called Pinaki, namely peaceful Shiva when enraged, at the time of Rudra's 
embarking on to ruin the Vedic ritual of Daksha Prajaapati. [3-24-35]

Shlok 36: That army of raw-flesh eaters with their bows, embellishments, and chariots, and also with their armours, 
all glittering with the dazzle of flaming fire, varied into a sky-blue coloured cluster of clouds on 
which the dazzling sunrays will be glittering at the dawning of the sun. [3-24-36]

[Commentary] The metaphor of cloud-clusters with the demons is to explain that the clouds will evaporate on the advent 
of fire-like sun at his dawn or rising of Rama to war. The night-walking demons have their powers increased 
in evening times and dwindled in morning. Thus their fire-like armours will cease to exist when the 
real Sun's fire [or fire of Rama's arrows] starts to flame, their bows cease to exits if the rainbow-giver 
comes in, and their flagging ensigns will cease with the ensigncy of raising sun in sky, and ill becomes 
of them, the evil-doers, after a short while.



SARGA 25
------------------------------

[Text] The ambidextrous archery of Rama is established here for the first time. So far, he has been using his 
archery sporadically, and here it is said to have a different dimension. The speed with which he draws 
arrows from quiver, the quickness with which he strings them, and the precision with which he shoots, 
is suggested here, though not explained. Though no apparent divinity is attached to this excercise, 
it suggests a divine expertise of a human.



There are fourteen thousand demons against one Rama, and the Divine beings watch this from heavens as 
a sport, without according any miraculous powers to Rama, suggesting that a human has to face any number 
of problems, here fourteen thousand demons, for himself and no divine grace suddenly comes to his help.



Rama gives the demons enough time and warning, but as the atrocity is escalating, he uses one gandharva 
missile and many other arrows, which will devastate the entire army of Dushana's brute force.

Shlok 1: Khara on arriving at the hermitage along with forerunning soldiers saw the enemy-eliminator and wrathful 
Rama holding fast to his bow. [3-25-1]

Shlok 2: On seeing Rama that bawling Khara raised his string-taut bow that makes an ass-like braying twang, drove 
his charioteer crazy saying, "drive to the fore of that Rama..." [3-25-2]

Shlok 3: On the orders of Khara the charioteer drove the horses to there where the mighty armed Rama is standing 
single-handedly while swaying his bow. [3-25-3]

Shlok 4: On seeing Khara descending on Rama then all those nightwalkers who are the deputies of Khara encircled 
Khara venting out loud battle cries. [3-25-4]

Shlok 5: Khara staying on his chariot in the thick of those demons appeared to be like coppery-red planet Mars 
up-shot in the thick of stars. [3-25-5]

Shlok 6: In his proneness to war then Khara assaulted that uniquely forceful Rama with a thousand arrows and 
blared a roaring battle cry. [3-25-6]

Shlok 7: All of those infuriated nightwalkers then incessantly rained diverse weapons on that invincibleRama 
who is handling a horrific bow. [3-25-7]

Shlok 8: Those demons that are already caught up with rancour bombarded Rama with bludgeons, lances, tridents, 
darts and hatchets. [3-25-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: Those massive bodied and exceptionally mighty demons came jostling like immense clouds in their eagerness 
to kill Rama in that war, while some mounted on chariots and horsebacks, and some more riding mountain-ridges 
like elephants rushed in on Rama. [3-25-9,10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: And those bands of demons have outpoured arrows on Rama, as with enormous black-clouds disemboguing 
torrents on a lofty mountain. [3-25-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: When hemmed in with those grisly-looking demons Rama appeared like Rudra surrounded by his divine retinue 
called prathama gaNa-s, on certain days, whereupon he starts his all-destructive 
cosmic-dance. [3-25-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: That Raghava has pre-empted those arrows discharged by the demons with his excruciatingly pointed arrows 
as an ocean would do with the river's onrush. [3-25-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Even if his body is gashed with those gruesome assault weapons Rama is not enfeebled, as with the enormous 
Mt. Meru that can withstand even if battered by very many highly blazing thunderbolts of Indra. [3-25-13, 
14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Bruised and bedaubed with blood on all his limbs that Rama of Raghu's dynasty took shape of the sun 
enshrouded by cloudscapes at eventide. [3-25-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] Rama is not fading away like the evening sun but becoming more like blood red sun. The 'covering of 
blood' on his limbs suggests the covering of reddish flaring fire on all his limbs, as we say that evening 
sun is stained with blood and fire.

Shlok 15b- 16a: On seeing lone Rama beset by many demons, then the gods, celestials, saints and sublime-sages are dispirited. 
[3-25-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: But Rama on becoming highly infuriated curved his bow to a full circularity on stretching the bowstring 
up to his ear, and then jetted out trenchant arrows in hundreds. Why hundreds? He surged them in thousands. 
[3-25-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: In that war Rama sportily discharged eagle-feathered arrows adorned in gold which are unstoppable and 
intolerable, and which in simile are the leads of Time-god. [3-25-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Those arrows that are playfully discharged on the army of enemy have grabbed the lives of demons like 
the tethers flung by the Time-god. [3-25-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: On impaling the bodies demons, the arrows swamped in blood have gone into welkin, where they are aglow 
with flares equalling inflamed flames. [3-25-19b, 20a]

[Commentary] The similitude between redness of blood and the redness of flaring fire is again suggested, as said 
at 3-25-14b, 15a above.

Shlok 20b- 21a: Innumerable and highly frightening arrows fusilladed from the nimbus of the bow of Rama that resulted 
as the filchers of the lives of demons. [3-25-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: In that war, shooting now with hundreds, and now with thousands of such arrows, Rama shredded those 
many bows, pinnacles of war-flags, armours and the like. And even shred are the heads of demons, along 
with their ornamented arms and thighs similar to the trunks of elephants. [3-25-21b, 22]

Shlok 23- 24: With the arrows flung from the bow-bowstring-nimbus of Rama, he indeed shredded and scraped the horses 
hitched with golden harnesses, and the chariots to which they are yoked, and even their charioteers. 
Likewise, he even ripped off the elephants along with their riders, and the horses along with their 
cavaliers. And on eliminating infantrymen in that war Rama led them to the abode of Yama, the Time-god. 
[3-25-23, 24] [3-25-23]

Shlok 25: While ripped to pieces with tubular arrows, with arrows made of iron, and with sharp-edged and crescent-tipped 
arrows those demons have let out disgusting cries of anguish. [3-25-25]

Shlok 26: When those arrows that gore the critical parts are thus harrowing, that army is discomposed like a forest 
burnt to a cinder by wild-fire. [3-25-26]

Shlok 27: Some of the grotesquely sinewy and braving nightwalkers are highly enraged and dashed their darts, tridents, 
and hatchets towards Rama. [3-25-27]

Shlok 28: On fending off those weapons with his arrows that mighty armed and valorous Rama filched away their 
lives by shearing off their necks in that war. [3-25-28]

Shlok 29: Those demons crashed down to earth with their heads severed and shields and bows wrecked, like the trees 
strewn around on earth owing to the gust raised by Garuda, the Divine Eagle, when he takes a sudden 
flight in heavens. [3-25-29]

Shlok 30: Those nightwalkers that are battered by those arrows and remaining there, they desperately rushed towards 
Khara alone seeking shelter. [3-25-30]

Shlok 31: Comforting all of them and taking his bow, very highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards that infuriated 
Rama like the furious Eliminator Yama.



That highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards Rama as highly infuriated Yama rushes towards Rudra, 
where Rudra being the ultimate eliminator himself, angry rush of Yama towards Rudra is therefore futile. 
[3-25-31]

[Commentary] The second meaning can be expressed by substituting the word 'kruddha' with 'rudra' as in other mms 
than that of Gorakhpur version.

Shlok 32: Coming under the shelter of Duushana all of those demons are but emboldened and returned, and they once 
again rushed towards Rama with saala trees, palm trees and boulders as their weapons. [3-25-32]

Shlok 33- 34a: Handling tridents, maces, and leashes those great-mighty demons have created torrents of arrows, missiles, 
trees and boulders, and inundated Rama in that war. [3-25-33, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: Again there chanced a highly gruesome war between Rama and those demons that is tumultuous, stunning, 
and a hair-raising. [3-25-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b- 36- 37: Those demons have resurfaced from all around pressurising Raghava in high dudgeon. On seeing the reappearance 
of demons from everywhere, with whom all the directions and inter-directions are fully filled, and who 
are storming torrents of arrows, then that exceptionally forceful Rama made a thunderous sound and launched 
an extremely blazing missile among the gather of demons, called gandharva missile. [3-25-35b, 36, 37]

Shlok 38: Then from the nimbus of his bow, arrows in thousand have scurried out, and with them thus arrived all 
the ten sides are cramped up. [3-25-38]

Shlok 39: Either the drawing of those supreme arrows from the quiver, or the traction of bowstring on placing 
them, or unloosing them from the bow is unperceived by those demons that are harrowing under those arrows. 
[3-25-39]

Shlok 40: Darkness caused by the thick of the arrows overspread the sky including its sun, while Rama happened 
to persevere spewing forth his arrows. [3-25-40]

[Commentary] Dark grew the air with arrowy hail / Which hid the sun as with a veil. - Griffith.

Shlok 41: Far and wide the earth is scattered with herds that are falling instantaneously, hosts that have fallen 
instantly, and huddles that are already felled with an instantaneity. [3-25-41]

[Commentary] Fiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain, / All in a moment, spread the plain, - Griffith.

Shlok 42: Thousands of demons are noticeable hither and yon, killed, fallen and enfeebled, and slashed, gashed 
and ripped. [3-25-42]

[Commentary] And thousands scarce alive were left / Mangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft. - Griffith.

Shlok 43- 44- 45- 46: Some severed heads still have their headgears and some bare, some arms are with armlets and some bare, 
while some with their arms cut off, some with their thighs cut off, some with their divers patterns 
of ornaments on their bodies have fallen on ground. Numerous horses and elephants are felled. Chariots, 
royal-fans, royal-parasols, war-flags of very many kinds are ravaged in many ways. Hit down by Rama's 
arrows spears and tridents are variously splintered, swords broken to pieces, darts and hatchets shattered 
and strewn around. Also the boulders are pulverised, various amazing arrows have gone to rack and ruin 
in many ways. Spread with such wreckage the earth has become horrifying for a glance. [3-25-43, 44, 
45, 46]

Shlok 47: On seeing the killed demons all the surviving demons have become enervated and they are rendered incapable 
to make a move towards Rama, the conqueror of enemy's capitals. [3-25-47]



SARGA 26
------------------------------

[Text] Rama eliminates fourteen thousand demons led by Duushana. Firstly, the forerunning demons are killed, 
next Duushana is routed, and then twelve other captains who on knowing Duushana's downfall dashed towards 
Rama. Left behind are only two, Khara and Trishira, the chiefs of that demonic force in Janasthaana.

Shlok 1: On seeing the shattering of his own forces, Duushana bid five thousand mighty-armed nightwalkers of 
monstrous impetus, and who knew no retreat in war, to attack Rama. [3-26-1]

Shlok 2b- 3a: And they with spears, scimitars, swords, and with the rains of boulders, trees and arrows rained incessantly 
and inordinately upon Rama from all over. [3-26-2b, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: Raghava, the virtue-souled, in his turn has neutralised that ghastly and life-taking storm of boulders 
and trees with his fierce arrows. [3-26-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: Like a bull receiving rain with closed eyes Rama assimilated that storming and then evoked an inordinate 
infuriation for eliminating all of the demons. [3-26-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: Exasperation prevailing on him who appeared to be highly blazing with the blaze of his own virtue, he 
then diffused Duushana and his army with arrows from all over. [3-26-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: And on becoming enraged Duushana, the railer of his rivals and the commander of that army, then virtually 
forestalled Raghava's onslaught with his arrows that are simulative of thunderbolts. [3-26-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: That valiant one in warring Rama is then infuriated and with his crescent-barbed arrow shivered the 
sturdy bow of Duushana, shredding four of his horses with four more arrows. [3-26-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: On destructing the horses with excruciating arrows, he even fragmented the head of the charioteer with 
a crescent-barbed arrow, and even impaled the chest of demon Duushana with some more arrows. [3-26-8b, 
9a]

[Commentary] One crescent dart he aimed which shred / Clean from his neck the driver's head; / Three more with deadly 
skill addressed / Stood quivering in the giant's breast. - Griffith.

Shlok 9b- 10- 11: With his bow fractured and chariot shredded, and with horses and charioteer killed, he that Duushana 
grabbed a mace which outranks a peak of mountain and a hair-thriller at its sight, and which girt with 
golden girths once gritted the armies of gods, the head of which is studded with incisive iron spikes 
and saturated with the fat of foes, a coequal of a diamond and a thunderbolt in its hardiness and flashiness, 
and a ransacker of the archways of fortresses of his adversaries. [3-26-9b, 10, 11]

Shlok 12: On firmly gripping that mace which in war is akin to an infernal serpent, and the touch of which tantamount 
to snakebite, rushed that nightwalker Duushana with infernal exerts rushed towards Rama. [3-26-12]

Shlok 13: While Duushana came falling on, he that Raghava sheared off his shoulders that have wrist-ornaments 
on his arms with two arrows. [3-26-13]

Shlok 14: When Duushana's arms are thus sheared in the van of war, his gigantic mace slipped and spun in his own 
front, like the flagstaff with flag raised in honour of Indra, and collapsed . [3-26-14]

Shlok 15: With both of his arms strewn around Duushana fell down onto earth like a haughty and gigantic elephant 
when both of its tusks are broken down. [3-26-15]

Shlok 16: On seeing Duushana eliminated and fallen to ground, all the beings have applauded Rama saying, 'good, 
good...' [3-26-16]

Shlok 17- 18a: In the meantime infuriated are the three leading commanders of that army, namely Mahakapaala, Sthulaaksha 
and great mighty Pramaathii, and they collectively ran towards Rama, bound by the rein of death. [3-26-17, 
18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Mahakapaala raising a broad trident, Sthulaaksha handling a scimitar, Pramaathi handling an axe rushed 
towards Rama. [3-26-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: As one would receive guests meeting his basic needs, Raghava too took on these untimely guests of war, 
rather the insurgents, meeting their basic needs which now are no more than highly sharpened acute edged 
arrows, when he saw them coming and falling upon him, inopportunely. [3-26-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21- 22- 23a: Rama, the legatee of Raghu, chopped off the head of Mahakapaala, with incalculable spates of arrows 
he eliminated Pramaathi, and filled the bulging eyes of Sthulaaksha with arrows by which Sthulaaksha 
is killed and fell down onto ground like a burly tree with its broad branches. Then still infuriated 
Rama forthwith eliminated the five thousand hench-demons of Duushana with five thousand arrows, and 
thus he led them to the residence of Time-god, namely the hell. [3-26-20b, 21, 22, 23a]

[Commentary] The words viTapi 'a tree with branches and twigs...' and druma 'a tree' in general. 
Though they are similar to give the general meaning of a tree, they are juxtaposed taking the viTapi 
as the adjective of the word druma. This is not exactly synonymic usage, but a shade of difference 
is available in both words. Readers may please refer to the excellent book of Dr. Satya Vrat, The Ramayana 
- A Linguistic Study.

Shlok 23b- 24a: On hearing about the killing of Duushana and also thus of the followers of Duushana, Khara irately ordered 
his army captains, under whose captaincy mighty forces are there. [3-26-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25: "Duushana is killed in war along with his followers, hence all you demons, take formidable army, take 
weapons of diverse designs, combat and kill that evil-human Rama..." Thus Khara ordered the remaining 
demons. [3-26-24b, 25]

Shlok 26- 27- 28: Saying so Khara himself rushed towards Rama in rage, and Shyenagaami, Prithugriiva, Yajnashatru, Vihangama 
Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, and Rudhiraaksha 
are the twelve fiendishly atrocious troop leaders of demonic forces, and they too rushed towards Rama 
launching their atrocious arrows. [3-26-26, 27, 28]

Shlok 29: He who is resplendent that Rama then annihilated the remaining demons of that army with his arrows that 
are embellished with gold and diamonds, and that are blazing like ritual-fires. [3-26-29]

Shlok 30: With those arrows that have golden tailpieces and sharp barbs, and that are dazzling like fuming ritual 
fires Rama felled the demons, as Thunderbolts of Indra will be felling gigantic trees. [3-26-30]

Shlok 31: With a hundred rudder like arrows Rama hit down a hundred demons, and with a thousand more, thousand 
more demons are hit in the forefront of that war. [3-26-31]

Shlok 32: Ripped are their shields and armorial-ornaments, ruined and rickety are their bows, and they the nightwalkers 
fell flat on ground, bodies wholly smudged with blood. [3-26-32]

Shlok 33: With those demons that have fallen down in war, whose hair is tousled and who are drenched in blood, 
entire earth looked like a vast altar of fire overspread with holy grass. [3-26-33]

Shlok 34: That forest which became sludgy with the flesh and blood of killed demons and very disgusting, in a 
moment it became identical with hell. [3-26-34]

Shlok 35: Thus that Rama, a lone one, that too a foot-soldier, has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of frightening 
exploits. [3-26-35]

Shlok 36: Of his entire army great-charioteer Khara and Trishira are the remaining nightwalkers, and Rama, the 
enemy destroyer, naturally on the other side. [3-26-36]

[Commentary] The last compound in the second foot indicates that Rama is also remaining as one among the army of 
Khara, which is found irksome to some scholars. They said that the older mms contain the expression
hata sheSau nishaaacaraa instead of raamaH ca ripu suudanaH taking the finishing line 
from the opening words of next verse. Otherwise, it can be said 'on the side of Khara only two demons, 
namely Khara and Trishira are remaining, and on the other side Rama is remaining...' as given here. 
But it is said to be inappropriate, because Rama cannot be grouped with the killable side. Further, 
there are some more petty demons besides Khara and Trishira, to carry a word to Ravana, as said in the 
coming chapters.

Shlok 37: Lakshmana's elder brother Rama eliminated all of the remaining demons in the forefront of war who are 
highly valorous, ghastly and unbearable. [3-26-37]

Shlok 38: Then on surveying that great demonic force which is eliminated by Rama in that staggering war, Khara 
then marched on to reach Rama in a huge chariot, as with Indra who will march upraising his Thunderbolt. 
[3-26-38]



SARGA 27
------------------------------

[Text] Trishira, the demon, supersedes Khara to fight Rama at his turn. He hits Rama with arrows for which 
Rama says that it is no more than the patting with flowers. Then a combat ensues and Rama becoming infuriated 
eliminates Trishira in the battle.

Shlok 1: But when Khara is about to lunge to the forefront of Rama, nearing him the commander of demonic forces 
named Trishira spoke this to him. [3-27-1]

Shlok 2: "Desisting from your personal adventure you enjoin me for I am an invader, and then you are certain 
to see me felling that mighty-armed Rama in combat. [3-27-2]

[Commentary] The spirit of soldiery is explained in this verse. When junior rankers are available, they are not supposed 
to allow higher ups to lunge forward in the first instance. Dharmaakuutam puts it thus, in Maha Bharata 
war, when Duryodhana himself wanted to deal with Arjuna, Ashvatthaama holds him back saying: mayi 
jiivati gaandhaare na yuddham kartum arhasi ... aham aavaara iSyaami paartham tiSTa suyodhana... 
'when I am alive you are not supposed to combat, I will take over Arjuna, you stay back, oh, Suyodhana...' 
But the same Suyodhana does not show this much war-nicety when killing the lone Abhimanyu, the son of 
Arjuna.

Shlok 3: "Taking oath on my weapon I promise to you that I truly wish to kill this Rama, as he deserves ill of 
all the demons by killing. [3-27-3]

Shlok 4: "Hold back your combative-adventurism and become an examiner to decide whether I am going to become 
his god of death in this combat, or he becomes mine. [3-27-4]

[Commentary] The word praashnikaH is said to a rare expression meaning 'one who asks questions, an examiner, 
a judge...' in its fine sense. Secondarily, it is 'a witness' 'a spectator.' [After Prof. Satya Vrat.]

Shlok 5: "If I were to kill Rama you may gladly proceed to Janasthaana, else if Rama kills me then you can adventurously 
proceed against him for a combat." Thus Trishira spoke to Khara. [3-27-5]

[Commentary] These verses have commentary in depth. sarva raakshasaam vadhaa artham 'he who is meant to 
kill all the demons...' raamam 'about that Rama...' yathaa - yathaa vat 'as it is, 
in his true form; aham prati jaanaami ' I am in the full know of him...' 'I know fully well 
that this Rama has come to eliminate all the demons...' These are the same words told by Sage Vishvamitra 
to Dasharatha when he came to take Rama and Lakshmana. tam vadhiSyaami ' him, I shall kill...' 
for that only sarvam aayudham aalabhe... 'all weaponry I am handling...' 'However, knowing 
him well I am handling these weapons for sake of show, only entice him to accord salvation to me firstly...' 
because aham vaa raNe mR^ityuH? 'can I be his death in war? No I cannot... eSa vaa samre 
mama mR^ityuH 'he is my death in combat...' muhur praasniko bhava for a while you become 
an examiner, and examine and know it yourself; raame a + hate sati, mayi ca nihate sati 'if 
Rama is not killed by me, or if I am killed by Rama, then you can adventurously proceed to him, and 
have your turn to get salvation at Rama's arrows...'

Shlok 6: By that death-greedy demon Trishira, Khara is manoeuvred and Khara to him said 'begone... combat...' 
and thus permitted, Trishira proceeded to the forefront of Rama. [3-27-6]

Shlok 7: Trishira with a lustrous chariot that is yoked with equally lustrous horses hurried towards Rama in 
that war, like a tri-peaked mountain, for they say, he is a tri-headed demon. [3-27-7]

Shlok 8: Discharging hosts of arrow-torrents like a hefty-arrow-cloud, he readily discharged a noise similar 
to the thudding drumbeat when a water-wet war-drum is beaten, rather than a blast from a heated drum. 
[3-27-8]

Shlok 9: On seeing the oncoming of that demon Trishira, Raghava welcomed him by speedily winnowing smarting arrows 
from his bow. [3-27-9]

Shlok 10: That grave and tumultuous encounter chanced between Rama and Trishira is like the extremely forceful 
encounter between a loin and an elephant. [3-27-10]

Shlok 11: Later when Trishira smote on the forehead of highly enraged Rama with three arrows, Rama's ire is intensified 
and he franticly said this to that demon. [3-27-11]

Shlok 12: "Oho! What an energy of a triumphing adventurer is this! A demon with this sort of energy is adventuring 
me, whose arrows rap my forehead peripherally, like flowers! [3-27-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: "Now you accept arrows plunging from the string of my bow..." saying thus, that infuriated Rama with 
his alacritous swiftness hit the chest of Trishira with fourteen arrows similar to venomous snakes. 
[3-27-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: With four of his straight shooting arrows that have hook-like barbs, that resplendent Rama hewed down 
four of the speedy horses of Trishira's chariot. [3-27-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: With eight arrows Rama felled the charioteer from his settle on the chariot, and with one arrow ripped 
off the high flying flag on that chariot. [3-27-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: When that nightwalker is vaulting from that smashed chariot Rama with his arrows tore his chest to shreds 
and he that Trishira became inert. [3-27-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: And with three sharp and rapid arrows, and even with his own exasperation, Rama of inestimable aptitude 
rolled the three heads that demon. [3-27-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: When that nightwalker is highly tortured with Rama's arrows he collapsed spewing blood with fumes, whereat 
he is standing in war, at where his three heads rolled just now. [3-27-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: As with the fleeing of deer alarmed by a tiger, the demons remaining after liquidation, whom Khara has 
protected so far and whose confidence is now shattered, are running away, and they gave Khara the run-around. 
[3-27-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b: On seeing at those deserters Khara is piqued and quickly brought them back to his control, and then 
as with the scampering of eclipsing planet Rahu towards moon during lunar-eclipse, he scurried towards 
Rama alone. [3-27-20b, c]



SARGA 28
------------------------------

[Text] Khara the demon brother of Shuurpanakha confronts Rama when all of his valiant warriors are eliminated. 
He wages a fearful war showing all his expertise and he even brings down the amour of Rama with his 
arrows. The combat of Rama and Khara takes a longer time, as Khara is not easy-to-deal demon.

Shlok 1: Khara is intimidated on seeing the elimination of Duushana along with Trishira inasmuch as the intrepidity 
of Rama is concerned. [4-28-1]

Shlok 2- 3: On seeing the annihilation of the insufferable and mighty force of demons, even that of Duushana and 
Trishira by lone Rama, and thus to apprehend that the demonic force is wholly destructed, that demon 
Khara became apprehensive, and then he lunged at Rama, as with demon Namuchi who once lunged at Indra. 
[4-28-2, 3]

Shlok 4: Forcefully drawing the bowstring fitted with iron-arrows, which looked like furious serpents of venom 
ingesting only blood, Khara discharged them on Rama. [4-28-4]

Shlok 5: Fidgeting with bowstring in many a way, brandishing missiles with many a skill, Khara moved about the 
battleground in many a manner, seated on chariot and showing his expertise with arrows. [4-28-5]

Shlok 6: That great chariot-fighter Khara then started to fill all the stretches and inter-stretches with arrows, 
seeing that even Rama reciprocally started to take aim with his bow Rama, and then filled and made the 
sky less of leeway with verily unendurable arrows that are like tongues of fire emitting sparks, as 
with Rain-god chocking the sky with torrents, less of latitude. [4-28-6, 7]

Shlok 8: No empty space is left out in the space around since it has become riotous with the sharp arrows discharged 
by Rama and Khara from everywhere. [4-28-8]

Shlok 9: While both of them are warring with excitement to slay one another, then the sun obscured with the mesh 
of arrows has not shined. [4-28-9]

Shlok 10: Then with acutely edged tubular, iron, and crescent-edged arrows Khara swatted Rama in that combat, 
as a great elephant will be swatted with a goad. [4-28-10]

Shlok 11: When charioted Khara came to the presence of Rama with bow in hand and ready for a close combat, that 
demon appeared to all beings as the Terminator handling his noose. [4-28-11]

Shlok 12: Khara presumed that greatly indefatigable Rama is wholly fatigued by now, though he has shown his mettle 
of boldness in eliminating all of the demonic forces, all the while. [4-28-12]

Shlok 13: On seeing Khara who is prancing like a lion with a gait of a lion, Rama is unruffled like a lion that 
sees a least beast. [4-28-13]

[Commentary] For the last compound in second foot the other versions contain siMhaH siMham iva aparam 'a 
lion on seeing another lion...' Firstly comparing Khara with lion and later comparing him with kshudra 
mR^iga 'petty animal...' is not found aesthetic by some scholars.

Shlok 14: In a chariot that equals the sun in its radiance then Khara reached Rama as a moth reaches fire. [4-28-14]

Shlok 15: Showing sleight of hand Khara then broke the handgrip of the bow of that great-souled Rama along with 
an arrow fitted on it. [4-28-15]

Shlok 16: Still infuriated Khara has drawn seven more arrows that equal the radiance of Indra's thunderbolts and 
hit Rama's armour in that war. [4-28-16]

Shlok 17: Then, on distressing Rama of unequalled vitality with a thousand arrows in that combat Khara blared 
a loud blare. [4-28-17]

Shlok 18: With the arrows released by Khara that have a great egress, then that armour of Rama that has a sun-like 
resplendence is completely destroyed and fell on the field. [4-28-18]

Shlok 19: When all his limbs are hit with arrows Rama is enraged and in that war Rama flared up like a fumeless 
flaring fire. [4-28-19]

Shlok 20: Then Rama, the blaster of enemies, strung bowstring to another thunderously blasting bow, to end the 
enemy. [4-28-20]

Shlok 21: That which is a very admirable bow of Vishnu and that which is awarded by great-sage Agastya, upraising 
that choicest bow Rama rushed towards Khara. [4-28-21]

Shlok 22: With arrows that have golden fins and curved barbs that highly infuriated Rama then fragmented Khara's 
flagstaff with flag in that war. [4-28-22]

Shlok 23: That eye-pleasing golden flagstaff with flag is severally shattered and fell onto ground as if it is 
god-damned sun fallen on earth. [4-28-23]

Shlok 24: By that Khara is enraged, and as one who is aware of striking crucial parts/war tactics assaulted on 
the chest of Rama with four arrows, and even on other limbs, as one would prod an elephant with lancets. 
[4-28-24]

Shlok 25: Impacted with various arrows unloosened from the bow of Khara, limbs of Rama are drenched in blood and 
he became highly indignant. [4-28-25]

Shlok 26: On aiming his great bow that ablest one among archers, namely Rama, then in that war released six arrows 
targeting pointedly. [4-28-26]

Shlok 27: Rama indeed hit Khara's head with one arrow, with two his hands, and next with three crescent shaped 
arrows he hit his chest. [4-28-27]

Shlok 28: Then afterwards that great-resplendent Rama wishing to eliminate the demon, infuriately launched 
thirteen iron arrows that are sharply whetted and similar to the dazzle of sun. [4-28-28]

Shlok 29- 30- 31: That mighty Raghava who equals Indra in combats, smiling at the warfare of Khara, smashed the yoke of 
the chariot with one arrow; with four, four of the dappled horses; with the sixth, the head of the charioteer 
of Khara; with three, the three-pronged shaft from yoke to the base of chariot; with two the axels, 
thus that chariot is fragmented. Then, on wrecking Khara's bow on which an arrow is placed with the 
twelfth, that mighty one Rama impaled Khara with the thirteenth arrow that is similar to a thunderbolt. 
[4-28-29, 30, 31]

Shlok 32: With his bow utterly shattered, chariot fragmented, horses killed, and charioteer felled, that Khara 
then hopped down to ground from the dilapidated chariot wielding a mace, and stood fast. [4-28-32]

Shlok 33: The gods as well as great-sages have then came together and assembled in heavens, and those assemblies 
that are aboard their aircrafts are highly gladdened at the exploit of the great chariot-fighter Rama, 
and they worshipped him with their adjoined palms. [4-28-33]



SARGA 29
------------------------------

[Text] Khara provokes Rama to fight, but Rama gives enough advise to Khara to yield up. Khara presumes that 
Rama is overtired to fight him back and thus enters into verbal fight. Ultimately Khara hurls a mammoth 
mace at Rama, which burns down all the neighbouring plants and bushes, and Rama splinters it down while 
it is still sky rocketing.

Shlok 1: Rama, the great-resplendent, spoke these words forbiddingly albeit softly to Khara who lost his chariot 
but staying his course wielding a mace. [3-29-1]

[Commentary] Rama is said to have tested whether Khara is ready to surrender or not, at least at this stage of loosing 
all paraphernalia of war. Hence he is said to have talked softly but harshly to that demon.

Shlok 2: "Although you hold sway over a gigantic force abounding with elephants horses and chariots, you have 
perpetrated heinous deeds in Dandaka forests that are loathsome to all the worlds, that is unseemliest 
to this soldiery. [3-29-2]

Shlok 3: "One who causes suffering to living beings, besides being a transgressor and completely ruthless, he 
does not stand up for himself even if he were to be the lord of all the three worlds. [3-29-3]

Shlok 4: "All people will eliminate him, oh, nightwalker, who is imperious and an infringer of worldly routine, 
as they would eradicate a vicious serpent, in the event of its running across them. [3-29-4]

Shlok 5: "He who goes on performing evils selfishly, obsessively, heedlessly, more so delightedly, he will see 
the results of his own doings, like red-tailed-lizard on its eating self-destructive hailstones, obsessively 
and delightedly. [3-29-5]

[Commentary] Hailstones are life-taking poisonous pellets to this particular red- tailed lizard, called brahmaNi 
. It is still called as 'bamaani' in Bhojpuri vernacular of Hindi.

[Commentary] Parting with some parts of one's own accrual is lobha, and craving for that which is absolutely 
unavailable is moha. People tend to commit sin while protecting their own accruals as well 
as trying to acquire unavailable things. But any person, if goes on undertaking these evils, even after 
realizing that both are mistakes, it is an unpardonable crime. The metaphor of a red-tail-lizard is 
said to be unavailable in older scripts. There is another variation to this foot wherein the simile 
is with a Brahman bereft of his self-respect, and that foot reads as: bhrSTaH pashyati duHkham sa 
braahmaNa paravaan iva .

[Commentary] Next, implying the prospective question of Khara, viz., 'What sin I have committed?' Rama answers it 
in the next verse.

Shlok 6: "The residents of Dandaka forest are the highly-propitious sages that tread the path of virtue, and 
oh, demon, what benefit you gain in killing them, really? [3-29-6]

[Commentary] Again Khara may ask, 'There are many more sinners, what will become of them, why holding me alone responsible?' 
For this Rama is saying that the sinners in general will get their punishment after their mortality 
when karmic cycle is over. But those that are not only sinners but cruel, and even abhorred by world, 
will ruin here only, because their merit accumulated in earlier births has come to a standstill on this 
earth itself. Those sinners will become like petrified trees trunks, they neither fall nor their boughs 
flower.

Shlok 7: "Even if a fortune is made for a lavish living with an iota of merit, the evildoers, that too reprobates, 
further more those that are abominated by world will not last long, no more that petrified tree trunks. 
[3-29-7]

Shlok 8: "One who undertakes evildoings will definitely and seasonably reap their fruits, which in his case will 
be ghoulish, as with the flowering of trees according to season. [3-29-8]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: That fruit of sin will not be immediate alike the a crop that yields long after sowing. 
Moreover the fruit of sin will be venomous, for the greedy harvester of that sin alone will devour it.

Shlok 9: "In the world one acquires the fruit of profane acts not before long, oh, nightwalker, and it will be 
like venomous food devoured. [3-29-9]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: 'As one quickly acquires the results of the venomous food devoured, oh, nightwalker, 
the perpetrator of profane acts will acquire their fruits that quickly, in the world.' Eating food, 
or committing a sin is simply subjective. If one commits sin unknowingly, that will be as good as the 
intake of venomous food, unsuspectingly. Both the poisonous food, and committing sins will act internally 
and rapidly than any other ruinous inflictor. Then the sinner, or the consumer of poisonous food will 
acquire an inconsolable wretched state.

Shlok 10: "I am the king who arrived to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even 
of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world.



"I am the one who arrived at the behest of the king Dasharatha, or Bharata to exterminate the lives 
of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation 
of world. [3-29-10]

[Commentary] The word 'raaj~na' is 'sent by some king' for it is in fifth case. Whereas the word 'raajaa' is 'as a 
king I have come...' This is as appearing in some mms. Dharmaakuutam uses 'raaj~naa' and says:
: anena loka 
upadrava karaH raaj~naa avashyam shikShaNiiyam iti suucitam | and he goes on quoting
vidura niiti Vidura's morals in Maha Bharata:
gururaatmavataam 
shaastaa shaastaa duraatmanaam | antaH pracchanna paapaanaam shaastaa vaivasvato yamaH ||

Shlok 11: "Now, my arrows that are decorated in gold will be released on you like snakes rebounding from a snake-pit, 
and they will tear you asunder, and on riving you they will bounce back into my quivers. [3-29-11]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: My arrows can pierce through your body, not only your body but to the core of earth, 
and they bounce back to re-enter my quivers like the snakes that emerge from snake pits and return to 
their pits when their task is over. Or, when these arrows enter your body that is akin to a snake pit, 
they will kill all the sins lying like snakes inside that body of yours, and return to my quivers.

Shlok 12: "Now eliminated in war, you along with your army will tread behind those sages that were treading the 
path of virtue, on whom you have so far feasted in Dandaka forest. [3-29-12]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: A kind of assurance is sounded here by Rama's words in saying that Khara will be absolved 
of his sins. Those that are eliminated by Rama are sure to get salvation. Here not only Khara but also 
entire army is going to get that salvation, if Khara surrenders at least at this stage. In Skanda Purana 
it is said: raama vidDhaa 
nishaacaraa baaNaiH su taaDitaaH | raamam aasaadya samare saayujya padaviim gataaH || skaanda puraaNa 
But this saayujua, salvation or getting to heavens is of a variety. In war those that sacrifice 
themselves in the fire of arrows will get indra loka. Those that conduct warfare unhappily 
thinking that death is the only result of war they get gandharva loka. Those that retreat or 
go begging for their lives and yet killed, they get guhya loka, and those that are fully aware 
of Kshatriya dharma and conduct righteous warfare they go to brahma loka. So says Maha Bharata. 
The same is said Bhagavad Gita yam yam vaa 
api smaran bhaavam tyajatyante kalebaram | tam tam evaiti kaunteya sadaa tad bhaava bhaavitaH || 
Gita 8-6.

Shlok 13: "Let the supreme sages who were earlier slain by you may now see abiding on their aircrafts, your abidance 
in hellish death pangs when assaulted with my arrows. [3-29-13]

[Commentary] The word nirayastham is literally 'in hell of Yama' but here it is the hell-like situation 
caused by Rama's arrows. If the literal meaning of 'in hell' is taken the above assurance of salvation 
etc., will be futile, hence, it is 'hellish pangs' by the hit of arrows.

Shlok 14: "Attack me as you wish... make an effort... you the knave of your clan... now I am going to toss your 
head down like a palm-fruit..." Thus Rama addressed Khara. [3-29-14]

[Commentary] It is questioned whether Rama is self-eulogizing when talking this way to Khara. It is contradicted 
saying that yuddha kaale 
viira vaadasya sva paraakrama anusaareNa utsaaha abhivR^idhyartham para tiraskaara artham ca - aatma 
stuti - karaNe doSha abhaavaat | dk 'there is nothing wrong in foretelling how brave a 
warrior is and it will not come under self-praise, in war...' and the commentator goes on quoting many 
references, for e.g., Karna in Maha Bharata says:
shuuraaH 
garjanbti satatam praavR^iShi iva balaahakaaH | 'brave ones will be regularly thundering 
like thundering clouds...'

Shlok 15: But when Rama said thus, Khara is infuriated and convulsed in anger, and he replied Rama with bloodshot 
eyes, laughing boisterously. [3-29-15]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: Khara 'laughed at' Rama's words of self-praise means that even the Supreme Being untiringly 
does some self-praise like telling 'I am here to save you... seek refuge in me for I alone can save...' 
in order to make Himself known to the adamants. The whole concept of Bhagavad Gita in telling that 'I 
am here... Know me thus...' etc., is for the same purpose. Thus, this is a laughable situation to those 
who are already in the know of Being. Presently it is Khara who was great Vedic Brahman once, but became 
an ogre by curse. Contrariwise, it is a 'laughable talk' of the Supreme Being, to non-knowers or for 
the non-adherers.

Shlok 16: "On killing average demons in war, oh, son of Dasharatha, how you praise yourself when you yourself 
are un-praiseworthy?" Thus Khara started to speak to Rama. [3-29-16]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: For this self-praise it is said that Khara estimated Rama as an unworthy being in the 
parlance of mortals. kharaH tu 
kopaat asamartho raama iti bhraantaa uktavaan iti no ko api doShaH | dk But as a cursed 
Vedic Brahman who is in the know of Rama as Vishnu is retorting Rama saying 'you also need to self-eulogise, 
when I am fully aware of you and come hither to gain my salvation at your hand? You are not supposed 
to self-extol before small beings like us...'

Shlok 17: "Those best of men that are victorious and mighty will not boast anything, for they will be really proud 
of their own valour. [3-29-17]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: This is said otherwise: ye nararSabhaaH 'those best ones among men like you...'
te 'by them...' [adhyaahaarya] evam 'elliptic: this way...' na kathayanti 
'do not praise themselves...' tejasaa svena garvitaaH kathayanti some of 'those that are proud 
of their own valorous resplendence, they speak up their glory, vaingloriously...' 'So it is unapt of 
you to speak up for yourself, for we are in the know of it, and we are waiting for our release from 
our curse at your hand...' Tiirtha.

Shlok 18: "Oh, Rama, as to how undignified Kshatriya-s that are frivolous and irresolute in self-confidence will 
boast in the world, likewise you too are boasting in a meaningless manner. [3-29-18]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: Khara's intent is: kSatriya paamsanaaH 'the Kshatriya, worthless... worthless 
Kshatriya-s...' yathaa nir arthakam vikatthase 'as to how they meaninglessly speak up for themselves...'
raama tvam vikatthante 'oh, Rama, you are speaking like that...' 'It is unapt of you to talk 
vainly like any other average Kshatriya, as you are an incarnate in a best Kshatriya clan, and you do 
your duty righteously without much talk...' Tiirtha.

Shlok 19: "Who will be that valiant that speaks about his lineage at wartime, that too, when the death-time is 
looming large! And, there will there be someone who broaches his self-extols in such an inopportune 
situation, is it! [3-29-19]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: Khara's saying is: samare 'in war...' [adhyaahaara]: shatru pakshe 
'elliptic: on the enemy's side...' mR^ityu kaale sampraapte sati 'death time, while chancing, 
that being so...' stavam ko vaa abhidaasyati 'self-praise, who, either, speaks out...' Thus, 
Khara's saying is: 'where is the necessity for any warrior to self-eulogise when the death-time is hovering 
upon his enemy? And you, as Rama, are on the winning spree in this war, and there is no necessity to 
extol yourself...' Tiirtha.

Shlok 20: "Howsoever your ignominy is well shown by your self-praise, like the manifestation of gold on the tip 
of grass-blade burnt by fire, where the fire on grass-blade is no fire, and the bulb of fire appearing 
at the tip of grass-blade as a bulb of gold, is no gold. [3-29-20]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: A blade of grass when burnt, immediately glows and manifests a globe of golden flame, 
but it is too quick to evanish thus it can not burn the gold to refine it. katthanena 'by broaching...'
te laghutvam 'your ignominy...' sarvathaiva vidarshitam ' in every way, well-shown...' 
and that ignominy is looking like taptena 'burnt...' kusha agninaa 'fire abiding the 
grass-blade...' suvarNa pratiruupeNa 'golden in hue...' laghutvam vidarshyate yathaa tathaa 
'lowliness of fire proper will be shown by that fire on grass-blade, likewise... tava laghutvam 
eva vidarshitam bhavat 'so also your own lowliness is made evident...' 'A small fire on a small 
grass-blade quickly burns though with a golden hue, but it cannot sustain its flame to burn other things. 
It burns the grass-blade on which it sits. So, self-ruinous is your self-eulogy...' Govindaraja.

[Commentary] kusha agninaa 'by grass-blade's fire...' that is used to purify golden material in rituals;
suvarNa prati ruupeNa 'gold, equalling in aspect...' namely brass items; taptena 'if 
burnt to purify...'; laghutvam 'stain of blakishness...'; If brass items are put to the same 
small fire of grass-blade they immediately become smoky, however small the fire may be; Thus te 
'by you...' katthanena 'by self-praising...' laghutvam vidarshitam 'your futility 
is well-shown...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

[Commentary] suvarNa prati ruupeNa tapyatena ashmanaa agninaa is another text. In this ashmanaa 
is 'stone...' If anyone touches a stone that is similar to fire outwardly, he does not feel the heat 
of the fire by the cold touch of stone. Thus, his 'foolishly mistaken identity' makes a fool of himself. 
Thus Khara is saying 'I was thinking that Rama is a very great valiant person, but by way of listening 
your self-eulogies, at an inopportune time, you appear to be a cold stone but not a firebrand... One 
who goes on self-eulogising without taking any action in a war is a coward but not a victor...' Thus 
Khara is quickening Rama to proceed with fighting so that the ensuing salvation can also be quickened.

Shlok 21: "But you are seeing me wielding a mace and standing before you like an unshakable and jagged mountain 
laden with ores, isn't it! [3-29-21]

Shlok 22: "As to how the Terminator wielding noose is enough to take away all the lives in all the three worlds, 
handling my mace I am enough for detracting your life from you. [3-29-22]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: 'I am not competent enough to combat with you...' is the sense that is drawn out.
gadaa dharam maam pashyasi nanu 'mace-wielder, me, you see, though...' 'Though you see me wielding 
this mace...' paasha hasta antaka iva 'noose-wielder Yama, Terminator, like...' 'Though I appear 
to be noose-wielding Terminator...' trayaNaam api lokaanaam praaNaan hantum paryaaptaH yadyapi tathaa 
api 'Though I can strike down the lives of all in all the three worlds with this single mace as 
Yama does so with only one noose...' raNe tava na paryaaptaH 'in war, with you, not, competent... 
'I am not competent enough to fight with you in war, for I am an inferior being in comparison to you, 
oh, Supreme Being...'

Shlok 23: "Even though much is to be said in your respect I will not continue to say, for the sun is getting at 
the dusk thereby disruption to war occurs. [3-29-23]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: This is the devil's advocacy about dharma yuddha 'righteous warfare...' which 
righteous war is generally waged from morning till evening. Khara says that 'because the sun is dusking 
you humans cannot war with us, the nightwalkers who are adept in night-wars. Thus by killing you in 
nighttime does not prove my victory, for your warfare is from sunrise to sunset. Hence, this war is 
to be stalled. If you quicken now without self-extolling, I will kill you before sunset, proving my 
chivalry and then I can dab the eyes of the wives of the demons so far killed by you...'

Shlok 24: "You have killed fourteen thousand demons and on killing you I will wipe the tears of the wives of those 
dead demons today itself." Khara said so to Rama. [3-29-24]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: Khara cannot return to his place after sacrificing these many demons. Either he should 
win or be won over. So 'when these many demons are eliminated by you... tvad vinaashaat = tvattaH 
naashaat 'by you if I am eliminated...' eSaam ashru pramaarjanam karomi 'their tears I 
will wipe... 'For I sacrificed fourteen thousand kinsmen of mine, and if I am also killed by you, their 
wives do not find fault with me and my death will wipe their tears out... that is why, though you tried 
to pacify and avert me from warring with soft talk mR^idu puurva bhaaSaNena, as at 3-29-1. 
I can not but war, and you need not think that I am heedless of your words...' Tiirtha.

Shlok 25: Saying thus that highly infuriated Khara hurled his mace towards Rama, around which there are superb 
golden cinctures, and which is extremely glaring like a thunderbolt. [3-29-25]

Shlok 26: Forcefully discharged from Khara's hands that highly fiery and stupendous mace rendering trees and shrubs 
down to ashes darted towards Rama. [3-29-26]

Shlok 27: When that monstrous mace similar to the halter of the Terminator is swooping down, Rama smashed it to 
smithereens with his arrows while it is still sky rocketing. [3-29-27]

Shlok 28: That mace splintered with arrows of Rama fell crumbling onto the surface of earth as a springing female 
snake would fall down by the strength of spells and nostrums. [3-29-28]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: The mention about Khara's mace may be noticed. In the text, its reference has come 
more often and at the end it is said to have burnt down the vegetation along its course of travel, which 
indicates that it has some radiation power. Without making it to touch the ground, Rama has splintered 
it in sky itself, and its destruction is metaphoric with a venomous serpent, and hymns and herbs can 
bring down that serpent. That is to say even if venomous missiles are used their antidotes are ready 
at hand. For this Dharmaakuutam says, without expanding:
anena mantra 
auShadhi balaiH viSha aadi naasha ukto bhavati | dk 'any poison can be neutralised by 
antidotes, say spells and nostrums...'



SARGA 30
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Khara exchange a haughty wordy duel and when the demon Khara charges at Rama, Rama eliminates 
him with his all-powerful arrow and gods and sages shower flowery rain. Seetha and Lakshmana return 
from their hiding cave and Seetha becomes very happy on seeing her victorious and indefatigable husband.

Shlok 1: On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him out of temper, without 
assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of virtue following the protocol 
of righteous war. [3-30-1]

[Commentary] This seems to be a roundabout meaning. But to explain why the epithet dharma vatsala to Rama 
is given, this beating round the bush is necessary. So also, many epithets used in this epic have relevance 
to the circumstances, characters, or their actions. These cannot be explained without the support of 
commentaries, and unfortunately commentaries skip these minor details assuming that the readers are 
capable enough to grasp them in the course of narration, which resulted otherwise at a later time. We 
therefore request pundits to consolidate the relevancy of each the inordinate epithet used to the situations 
narrated somewhere like web, if it is going to cost a fortune on printing and stationary. Explaining 
them occasionally is unnoticed, and they appear to be redundant metre fillers in these days where Sanskrit 
itself has become an alienated language.

Shlok 2: "So, this is all the strength of yours and your army that is displayed and nothing more to display, 
is it! You wretched demon, it is paltriest compared to my strength, yet you vaunt aloud futilely! [3-30-2]

Shlok 3: "This mace of yours in which you repose your bombastic aplomb, now completely battered with my arrows 
has gone onto the surface of earth, so also is your vanity. [3-30-3]

Shlok 4: "What that is said by you, 'I will dab the tears of the demons whose kinfolk are dead here...' even 
this word of yours is a fake. [3-30-4]

Shlok 5: "In boasting you are knavish, in character roguish, and in behaviour ghoulish, such a demon as you are, 
I will take your life away as the Divine Eagle Garuda took away Ambrosia. [3-30-5]

Shlok 6: "Now, my arrows will rip and chop off your throat, and then the earth will guzzle the blood gushed therefrom 
garnished with froth and foam. [3-30-6]

Shlok 7: "You will go to eternal sleep embracing the earth as you embrace an un-gainable lady, when both of your 
arms are knocked down to slide on earth, and limbs smeared with dirt. [3-30-7]

Shlok 8: "While you are in profound sleep, oh, notorious demon, this Dandaka forest becomes a shelter to the 
shelter-worthy sages and saints. [3-30-8]

Shlok 9: "When the strongholds of demons in your Janasthaana are ruined with my arrows, the sages in this forest 
will move about everywhere, fearlessly. [3-30-9]

Shlok 10: "The demonesses who terrorized others so far will be pitiably terrorised now, and they flee away very 
quickly with tear-wet faces as their kinsmen are killed. [3-30-10]

Shlok 11: "To which demonesses your kind of grievous demon is the husband, they must have taken birth in a befittingly 
grievous family like that of yours, and must be well-matched to you in grievous atrocities, and though 
they might not have tasted a grievous situation so far, since their lives have become meaningless, now 
they will become the enjoyers of the empathy of grief. [3-30-11]

Shlok 12: "You are atrocious in conduct because you countervail against Veda-s, debased by conscience because 
you counteract to Vedic rituals, and you are countermanding Vedic procedures because you have always 
been bothersome to Brahmans, and those Brahmans becoming sceptical of your deeds of hindrance, they 
are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be swiftly dropped into fire to 
the chants of hymns and even on time, hence you are countervailing against Veda-s and counteracting 
to their rituals, and countermanding their procedures." Thus Rama spoke to Khara irefully. [3-30-12]

Shlok 13: While Raghava is speaking that way with such an impetuosity in that forest, Khara started to intimidate 
him rancorously in a voice stridulous than braying. [3-30-13]

Shlok 14: "Priding yourself resolutely you are unfearing even in a fearful situation, thereby you have indeed 
gone into the control of death, and for sure you are unmindful of what is speakable and what is not." 
Thus, Khara started his tongue-lashing. [3-30-14]

Shlok 15: "Such of those men on whom the Lead of the Time verily closes in, they will not know what is to be done 
and what not, for all of their six senses will be rendered insensible." Thus Khara intimidated Rama. 
[3-30-15]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: For the above three verses it said: evam bruvaaNam raamam 'to Rama who saying 
that way...' mR^ityu vashya kharaH 'Khara going under the control of Death...' is saying 'oh, 
Rama...' tvam vaacya a+vaacya na budhyase iti 'you know not what to speak and what not to speak 
- to a dying creature like me, because that creature's six-senses are stand-still...' Then why is this
nirbhartsayana, roSa? 'threatening me, and anger at me?' 'Because the faculties of that dying 
creatures, presently mine, will be in a flux, they will attack anyone verbally or physically, let alone 
the Almighty... thus you are not able to distinguish between what is to be done or not to be done with 
such a senseless creature... So, what you have to do now is to finish me, and what is not to be done 
is this sermonising. Why not finish me off from this curse and accord salvation?' Maheshvara Tiirtha.
anena maraNa samaye janaanaam buddhi bhramsho bhavati iti sUchitam - dk 'at the time of death 
people's mind deranges...'

Shlok 16- 17a: Saying so to Rama that nightwalker Khara then knitting his brows tightly saw everywhere for an assault 
weapon for use in that combat, and then he indeed found one not far away from him, namely a huge saala 
tree. [3-30-16, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: He curled his lips in frown and started to extricate that Saala tree, and that great-mighty Khara on 
forcefully uprooting that tree with both of hands hurled it aiming at Rama, braying loudly and shouting 
at him 'you are dead...' [3-30-17b, 18]

Shlok 19: But that adventurous Rama on shredding that tree which is swooping down with a torrent of arrows, and 
deciding to eliminate that Khara in that war evoked an unusual rancour, which rancour is equally an 
unusual facet of Rama. [3-30-19]

[Commentary] The inveterate bitterness of Rama is to see the unyielding Khara at a time when all of his war paraphernalia 
is lost, but still trying to be aggressive, rancorously.

Shlok 20: Rama whose body is perspiring and whose eyes are acrimoniously bloodshot at ends, he utterly shredded 
Khara with a thousand arrows in that war. [3-30-20]

Shlok 21: Copious frothy blood gushed out from the gashes of arrows on the mountainous body of Khara, like the 
rapids on Mt. Prasavana, and it overflowed on earth too. [3-30-21]

[Commentary] Mt. Prasavana is depicted in Kishkindha canto where Rama admires and eulogises the rainy season when 
waiting for Sugreeva's help.

Shlok 22: When Khara is tormented with the arrows of Rama in that conflict he is bedevilled and with his blood 
stinking body he quickly bolted towards that Rama alone. [3-30-22]

Shlok 23: When Khara is descending on boisterously with his body bathed in blood, that adept one in the Science 
of Archery, dhanur veda , the scripture on archery, and that valorous Rama, 
in swiftness lurched a little...say, two or three steps... [3-30-23]

[Commentary] On this back stepping, backtracking, or the scrape Rama took in war, [ scrape - intr. draw back a foot 
in making a clumsy bow; and here without clumsiness of bow]; much discussion is available discussing 
whether Rama can retrace his step or not. It is said that stepping back in war is prohibited for a valorous 
warrior or to the epical hero. sa~Ngraame sa~Nsthaanam anivR^ittiH ca - gautama and many more 
scriptures say this. And a relaxation to such a stance is said: kvacit ati sankaTa viShaye subhaTaanaam 
abhito ayam apasarpaH - vedaanta deshika But here Rama is taking a runner's back-leg and it is 
not to be construed as an act of cowardice. Dharmaakuutam clarifies this as: vasca shatru vadhe 
kaamayamaana raamsya dhanuShi baaNa sandhaana aadi saukaryaartham apasarpaNam raameNa kR^itam bhuuShaNam 
eva na tu duuShaNam | ata eva muule apasarpaNe kR^ita astram eva hetumatvena maharShiNaa upanyastham 
| anantara shlokena khara vadaaya shara sandhaana mokShaNa aadi pratipaadanam upapannam bhavati | bhityaa 
apasarpaNe punaH shara mokSha anupapatto riti | dk 'Wishing to eliminate the demon Rama has taken 
a back step. It is only to have a leeway between his target, arrow, and arrow-flinging place... In the 
verse itself the great-sage Valmiki incorporated words like kR^ita astra that Rama is an exponent 
in archery [keeping some doubting Thomas' in view.] Further, in the next few verses Rama eliminates 
Khara, thus it is not an act of cowardice...'

[Commentary] More so, some scholars hold that this verse has got grammatical glitches, some ancient mms reads this 
verse as, even though this verse too has the word apasarpaNa scrape:
tam aapatantam 
vegena iiptaasyam rudhira plutam | apasR^itya tataH sthaanaat dR^iShTvaa tvarita vikramaH ||

Shlok 24: Then, Rama snatched an arrow which is similar to the Ritual-fire, and secondary only to the ultimate 
missile, namely the Brahma-missile, for the elimination of Khara in war. [3-30-24]

Shlok 25: That particular arrow is made available to Rama through Sage Agastya by the king of gods, namely Indra, 
because Indra is a sensible one about the future course of events, and he is also prosperous in securing 
impossible weaponry, and now Rama fitted such an arrow on his bow and released it towards Khara. [3-30-25]

Shlok 26: That formidable arrow is promptly released on Rama's stretching the bowstring up to his ear, bending 
bow almost to a circularity, and which arrow is thunderous while in egress like the thunder of a thunderbolt, 
and that has come and plunged inthe chest of Khara. [3-30-26]

Shlok 27: Khara fell down on to earth and on being burnt by the radiation of that arrow he is like demon Andhaka, 
who once was very completely burnt by Rudra in Shveta-araNya, the White-forest. [3-30-27]

[Commentary] Andhaka is the son of Danu, the wife of Kashyapa Prajaapati, and her progeny is termed as daanava-s, 
demons. Shiva burns this Andhaka with his Third-eye in Shveta-forest, which is said to be at the confluence 
point of River Kauvery in ocean.

Shlok 28: As with fall of demon Vritta or fall of demon Bala who are eliminated by Indra with his Thunderbolt, 
or as with the collapse of demon Namuchi who is eliminated by the same Indra just with forth or foam, 
Khara too is brought down. [3-30-28]

[Commentary] The demon Namuchi secures a boon from the gods that he may not die by wetness or dryness, so Indra uses 
foam and forth, which are neither wet nor dry, to eliminated him.

Shlok 29- 30a: In this meantime gods gathering along with carana-s drummed celestial drums from all over and showered 
flowers on Rama from all over. [3-30-29, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31: And those gods and other celestials in their amazement said among themselves that 'in one and half hours, 
say seventy two minutes of this extreme crack-down Rama with his sharp arrows has eradicated fourteen 
thousand guise changing demons, including their chieftains Khara and Duushana. [3-30-30b, 31]

Shlok 32- 33a: "Aha! Surprising is this great deed of Rama, the shrewd-soul, what a valour, what a fortitude, really, 
his valour and fortitude are like those of Vishnu..." Thus saying that way all of those gods have gone 
away as the have come. [3-30-32, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: All the kingly-sages and elite-sages along with Sage Agastya, who as incidentally came here to witness 
the victory of Rama, then on foregathering near at Rama delightedly said this on adoring him. [3-30-33b, 
34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: "He that great-resplendent one, the controller of demon Paka, and the destroyer of enemy's cities, namely 
Indra, once came to the meritorious hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga only for the purpose such an elimination 
of demons. [3-30-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b- 36a: "For the purpose of eradicating these demons who are the evildoers by nature and the natural enemies 
to saintly people you are led to this countryside by the great sages with an ideation. [3-30-35b, 36a]

Shlok 36b- 37a: "That which is the task of ours it is accomplished by you, oh, son of Dasharatha, now that Dandaka is 
unimpeded these great-sages will be practising their respective sacred devoirs in it." Thus, the sages 
expressed their thanksgiving. [3-30-36b, 37a]

Shlok 37b- 38a: In the meanwhile the brave Lakshmana exiting from the mountain cave came along with Seetha to their 
hermitage, and he is charmed at the victory of his brother Rama. [3-30-37b, 38a]

Shlok 38b- 39a: And then that brave and victories Rama too came towards hermitage while great-sages reverenced him, 
and he entered the hermitage while Lakshmana came forward to greet him. [3-30-38b, 39a]

Shlok 39b- 40a: And Seetha on seeing her husband, the eliminator of enemies and accorder of happiness to sages, embraced 
her husband Rama, rejoicingly. [3-30-39b, 40a]

Shlok 40: Janaka's daughter Seetha on seeing the hordes of demons eliminated, and even on observing her husband 
is also scatheless, she is all-smiles for him smiling sniggeringly. [3-30-40]

[Commentary] Any wife on seeing her husband returning from a risky journey will embrace her husband delightfully, 
and nothing special about it. But the commentators attach a great significance to this situation.

[Commentary] Firstly Seetha is hR^iSTaa 'exultant...' 
more than happiness. Rama's victory is the cause for that. sati dharmiNi dharmaaH 
'nature will have its own peculiar property...' Rama's victory is the peculiar property
dharmi, and the exultancy caused is its nature dharma.
hR^iSTaa 'exulted' 'thrilling, hair-raising, electrifying' 'as though the 
inner joy is going to outburst trough the skin pores...' Such is the joy of Seetha.

[Commentary] The cause for the extreme exultancy is said next.
Vaidehi, is the daughter of Videha King, Janaka and when she is said so, 
it is remembered that mithila adhipatiH viiraH 'Mithila's king is the bravest 
of the brave...' Thus, she is aware what bravery and victory are, and knowing that she hailed her victorious 
husband, for she is a worthy princess. bhartaaram pariSvaje 'husband, embraced...' 
Is Rama a husband of Seetha or to total Universe? loka bhartaaram suSuveya. 
He is the husband of the total Universe. When she is the mother of all beings in the universe, and when 
her husband protects her progeny from the evildoers, will she not embrace that husband of hers, as well 
as of the Universe? The word bharta 'one who bears...' and this Rama has 
no other burden to bear, except the Universe.

[Commentary] This embracing is pariSvaje, pari sa svaje 
'wholly embraced.' She embraced him from all over and fomented his war-wounds with her warm breasts. 
Then, why for this much happy hugging? It is replied: maharSiiNaam sukha aavaham 
pariSvaje 'one who brought comfort to great-sages, him she embraced...' The great-sages are her 
children, supplicating her to recommend to the Supreme Being to bestow His grace for their salvation. 
Since Rama brought some relief by his paternal affection to these children-like sages, she is happy 
and hugging.

[Commentary] Seetha came out of a mountain cave and embraced Rama. This suggests 
that the innate soul sheSi on the advise of a teacher, after leaving the 
cave-like living being, is released from bondages and embraces the master sheShin. 
This is the same predicament for her in Sundara Kanda, where the teacher Hanuma advises her to come 
with him, but she refuses, because her lord alone has to come conquering, as he has done now as far 
as her confinement is concerned. Here she is put in cave and guarded by Lakshmana, unlike demonesses 
guarding her in open-air gardens in Lanka. She came out of the cave and is joining her husband. Govindaraja.

[Commentary] Next, Maheshvara Tiirtha records: tam dR^iSTvaa 
shatru hantaaram 'at him Rama, on seeing, enemy, eliminator...'in that compound:
tam 'at him...' that Rama, which one-Rama assumed himself as fourteen thousand 
Rama-s, appearing as each to each demon at the time of war, with his divinely gracious aspect
divya mangala vigraha and eliminated all demons, that Rama she saw.
te tu yaavanta evaa~Nau taavaan tu dadR^ishe sataiH As many demons are 
there, so many Rama-s are there on the battlefield.

[Commentary] tam 'at him...' 'who eliminated fourteen 
thousand demons, single-handedly, , that too in seventy two minutes. These demons are so far undeafted 
even by Indra with all his forces. Rama defeated such demons without any damage to his person,
a + vyayam 'unscathed, undamaged... and very easily also...' at such a 
Rama Seetha saw.

[Commentary] tam 'him' who looks girlish. Seetha 
once said that Rama is girly not only in his looks but also in bravery, perhaps.

raama jaamaataram 
praapya striyam puruSha vigraham Ayodhya Part I, 30-3. When Rama dissuades Seetha from 
coming to forests, Seetha said to Rama, 'my father is the King of Mithila and he may think that you 
have left me behind at Ayodhya unable to protect me in forests... thus my father may also think that 
he got a 'girl' as his son-in-law in you...' Through this is a tongue-in-cheek expression Seetha reminded 
Rama at that situation of his Mohini ruupa 'getup of Mohini...' which he 
assumed at the time of churning Milky Ocean, it is her woomanhood that spoke like that. Though not then, 
even now Rama looks girlishly pleasant, if he is not summoning wrath upon him, as per his attributes,
puNDarika vishaala aksha, somavat priya darshanaH 'lotus-petal-eyed, moon-like-delightful-aspect...' 
And he becomes unsightly, only if angered. Such a girlish Rama has won war, and at him Seetha saw in 
admiration about his mannishness. Now her father Janaka will definitely appreciate his son-in-law Rama. 
King Janaka is a result-oriented king, as said in Gita, 3-20: karmaNi evahi samsiddham 
aasthitaH janakaadayaH 'Janaka and others are involved in self-less- result-oriented deeds...' 
and facing him without results is impossible. Thus Seetha's opinion is 'my father Janaka who is result-oriented 
and self-less in his pursuits, he will now appreciate Rama, since Rama has also accomplished a self-less 
pursuit in saving the sages...'

[Commentary] tam shatru hantaaram 'at him... who 
has annihilated the enemies in war...' as he has annihilated troops and troops of unwieldy demons as 
said at: taiH dhanuu~NShi 
dhvaja agraaNi carmaaNi ca shiraa~Nsi ca || 3-25-21 and at bahuun sa hasta aabharaNaan uuruun kari kara 
upamaan | 3-25-22 [A] and also who later said that he will emerge, as and when needed 
to eradicate vice, as at paritraNaaya saadhuunaam vinaashaaya ca duSkR^itaam - 
Gita: 4-8 And Seetha saw at such an omnipotent Being who is an eliminator of evil.

[Commentary] maharSiNaam sukha aavaham 'for great-sages, 
accorder of comfort...' dR^iSTvaa vaidehii babhuuva 'on seeing Vaidehi 
became...' she became one with herself bhuu sattaayaam. When it is said
aatmaa vai puruSasya daaraa 'wife indeed is the soul of manl...' that soul 
of Rama, namely Seetha is so far in a dilemma, because Rama is a lone-warrior against fourteen-thousand 
demons and his safe return is ambiguous. Now that he remained unhurt, that soul called Seetha, has regained 
her abode in Rama. Then hR^iSTaa pariSvaje 'delightfully embraced...' Maheshvara 
Tiirtha.

[Commentary] Dharmaakuutam also derives the same meanings, but with reference 
to dharma:

[Commentary] siitaa -- anaparaadhi raakShasa jana vadho na ucita iti vaidehii kR^ita pratiShedham api - apyaham jiivitam 
jahyaam tvaam vaa site - iti prakaareNa anaadR^itya - caturdasha sahasraaNi raakShasa -- ekasca raamo 
-- iti R^iShi janaanaam api samshayite uddhe kruurataraan raakShasaan hatvaa - avyatho yo raamaH taadR^ishaH 
paraamR^ishyate -- siitaa -- tathaa ca - shatru hantaaram maharShiNaam sukha aavaham -- iti - avyadham 
iti ca visheShaNaani upapannaani bhavanti -- ata eva ete arthaa uttara slokaabhyaam upasamhR^itaaH

Shlok 41: She whose face is beaming with delight that Seetha, the daughter Janaka, on seeing Rama who has eliminated 
demonic troops, and whom great-sages are worshipping, again embraced him and became rapturous. [3-30-41]



SARGA 31
------------------------------

[Text] A spy of Ravana named Akampana rushes to him to break the news of annihilation of Janasthaana 
			by Rama. He suggests Ravana to abduct Seetha. Because parting with Seetha causes grief to 
			Rama and thereby he dies. On thinking for while, Ravana goes to Mareecha seeking his help 
			in abducting Seetha. Mareecha while explaining Rama's capabilities, reminds us of the incarnations 
			of Vishnu, and advises Ravana to be content with what he has.



This chapter is removed from the critical edition and retained by traditional versions There 
			are discussions on this chapter whether it is the original work or an interpolated one. 
			Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana's character inevitably has continuity 
			in the war scene at the end.

Shlok 1: Then on going hurriedly from Janasthaana and on speedily entering Lanka Akampana spoke these words to 
Ravana. [3-31-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, king, many demons positioned in Janasthaana are killed, Khara is also killed in war, and somehow 
I have come here. [3-31-2]

[Commentary] dhvani/allusion: Janasthaana is the castle-gateway to Lanka. Lanka is a city built within its castle-walls 
and it has no countrysides or villages at least, annexing it. If Janasthaana is ruined, Lanka is also 
going ruin soon, because none can crossover the bulwark-like-Janasthaana. raajan 'oh, king of demons...' 
'when demons in Janasthaana are ruined, your kingship gets ruined...' bahavaH 'many...' 'not one or 
two, many demons that are guarding Lanka from Janasthaana are hataaH 'dead...' Then Ravana may ask 'what 
is it Khara doing then?' kharaH ca 'Khara, also' is dead. By this ca 'also' Trishira, Duushana etc., 
are also reported as dead.

Shlok 3: Thus said, then that ten-faced Ravana is infuriated with bloodshot eyes, and as though to burn down 
whole world with his radiance he spoke this to Akampana. [3-31-3]

Shlok 4: "Who is that dead-and-gone that has destroyed my indomitable Janasthaana? Who is it that has indeed 
opted for no recourse in all of the worlds? [3-31-4]

Shlok 5: "Evoking indignation in me it is really impossible for Indra to be happy; even for Kubera - no; for 
Yama - no; why them, even Vishnu cannot be happy. [3-31-5]

Shlok 6: "I am the End-Time for the Time-god himself, I will burn down the Fire-god, and I am capable of conjoining 
Death with the virtue of deathliness. [3-31-6]

Shlok 7: "If I am enraged I will incinerate Sun-god or Fire-god just with my radiance, I will halt even the impetuosity 
of Wind-god with that of mine." Thus Ravana said about himself. [3-31-7]

Shlok 8: Akampana with his palms adjoined and voice hesitant with fear sought for the clemency of that decahedral 
demon Ravana who is enraged in that way. [3-31-8]

[Commentary] The words decahedron, decahedral - a solid figure with ten faces - are the fancied usage for Ten-Throated 
or Ten-Faced demon. Ravana has also got the name of dashagriiva, and he is a 'solid' demon.

Shlok 10: When the supremo of demons Dasha-griiva pardoned him then that Akampana spoke these words, unfalteringly 
and trustfully. [3-31-9]

Shlok 10: "He is a youth whose shoulders are mighty, arms round and lengthy, built like that a lion, who is the 
son of Dasharatha and known as Rama. [3-31-10]

Shlok 11: "He is blue-black in complexion, a highly renowned one with matchless might and valour, a magnificent 
one such as he is he slew Duushana along with Khara in Janasthaana." [3-31-11]

Shlok 12: On hearing the words of Akampana, the chief of demons Ravana, spoke these words hissing like a kingly 
serpent. [3-31-12]

Shlok 13: "The question is whether that Rama arrived at Janasthaana associated with Indra and along with all of 
the immortal gods? Oh, Akampana, speak about it. [3-31-13]

Shlok 14: Akampana again detailed about the might and valour of that great souled Rama on hearing that sentence 
of Ravana. [3-31-14]

Shlok 15: "Rama means someone who is highly resplendent, an ablest archer among all archers, one who is endowed 
with divine missiles and divine attributes, and he is the one who conducts warfare with a supreme conduct. 
[3-31-15]

Shlok 16: "And a mighty one with redly eyes and drumbeat like voice, and whose face is shiny like the full-moon 
is Rama's selfsame younger brother known as Lakshmana. [3-31-16]

Shlok 17: "Alike the wind associating with fire this Lakshmana is associated with that glorious and nonpareil 
prince Rama, and that firestorm, namely Rama, destroyed Janasthaana. [3-31-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: "They are not any great souled gods or any heavenly beings as such, hence there is no need to doubt 
about it. Rama unloosened his gold-finned and feather-winged arrows, which on becoming five-faced serpents 
started consuming the demons. [3-31-18]

Shlok 19b- 20: "To whichever nook those demons smitten by fear of those serpent-like are fleeing, they have seeing 
Rama alone standing afore them in that corner, and oh, merited king Ravana, in this way your Janasthaana 
is totally ruined by that Rama. [3-31-19b, 20] [3-31-19]

[Commentary] Rama appeared to have assumed fourteen-thousand forms of one Rama svecChaa gR^ihiita dehaiH, and appeared 
confronting on the path of each and every demon who is trying to take shelter in a corner. Rama further 
appeared in each of the objects the demons wanted to pick up and fight back, say trees, boulders etc. 
raamam eva agrataH sthitam pashyanti - Tiirtha. Because the demons are smitten by fear, that fear reflected 
one Rama as fourteen thousand Rama-s, and it is not any divine trick or magic done by Rama. - Govindaraja. 
It is same with Kamsa in Bhaagavata when he sees one Krishna as many Krishna-s in his fear.

Shlok 21: On hearing the words of Akampana Ravana said these words, "I will to go to Janasthaana to kill Rama 
along with Lakshmana." [3-31-21]

Shlok 22: When Ravana said so then Akampana said these words in reply, " listen, oh, king, what all has happened, 
and of what in actuality is Rama's spirit and grit. [3-31-22]

[Commentary] Akampana is saying that what all has happened to the dead demons is in accordance with their deeds done 
when they are alive yathaa vR^ittam 'as they have done inhuman deeds thus they got punishment.' These 
dead demons are the actual troublemakers to the sages at the behest of Ravana.
yadaa na 
khalu yaj~nasya vighna kartaa mahaabalaH || 1-20-18 As said by Sage Vishvamitra, Ravana 
does not cause any hindrances to ritual, but these hench-demons do. So, they reaped the fruits of their 
actions. Or, raamasya vR^ittam: itihaasa puraaNa prakiirtita vR^ittam 'that which is enshrined in legends 
and mythology, I will tell those aspects of Rama.' yathaa vat balam pauruSam 'as it is his might and 
grit...' 'I will let you know about them...' So said Akampana to Ravana. - Tiirtha.

Shlok 23: "Rama, the highly renolwned, is invincible just by braving against him, for that Rama in fury can stall 
the onrush of a plethoric river with his arrows. [3-31-23]

[Commentary] Rama does not tolerate the upheaval of the system thus he becomes infuriated kupitaH as and when anything 
unwarranted occurs. And this fury is a getup to Rama, but it is not his innate nature because ramayate 
iti raamaH 'he who delights is Rama...' Thus he cannot always become furious. He is invincible just by 
brute-force vikrameNa a+saadhyaH . Thus he is approachable only in accordance with a set system 
conduct. Further, the word a+saadhya is not coupled with any other sub-words upapada, so he is invincible 
even to Brahma, Rudra, Indra et al. By this Vishnu's trivikrama incarnation is indicated. He can stop, 
or bifurcate the plethoric river stream just by his intention, leave alone arrows.
bhayaanaka 
aavarta shataakulaa nadii maargam dadau sindhuH iha shriyaH pateH -- bhaagavata In Bhaagavata 
the tumultuous river gave way to carry Krishna to go to the other side. Thus the incarnation of Krishna, in 
earlier times, or in the forthcoming eras, is suggested. - Tiirtha. As a river gives way to fishes to 
swim, his matsya 'Fish...' incarnation is also suggested.

Shlok 24: "That magnificent Rama can collapse even the firmament along with its starlets, stars and planets, and 
he even can elevate the earth if it were to collapse. [3-31-24]

[Commentary] By the attributes of stars and planets to the firmament, the Golden-Egg hiraNya garbha is suggested. 
So, he is the Originator. In the incarnation as vikrama 'Dwarf-boy...' he set one of his feet on the 
yonder blue, hence the firmament has no value for him. siidantii mahiim uddharet Raising the sinking 
earth is suggestive of varaaha 'Wild Boar...' incarnation, where he uplifted drowning earth on the snoot 
of a wild boar. And again siidantii mahiim uddharet where mahi is taken as people, and it is said 'when 
people on earth are sinking/collapsing under tyranny, he uplifts them...' as he is the ultimate absolver 
and terminator of the creation. Govindaraja and Tiirtha.

Shlok 25: "On breaching the shoreline of the ocean with his arrows that lord Rama can deluge worlds, and he can 
stem the tide of turbulent ocean, or can even stall the agent of that turbulence, namely the wind. [3-31-25]

[Commentary] The deluging worlds suggest samkarSaNa aspect. Govindaraja. Because he deluges all the worlds, he is 
yuga antakaH 'the epoch-ender...' The said 'Air' suggests other elements also, like Fire, Water etc., 
as said in pR^idvii apsu liiyate, aapaH tejasa liiyate 'earth merges in waters, waters merges in fire...' 
thus he can stem the tide of all the elements, taking samhR^itya from the next verse. Tiirtha.

Shlok 26: "That great valorous and the ablest among humans is capable to destroy all the worlds with his valour, 
and even capable of creating the people again.



Or, again dissolving all the worlds into himself, that great contemplator who transcends all is even 
capable of creating the creation again from out of him. [3-31-26]

[Commentary] The word shR^STi does not mean crafting anything anew. It is from sR^ij 'releasing out...' The innate 
souls jiiva are not created anew, they are ever there. But they emerge out of Brahman and resolve in 
Him according to their karmic cycle. This is Gita's concept. He 'creates worlds again...' indicates 
that in earlier eras also he is the Creator. vikrameNa is not always 'by valorousness' but 'just by 
contemplation...' He can create, rather evolve from his within, because he is mahaa yashaH 'glorious...' 
since Veda-s say eko ha vai naaraayaNa, paraa asya shakti, etasya vaa a ksharasya How a 
single being can do all 
these thing? For this it is said saH shreSThaH puruSaH 'he is more than, better than, transcendent, 
to humans...' but not 'best among men' as routinely said above. The word punaH 'again' is used twice, 
one belongs to the earlier dissolutions and creations and another to the forthcoming ones. Tiirtha.

Shlok 27: "Oh, Dashagriiva, it is impossible to conquer that Rama in war for your, either singly or along with 
the hosts of the demon-supporters of yours, as one heaven cannot be won by many sinners. [3-31-27]

[Commentary] Ravana may question this spy as, 'When I am a ten-headed-demon, and he is single headed-human, why cannot 
I conquer him? The reply is 'you cannot, because you have only ten heads whereas each of the two brothers 
has sahasra shiirSaa puruSa, sahasra aksha... 'thousands of heads and thousands of eyes...' They are 
invincible whether you attack him singly or along with hosts of other sinister demons of your like, 
namely Namuchi, Hiranayakashyapa, Shambara et al. No one can conquer him. The analogy is like this. 
Though there are many sinners in many worlds, all put together are not able to conquer one single heaven.

Shlok 28: "I do not think that he is killable even for all god and demons, and this is the idea to kill him, and 
to this you may listen attentively. [3-31-28]

[Commentary] The 'gods and demons...' is said in plural, deva asuraiH even then sarva 'all' is also incorporated. 
This is to say that even in the forthcoming eras also he is invincible. Then the spy says an unasked 
for opinion, aham manye: ----  'I admit... that he is unkillable... though I belong to the clan of demons, 
on seeing Rama's valour in person, some wisdom dawned on me by the merit of my earlier births, but you 
are not able to open your eyes as yet, because you are still a stupid...' aasuriim yonim aapanaa muuDhaa

[Commentary] Sage Valmiki is speaking through the tongue of this Akampana, the spy, about the invincibility of Rama. 
Govindaraja.

Shlok 29: "An excellent woman in the world is there, a youthful one with symmetrical limbs, a jewel-like lady 
adorned with jewellery, that slender-waisted one who is known as Seetha is his wife. [3-31-29]

Shlok 30: "No goddess can be likened to that mature lady; a gandharva female - no; a apsara female - no; a pannaga 
female -no, then how can there be a woman of her like? [3-31-30]

Shlok 31: "You forcefully abduct his wife when she is in solitude, and indeed Rama will not exist reft of Seetha." 
Akampana advised Ravana in this way. [3-31-31]

[Commentary] Govindaraja says that this Akampana is talking like an enlightened sage, and Maheshvara Tiirtha says 
that a divine wisdom has dawned on this spy just now. Then the question that arises is: How a sagacious 
spy prompted Ravana to abduct Seetha? There are two answers for this.

[Commentary] 1. Any employee is a half-slave to his master, artha daasaa janaaH sarve as the money paid makes one 
a slave of the payer. This spy prompted Ravana in that way because he knows that Ravana is womaniser. 
Like-king-like-subjects yathaa raajaa tathaa prajaaH thus great-demons think alike. Further Ravana did 
not ask for the triggering point for the elimination of these many demons. If Ravana questions about 
it, Akampana had to say that Ravana's own sister Shuurpanakha wanted to debauch. Then Ravana's rage 
multiplies and he may even kill Akampana.

[Commentary] 2. All the sages, including Agastya, have declared to Rama that they have planned to bring Rama to Janasthaana 
only to eliminate the demons at Janasthaana and going further from Janasthaana to Lanka and eliminating 
Ravana is Rama's headache. Which happens owing to Seetha. aaniitaH 
tvam imam desham upaayena maharShibhiH || 3-30-35 Thus this sagacious Akampana is plotting 
to bring Seetha firstly, for whom Rama comes conquering Ravana, and then the demons on earth will be 
eradicated. Without Janasthaana Lanka is nothing but an open-door castle. So, the sages paved way for 
Rama through Janasthaana to Lanka.

Shlok 32: The chief of demons Ravana favouring that idea thought of it and that mighty armed Ravana then spoke 
to Akampana. [3-31-32]

Shlok 33: "Agreed! I wish to go alone early in the morning with a charioteer and I delightfully wish to lead Vaidehi 
into the elegant city Lanka." Ravana declared that way. [3-31-33]

Shlok 34: Saying so Ravana journeyed in a chariot that is yoked with mule-like horses, and that has the dazzling 
of the sun, whereby all the directions are made to glitter. [3-31-34]

Shlok 35: That opalescent chariot of the lord of demons while speedily progressing through starry way shone forth 
as if it is the moon in clouds. [3-31-35]

Shlok 36: On going to the hermitage of Maareecha which is at a distant place Maareecha the son of Tataka received 
Ravana and venerated that king of demons with sweetmeats and savouries that are unavailable to humans. 
[3-31-36]

[Commentary] The food items bhakshya are the supplementary items like laddu-s, jilebi, etc., and the like, whereas 
the bhojya items are boiled-rice, wheat-bread etc., the staple food items. The word a+maanuSaiH may 
also mean 'inhuman' but nowhere we find Ravana taking such a lowly food.

Shlok 37: Offering proper seat and water for washing feet and hands Maareecha personally attended Ravana and spoke 
to him this sentence that is worded meaningfully. [3-31-37]

Shlok 38: "Oh, king and supremo of demons, I am anxious to know whether everything safe and secure to the inhabitants 
of your kingdom, for I am not in the know of the reason by which now you have come here rushingly. [3-31-38]

Shlok 39: When Maareecha said so to him that greatly radiant one who is a sententious speaker that Ravana thereafter 
spoke this sentence. [3-31-39]

Shlok 40: "Oh, sire, Rama who is indefatigable in warring has ruined my security stationed at Janasthaana, and 
in war he even brought down all of Janasthaana which is undefeatable so far, such as I am, to me you 
have to render friendly help in kidnapping Rama's wife." [3-31-40]

Shlok 41a- 42: On hearing the words of that chief of demons, Maareecha spoke these words, "who broached the subject 
of Seetha with you, an enemy in the fakery of a friend? Oh, tigerly demon, who is that censurable one 
that is unhappy with you, since he is giving such a self-ruinous advise? [3-31-42]

Shlok 43: " 'Seetha may be brought to Lanka...' who said it, say him to me, who is that one desiring to cut off 
the prominence of all the demons in all worlds in saying so?



"Who is desirous of getting a zenithal demon ruling all the three worlds to be cut-off when he said 
that Seetha shall be brought to Lanka?



"Who is saying that Seetha is to be brought to Lanka with a desire to get your apogeal ten-heads that 
are prominent among all the clansmen of demons to be cut-off? [3-31-43]

Shlok 44: "Also, he who has motivated you in this way is an undoubted enemy of yours, for he wanted to extricate 
the fangs of a snake from its mouth, of course, through you. [3-31-44]

Shlok 45: "By whom and by which purpose of his you are made to blunder upon this awry path, oh, king, it is as 
good as his hitting hard on your head while you are fast asleep. [3-31-45]

Shlok 46: "Oh, Ravana, it will be unbefitting to raise an eye to see Rama in war, who will be then like a majestic 
elephant that has an impeccable dynasty and bloodline as its mammoth trunk, personal radiance as its 
indomitable might, very firm pair of arms as its pernicious tusks, more so, who will be with the redolence 
of the irrepressible lineage of Raghava-s. [3-31-46]

Shlok 47: "To be in the midst of war itself is the fury of that lion called Rama, by which that lion raises its 
tail touching the back of its trunk, that lion is all-inclusive with forelegs, paws, and claws that 
are included in arrows, while its fangs are swords, and it is the killer of the deer called the expert 
killer-demons, and mind you, do not dare to rouse that sleeping man-lion. [3-31-47]

[Commentary] The nara-simha, man-lion incarnation is suggested here.

Shlok 48: "His bow is crocodilian, his shoulder-speed is quagmire, his arrows are tidal, and the great immensity 
of his war itself is a tideland, and oh, king of demons, it is inapt of you to slide down into the much-ghoulish 
mouth of that abyssal ocean, called Rama. [3-31-48]

[Commentary] The crocodile catches at the very moment of falling of its prey, the arrows make one to sink into a 
quagmire without any hope of coming up, and when the arrows once discharged tidally, the battlefield 
becomes a tideland inundated with his arrows. Thus, it is impossible to crossover that oceanic netherworld, 
called Rama. Tiirtha.

Shlok 49: "Oh, lord of Lanka, be appeased towards Rama, be quietened and gently proceed to Lanka. You take delight 
in your wives, and let Rama be delighting with wife in forests." Thus Mareecha spoke to Ravana. [3-31-49]

[Commentary] Suffix: 'forgive what has happened, remit a disastrous war on Lanka, be pleased with what you have and 
be content with it, holdback your greediness...'

Shlok 50: When thus said by Maareecha that ten faced Ravana returned to his city Lanka and entered his best house 
and home. [3-31-50]

[Commentary] This chapter is a scarecrow to the aesthetics of Ramayana and 
a milestone to commentators of Ramayana. We usually find in Ramayana spectacular entrances for cities, 
characters, and situations. Before such a fantastic entrance of Ravana, for which a full sarga/chapter 
is allotted, this chapter is said to be a glaring hurdle. In here, this Akampana is glorified as a sagacious 
person, yet he gives advise to Ravana to abduct Seetha. This advice is said to contain the setting of 
the ultimate war-field in Lanka. But, the weight of the very same advise by Shuurpanakha is lost to 
this of a spy. Shuurpanakha's intent is very clear, but the meaning, purpose and the achievement of 
this spy is very unclear, except to that which is said by commentators.

[Commentary] Ravana on going to Maareecha, and hearing all indirect puraNa-s 
'mythologies...' returns to Lanka as a gentleman. If he were to be this gentle, Ramayana would not be 
there. But Maheshvara Tiirtha, the commentator says:
ata eva 
raavaNasya siitaa raama bhR^ityatvena taa uddisya tena vakShyamaaNaani baahya dR^iShTyaa durbhaaShaNa 
vat pratiiyamaanaani api vaakyaani - - vastutaH stuti paraaNi eva  'Though the utterances 
of Ravana apparently mean as vile, but their subtext is that of a devotee of Vishnu. -- Maheshvara 
Tiirtha

[Commentary] If Ravana is a true devotee, basing on many mythologies and sub-mythologies, 
the way in which he treated Seetha in Lanka is evident and it pictures him as a clear-cut villain. Thus 
says another commentator, namely Rama Tilaka, whose aim is to elicit literary values of Ramayana, 
and who dismisses all 
this hyperboling. Whether this chapter is interpolated or original, this is included in traditional versions, and 
hence it is to be sincerely incorporated here, because commentators have said a lot about it. So goes the 
tradition.



SARGA 32
------------------------------

[Text] The pomp and pageantry of Ravana is portrayed along with his idiosyncrasy and individuality, his triumphs 
and victories, his jalousies and covetousness. Shuurpanakha approaches him to inform of her fate at 
the hand of Lakshmana.

Shlok 1- 2: On seeing the fourteen thousands demons of heinous crimes, and even on seeing Trishira, Duushana, and 
even Khara, who are all exterminated by lone Rama, then Shuurpanakha emitted a thunderous blare like 
a thundercloud. [3-32-1, 2]

Shlok 3: Highly agitated to witness the deed done by Rama, which deed is highly impossible for others, she hurried 
Lanka ruled by Ravana. [3-32-3]

Shlok 4: She saw Ravana who is fulgent with his own radiance, seated with ministers at his nearby in the midst 
of the divine aircraft Pushpaka, as with Indra who will be sitting amidst wind-gods. [3-32-4]

[Commentary] The place where Ravana is sitting can be said as 'at the top floor of a multi-storeyed building...' 
as the word vimaana means 'atop...' of a house, temple-towers etc. But it can also be said Pushpaka 
aircraft as said in Dharmaakuutam: tatra 
ca vicitra vimaana madhyage kaancana maya aasane - -

[Commentary] The words upa upa viSTa 'the ministers are sitting near him, and are in attendance upon him...' by the 
use of extra preposition upa, but in the course of time the idea of 'nearness or proximity' are lost 
and it came be used as just 'sitting...' Thus, the tautological tendencies were influencing Sanskrit' 
- Pt. Satya Vrat in Ramayana - A Linguistic Study.

Shlok 5: Seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Altar of 
Fire, and he himself resembling the blazing Ritual-fire spurting out of it when that Golden-Fire-Altar 
is drenched with plentiful ghee, she saw such a Ravana. [3-32-5]

[Commentary] Ravana is seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden 
Fire-altar, laid with golden bricks. Mud-bricks will be used in Vedic-rituals in ordinary fashion, while 
he is a special fire in a special golden altar. When much ghee is poured into that Golden-Fire-Altar 
continually, it is natural for the fire to blurt up, so also Ravana is flaring up when his needs are 
oblated in that fire, and his glow is heightening with every pour of ghee-oblation, rather fulfilment 
of each need.

[Commentary] On conquering all the worlds Ravana assumed indratva 'Indra-hood.' So all the oblations in rituals shall 
belong to Ravana. Any ritual other than this variety will be hindered or spoiled by this demon group. 
This is the real problem of all the celestials, as they are not getting their due of oblations through 
Vedic-rituals. Ravana's throne, rather the seat of authority, itself is the Golden-Ritual-Altar of its 
kind, and every praise, or extolment of Ravana is a hymn in his eulogy, and any offering made anywhere 
in his jurisdiction is an offering made into that Ravana-Fire-Altar. That absolute power of Ravana is 
making him to glow to the bedazzlement of all the worlds. And how he got that Indrahood is said next.

Shlok 6: An invincible one either for gods or gandharva-s, or to sages with exalted souls, or even to any other 
entity worth its name, whose appearance itself is catastrophic, and who is sitting identical to the 
Terminator, as though that Terminator himself is sitting with a wide gaped mouth, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha 
saw. [3-32-6]

Shlok 7: One who is severally bruised in several combats of gods and demons with the thunderbolts from the Vajra 
weapon of Indra, and one who is severally blotched on his chest when the prongs of the tusks of Airavata, 
the lordly elephant of Indra, gored his chest, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-7]

Shlok 8: One who has twenty arms, ten faces and a broad chest, and a possessor of all regalia of Indra like white 
parasol, white fanning instruments, colours and the like insigne, and at that brave one who is attributed 
with all of the kingly attributes, Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-8]

[Commentary] Ravana is said to have four legs also in naaradiiya jaimini Ramayana: dasha aasyam viMshati bhujam bhinna 
anjana cayamopamam | paadaiH catur ati ugram taamroSTam 11 chapter, 75 verse. In Raghuvamsha in 18th 
chapter bhujamuurthoru baahulyaa dekopidhana daanuja etc., but not vividly portrayed elsewhere.

Shlok 9: Blent with the gleam of Lapis gems studded in his ornaments his glisten is alike that gem, while 
his ear-knobs are made out of refined gold, and his arms strongish, teeth whitish, mouth widish and 
he is mountainous, and Shuurpanakha saw such a Ravana. [3-32-9]

Shlok 10: His body bears hundreds of welts caused when assaulted with Vishnu-disc for hundreds of times in wars 
with gods, and when assaulted for hundreds of times with the other assaults-missiles in other gruesome 
wars as well, and Shuurpanakha saw at such a Ravana. [3-32-10]

[Commentary] The disc of Vishnu here does not mean the sudarshana cakra of Vishnu. This is yet another missile which 
is one among many given to Rama by Vishvamitra. This sudarshana cakra is a 'thought of Vishnu to eliminate 
the vice...' sankalpa, a conceptually symbolic missile in one of his hands. But in the core of its essence 
it is no disc with any sprockets and central thumb-hole etc.
praaNo mayaa 
kriyaa shaktiH | bhaava unmeSha udyamaH | sudarshanam ca sa~NkalpaH | shabdaa paryaaya vaacakaaH -- 
ahirbuj~na vaakya 'sudarshana is my causative thinking, words are just alternatives --  ahirbudhnya aphorisms. This narration is to portray that Ravana has war-wounds on all over his limbs. 
Though hit by Thunderbolts or missiles for umpteen times, he is just wounded but not dead and he is 
on such a winning spree, ineradicably.

Shlok 11: Likewise, whose limbs are thrashed with thrashing missilery of all gods, whereby his body and soul have 
become harsh, thus he can perpetrate anything swiftly at his will, and he who can capably roil an un-perturbable 
ocean at his wish, at such Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-11]

Shlok 12: At him who is a volleyer of mountain peaks, a represser of gods, an extirpator of ethical values, and 
a molester of others wives, Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: He who is a marksman of every divine missile, and an ever interdictor of Vedic-rituals, and who on going 
to the city named Bhogavati, the capital of Naga-s, and on defeating Vaasuki, the King of Serpents, 
has abducted the dear wife of Taksha on molesting her, and Shuurpanakha saw such a molester of others 
wives. [3-32-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: On going to Mt. Kailash he who has defeated the god who uses humans as his vehicle, namely Kubera, and 
snatched away his aircraft, namely Pushpaka, which aircraft transits at the wish of its steersman, and 
Shuurpanakha saw such a grabber of others possessions. [3-32-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: He who enviously devastated the divine gardens of Kubera, called Caitraratha, along with a divine Lake 
of Lotuses pertaining to the same Kubera, called Pushkarini, and the gardens of Indra, called Nandana, 
along with other paradisiacal gardens of gods, Shuurpanakha saw such an envious demon. [3-32-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Shuurpanakha saw him who is similar to the pinnacle of a mountain, and who with his two hands 
forestalls the highly propitious ones that are the stiflers of their enemies, namely the Sun and Moon, when they tend to 
rise. [3-32-16b, 17a]

[Commentary] Tall as a hill that cleaves the sky, / He raised his mighty arms on high / To check the blessed moon, 
and stay / The rising of the Lord of Day. - Griffith.

Shlok 17b- 18a: That courageous one who in early times has practised ascesis for ten thousand years in a great-forest, 
and who on accomplishing it has dedicated ten of his heads to the Self-Created Brahma, she saw such 
a Ravana with such ten heads. [3-32-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Whereby, to whom there is an indemnity against death in war at the hand of gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
devils, birds, or reptiles, excepting humans, and Shuurpanakha saw such an unimperilled Ravana. [3-32-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: He who is an extreme-ultraist that expropriates the Soma-juice-oblation form the vessels of oblation 
in Vedic-rituals, which Soma juice-oblation is blest with Vedic-hymns and kept separately by Vedic Brahmans, 
since it is intended and shall belong to Indra and other divinities, and she saw such a plunderer. [3-32-19b, 
20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: He who is such an embezzler of the Vedic-rituals at the time of their culmination, a malicious one, 
and one with cruel acts, a hinderer of Vedic-rituals, or, the slayer of those Brahmans that conduct 
Vedic-rituals contrary to his wishes, and one who is heartless and a rampant demon, who is a delighter 
in the iniquity to the people, at him Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] The problem with Ravana is that nobody shall surpass him or his boons, by conducting various Vedic-rituals, 
appeasing various gods to get better boons, or say 'a boon to kill Ravana' itself. That being his preconceived 
fear he lets none to conduct any Vedic sacrifice. Secondly, he has became one with Indra with the boon 
of Brahma. So, any ritual should be centred on Ravana, not Indra. He is not a routine Brahman slayer 
as he has Brahmanic origin, and his teachers are Brahmans, and the like. But he goes against those Brahmans 
who dare to conduct rituals for Indra and other divinities.

Shlok 21b- 22a: She that demoness Shuurpanakha saw her brother who makes all beings to wail, an alarming one to all 
the worlds, an atrocious one and highly formidable Ravana. [3-32-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] Ravana is the nickname of Dashagriiva, or Dashakantha, or Dashaanana, or Dashakandhara. When Ravana 
tried to lift up Mt. Kailash with his twenty hands, on which Shiva, Parvati, Nandi, and a host of 
pramatha 
gaNa-s are there, Shiva pressed down the Mt. Kailash with his big toe. Then Ravana's twenty hands went 
under Mt. Kailash ehereby he started to yell in pain for a thousand years, terrifying all the worlds. Then, 
as advised by his ministers Ravana extols Shiva in a stotram, danDakam a rhythmical eulogy. That heavily 
worded eulogy is still available in the name of raavaNa kR^ita daNDaka. Then, Shiva releases Ravana's 
hands from under Mt. Kailash and blesses him to be renowned as 'Ravana' then onward. This will be in 
the uttara ramayaNa seventh book. Thus, Ravana is the etymological derivation of the word from the root 
ru 'to make noise or weep...'

[Commentary] The mantra shastra says:-- 

 raama patniim
vanasthaam ninaaya - iti raavaNa 'one who abducted Rama's wife from woodlands...' In another way it is 
raavaNasya 
apatyam pumaan raavaNaH 'Ravana's son is Raavana.'

Shlok 22b- 23a: And at him who is conspicuously sitting on a throne, attired and bejewelled in excellent apparels and 
jewels, shining forth with marvellous garlands, and who is like the Ultimate-Time on the rise destined 
for the Eventual-Time. [3-32-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24: Demoness Shuurpanakha nearing Ravana, who is the highly fortunate king of demons, an enemy-destroyer 
and a felicity of the dynasty of Sage Pulasta, and who is now surrounded by his ministers, she spoke 
this sentence. [3-32-23b, 24]

Shlok 25: She who is disfigured by the high souled Lakshmana, and who is still perplexed with the fear of Lakshmana 
and her own craving for Rama as well, on displaying her misfortune to everybody that fearless rover 
Shuurpanakha spoke this very caustic sentence to Ravana, whose eyes are broad and burning. [3-32-25]



SARGA 33
------------------------------

[Text] Shuurpanakha taunts Ravana for his un-kingly activities, by which his kingdom is going to 
			face a calamitous situation soon. While gibing at him she narrates how a king, really fit 
			for kingship, shall conduct the affairs of kingdom. She speaks many paradigms on which many 
			commentaries are declined basing on kings and their vices.



This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and 
			his kingship. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with
			raaja niiti shastra 'political science' and there in Kishkindha the only 
			rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in 
			here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shuurpanakha. Though Shuurpanakha 
			is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue 
			in forewarning Ravana.

Shlok 1: Then that doleful Shuurpanakha spoke these scornful words to Ravana who makes the world to wail in the 
presence of his ministers. [3-33-1]

Shlok 2: "Highly infatuated with lustful gratifications you are incontinent and unchecked, thus you are unobservant 
of a calamitous jeopardy that has surfaced, though you ought to be observant of it as a king. [3-33-2]

Shlok 3: "If a king deports himself in an overly self-assured manner, that too with self-serving motives, and 
clings only to dirty pleasures, he will be unhonoured by people as with a crematory fire. [3-33-3]

[Commentary] For those who are self-centred there will be no fear, no shame.
artha aaturaaNaam 
na gurur na bandhuH | kaama aaturaaNaam na bhayam na lajja | kShudha aaturaaNaam na rucir na pakvam 
| vidya aaturaa Naam na sukham na nidraa -- niiti shaastra 'for money-mongers no venerable 
ones, no relative... for lust-mongers no fear, no shame... for food-mongers no taste, no proper baking... 
for education-mongers, no comfort, no sleep...' morals.

Shlok 4: "The king who will not deal with the concerns of kingdom, in person and on time, he and his kingdom 
and even those concerns of his kingdom will get ruined. [3-33-4]

[Commentary] This can also be expressed as: ssaH taiH kaaryaiH saha raajyena ca vinashyati '...by those very issues 
of kingdom, the king along with his kingdom gets ruined...' because the major issue on hand is Rama 
and Lakshmana and they can ruin Ravana and his kingdom. Inordinate revelling in comforts and lust makes 
a king weak in body, mind, and time. The timely actions he is supposed to take do not come to mind because 
mind is weakened and benumbed. Then he is liable to believe his aids that may precisely land him into 
further troubles. Hence a king / ruler has to take actions and decisions personally, on time, duly remaining 
firm by his body and mind.

Shlok 5: "If a king is inaccessible to spies for exchange of information, unavailable for subjects for an audience 
for a similar appraisal, more so if he is intemperately not able to impose self-discipline, people will 
eschew such a king from a distance as elephants will refrain themselves from the mud of river from a 
distance. [3-33-5]

[Commentary] Shuurpanakha knows that Ravana has spies all around, but she is also in the know that they are worthless 
fellows because they narrate mythologies after every thing is ruined, as was done by Akampana in the 
previous episode. There is none to caution him beforehand excepting herself, that is her confidence. 
So, she is haranguing Ravana to take immediate action, otherwise, there may be a mutiny or cold war 
in his kingdom, and his subjects may desert him during wartime, like Vibheeshana.

Shlok 6: "Which of those kings that will not safeguard their kingdoms by remaining in a self-restrained manner, 
they will not outshine advantageously, like mountains submerged under ocean. [3-33-6]



"Without keeping the kingdom under your personal control, you have shuffled the administration onto 
the ministers and army personnel like Khara, Duushana et al. And these figureheads alone become the 
tiderips, for they quarrel among themselves about the kingship of Lanka after your ruin, and they alone 
are floating like oceanic tides up above your head and thus you are a submerged sovereign. In any way, 
your doom is destined either by Rama, who is an imminent danger, or by your military managers, who are 
the in-built dangers."

[Commentary] Ravana is no doubt mountainous in his wealth and prosperity but he is engulfed in the ocean called promiscuity, 
and as long as those waters of lust tiderip over his head he cannot surface himself.

Shlok 7: "Externally you are belligerent with sensible gods, gandharva-s and other demons, and internally you 
are needful of intelligence agents, and such as you are, you are an erratic even, then how can you thrive 
as a king! [3-33-7]

[Commentary] Your enmity with the sensible gods will make them sensitive to be vigilant. And because there is a lack 
of intelligence or agents to you, added to it there is a lack of your own personal intelligence required 
for a king, and above all there is a lacking in the insistence of real kingship with you. Then, will 
not those gods take opportunity to hit you back, for everything is lacking in you, except lusting?'

Shlok 8: "Your bent is boyish and you are mindless, oh, demon, you are not able to know the knowable danger because 
you are carefree, and how do you thrive as a king! [3-33-8]

Shlok 9: "Oh, so-called best one among triumphant kings, those kings that do not retain spies, treasuries and 
strategies under their control, but vouchsafe them to others, they are of a piece with the peasantry. 
[3-33-9]

Shlok 10: "Oh, titular overlord of humans, only some can be called prescient kings because they see all the situations 
happening distantly through their spies. [3-33-10]

[Commentary] Though the spies bring in various pieces of information they are to be collated and analysed by the 
king. anena caareNa vyavahitaa api arthaa avashyam vicaaraNiiyaa iti suucitam - dk  
'so you neither have those intelligent spies nor the least intelligence required of a 'prescient 
king' thus your doom is certain.'

Shlok 11: "I believe that you have no spies worth their profession, yet you are associated with artless ministers 
worthy to worship you, hence you are incognisant of the ruination of all of your subjects in Janasthaana, 
including Janasthaana. [3-33-11]

Shlok 12: "A single soul called Rama has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of dreadful deeds in Janasthaana, 
even Duushana is killed, even Khara is also killed. [3-33-12]

Shlok 13: "That indefatigable champion Rama gave security to the sages, rendered Dandaka forest safeguarded, and 
he put Janasthaana to rout. [3-33-13]

Shlok 14: "On your part you are but selfish, hotheaded, and others like the appeasers of your lust, or these artless 
ministers, or those underpaid unfaithful spies hold you down, and such as you are, you are unperceptive 
of the calamity rising up against you in your own kingdom. [3-33-14]

Shlok 15: "Should a king be overweening, an under-payer, an improvident, self-conceited, and dubious, all his 
subjects bid goodbye to such a king when he is in strife. [3-33-15]

Shlok 16: "Should a ruler be unduly self-conceited, self-centred, self-adulating and a spitfire too, his own kith 
and kin will ruin him when he is in distress. [3-33-16]

Shlok 17: "That king who does not officiate his good offices, nor un-panicked into panicky situations, he will 
be quickly overthrown from his kingdom, and on becoming a debased individual he will be equated with 
a piece of straw in this world. [3-33-17]

Shlok 18: "Dried sticks, globs or the particles of dust are of some avail, but kings fallen from their position 
are of no avail. [3-33-18]

Shlok 19: "As to how a used up raiment or a crumpled flower-tassel is meaningless, likewise a king derelict from 
his kingdom, though functional, is meaningless. [3-33-19]

Shlok 20: "Which king will be cautious, clever, conscientious, with his controlled senses, and thankful, that 
king survives for a long time. [3-33-20]

Shlok 21: "He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness will be wakeful even though he slept well closing his physical 
eyes and he who will make his fury and favour evident to people without any concealment or cunningness, 
people will highly revere him as a king.



"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness wakeful even though he sleeps fast closing his physical eyes, 
thus discarded are his fury and frenzy as well, because he knows as to who is to be treated furiously 
and who is to be favoured, and thus people will revere him as a judicious king. [3-33-21]

Shlok 22: "But, oh, Ravana, because you are imprudent you are bereft of these merits, and such as you are, unknown 
is the very great massacre of demons to you, though not personally, but at least through your spies. 
[3-33-22]

Shlok 23: "You are the humiliator of others, you hobnob only with your ravishes, and incognisant of the object 
for apportionment of time and place for your activities, as to when and where and how the things are 
to be dealt with. And, as you are not attending any kingly activity, or do not focus your mind in deciding 
rights and wrongs, thereby your kingdom will get ruined and you will be imperilled, not before long." 
Thus Shuurpanakha declaimed Ravana about his worthlessness as a king. [3-33-23]

[Commentary] However self-sufficient and self-assured a king might be, he cannot underestimate rivalling kings as 
trivial, unilaterally. anena susamR^iddha raajyastho api raajaa etaiH doSaiH aciraat raajya 
bhrSTo bhavati iti - raaj~naa baliSTena api shatru durbala iti avamatiH na kartavyam ca suucitam - 
dk   It is indicated that a king should 
be on his guard lest he will be overthrown, just because that king is associated with many un-kingly 
attitudes.

Shlok 24: In this way when Shuurpanakha extolled only his negative traits, he that lord of night-walkers Ravana, 
who holds only his pride, power and prosperity dear to him, pored them over in his mind and contemplated 
over a time. [3-33-24]



SARGA 34
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana enquires about Rama's valour and weaponry for which Shuurpanakha narrates about Rama, Seetha, 
and Lakshmana and what has happened in Janasthaana. Thus she prompts Ravana to achieve Seetha as his 
wife, for none surpasses Seetha in her beauty.

Shlok 1: On observing Shuurpanakha who is speaking bitter words against him in the presence of ministers then 
Ravana is highly infuriated and queried her. [1-34-1]

Shlok 2: "Who is Rama? How brave he is? Of what mien and what calibre he is? And for what reason he entered the 
highly inscrutable Dandaka forest? [1-34-2]

[Commentary] 'Why this Rama has to come this far to Dandaka instead of loitering somewhere near Himalayas? Has he 
come purposefully with any revenge against us, the demons, or is it a pleasure-trip? Why should he leave 
his ancestral kingdom and enter Dandaka, a stronghold of demons?' This is the real worry of Ravana.
kena ca kaaraNena kula parampara aagatam praajyam raajyam parityajya nikhila nishaacara vaaso asmin 
deshe samaagataH - dk Ravana might be unaware that Dandaka forest also belongs to Ikshvaku-s as 
Kishkindha belonged to them, as said by Rama at the time of eliminating of Vali.

Shlok 3- 4a: "What is the weapon of that Rama by whom these many demons are killed in war, likewise Duushana and 
Trishira are killed, and even the unkillable Khara is killed? Oh, lady with fascinating limbs, who disfigured 
you? That you tell. [1-34-3, 4a]

[Commentary] This can be simple question 'What is his weapon?' without telling round about as above. But Ravana is 
weighing arsenal balance since he is self-content with a giant-robot namely Kumbhakarna, and with a 
brave and all-trickster son Indrajit, along with his own ICBMs, ASMs and ASMs, plus his own invincibility. 
Thereby he is said to be puzzled at arsenal-less Rama and asking:
kaani kaani 
ca aayudhaani khara mukha nishaacra praaNa haani karaaNi - dk'you said that Rama caused 
this havoc single-handedly, then he should have used various and numerous weapons by which missiles 
are flung... because common sense does not permit any belief that a handheld bow can dart numerous arrows 
or missile, that too when wielded by a single human...'

Shlok 4b- 5a: When the king of demons has asked her thus, she that demoness Shuurpanakha who is in a fit of fury then 
commenced to describe Rama in the point of fact. [3-34-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: "Dasharatha's son Rama is the one with inescapable arms and keen-eyed, but has jute-cloths and skin 
of black-deer for his dress, yet in semblance he is similar to the Love-god. [3-34-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "Yanking out a bow with golden fillets, and that is similar to the bow of Indra in its shine, he strews 
candent iron-arrows that simulate snakes with deadly poison. [3-34-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "It has become imperceivable for me to me to see when and how he drew his ghastly arrows from quiver 
on the battleground; or, stretching his bow admitting those arrows on bowstring - no; or, his releasing 
those sharp edged arrows from the bow - no; why them, that great mighty Rama himself has become imperceptible 
in the fastness of his action. [3-34-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "As with a crop of grain devastated by a hailstorm of Indra, I could only see that best army while it 
is being annihilated with a downpour of arrows. [3-34-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: "Thus a lone foot-soldier with his excruciating arrows has exterminated fourteen thousand demons with 
fiendish might, including Duushana, and along withKhara, say, within one and half hours. [3-34-9b,10]

[Commentary] The above is consolidated and said as: saH ayam 
adhunaa muni jana samucita veShopi dhik kR^ita shakra paraakrame vikrameNa shakra kaarmuka sadR^ikSham 
caapam aakR^iShya mahaa viShaan aashii viShaan iva rukma punkhaan anukShaNam prakShipan rakSho vikShobhakaram 
ati bhayankaram ruupam aavahati - dk.

Shlok 11: "Accorded is the protection to the sages, and Dandaka is made as a snuggest place for them. I am the 
lone one somehow let off by such a high-minded Rama, of course, on humiliating me by cutting my nose 
and ears. Maybe, it is because he is hesitant of woman-slaughter for he is a well-versed soul. [1-34-11, 
12]

[Commentary] Here she twisted the story line to her side, as she edited the scene of her humiliation later to annihilation 
of their army. In Dandaka witch-hunting is over and it is calm and collected now. In fact, Ravana intruded 
into Janasthaana of Dandaka and stationed some army to protect intrusion into Lanka, as his mainstay 
is only the castled city Lanka. Now that the doors to Lanka are wide open Lanka is exposed to an imminent 
danger. nishaacaraan

Shlok 13: "A highly resplendent one who by his trait matches his brother in bravery, an adherent and a devotee 
of his brother, such a stout-hearted one is Rama's brother known as Lakshmana. [1-34-13]

Shlok 14: "That Lakshmana is an easily irritable one, he is not that easily invincible, an easy victor, but not 
an easygoing valiant, yet he is an intellectual at ease, and a mighty one who does not ease off, such 
a Lakshmana is the perpetual right-hand and the peripherally moving life of Rama. [1-34-14]

Shlok 15: "But, one with her broad-eyes, face similar to the full-moon is the dear and wedded wife of Rama, and 
she always takes delight in the well-being of her dear one, namely Rama. [1-34-15]

Shlok 16: "She is the one with lengthy hairdo, her nose and thighs are fine, and that glorious one with fine looks 
is the wife of Rama, and she is beaming forth like a sylvan deity situated in that woodland, who in 
turn is like Goddess Lakshmi in a temporal form. [1-34-16]

Shlok 17: "She has a complexion mathing the shade of refined gold, her nails are rosy and jutting, and she with 
her curvaceous hips and slim waist is the daughter of King of Videha, and known as Seetha. [1-34-17]

Shlok 18: "So far I have not seen any goddess with such a comeliness; a gandharva female - no; a yaksha female 
- no; a kinnara female - no; and a woman, no, not on the face of earth! [1-34-18]

Shlok 19: "To whom Seetha becomes a wife and around whom she gladly throws her arms after such a marriage, he 
lives more grandly than Indra in all the worlds. [1-34-19]

Shlok 20: "She is a highly gracious lady, laudable by her bodily structure, incomparable by her appearance, and 
she will become a seemly wife of yours, and you too will become a best husband of hers. [1-34-20]

Shlok 21- 22a: "Oh, mighty shouldered brother, but when I ventured to bring her as your wife, whose hips are broad, 
bosom fat and bulgy, face excellent, that cruel Lakshmana disfigured me. [1-34-21, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "You too will become a groveller at the arrows Lover-god in case you now see Vaidehi with a face shining 
like full-moon. [1-34-22, 23a]

Shlok 23b: "Hence, if you hatch an opinion to make her as your wife, and if you aspire success, now itself quickly 
put your best foot, namely your right foot, forward. [1-34-23]

Shlok 24: "Oh, the king of demons Ravana, if this advise of mine is pleasing to you, let this idea be actualised 
without any shilly-shallying in your mind. [1-34-24]

Shlok 25: "Oh, king of the demons, realise your stout-heartedness, and oh, great mighty one, let that immaculately 
limbed Seetha be abducted to become your wife. [1-34-25]

Shlok 26: "On recognising that Rama with his straight shooting arrows destroyed the night-walkers positioned at 
Janasthaana, and further on distinguishing that Duushana, and even Khara, is dispatched, it is apt of 
you to awake to a workable action." Thus Shuurpanakha has earbashed Ravana. [1-34-26]



SARGA 35
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana proceeds to Maareecha seeking his help in the abduction of Seetha. He travels by his aircraft-like 
chariot and on way he sees many locations along the seacoast that are affluent and divine. On seeing 
a banyan tree Ravana recollects the episode of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. He arrives at the hermitage 
of Maareecha.

Shlok 1: On hearing the exciting advise of Shuurpanakha then Ravana bade adieu to ministers, and indeed on resolving 
his further task he proceeded to his personal palace chambers. [3-35-1]

Shlok 2- 3: While following up his thinking about that task he got a pertinent thought, and on deliberating about 
the credits and discredits, strengths and weaknesses of that thought he decided that 'this is to be 
done in this method only.' On taking a decision in that way and with a firm mind he indeed proceeded 
to his excellent vehicle-garage. [3-35-2, 3]

Shlok 4: That lordly demon then has gone to the vehicle garage in secrecy, and directed the charioteer thus as, 
'let the chariot be harnessed.' [3-35-4]

[Commentary] This 'secretly going to his own garage...' is one among the many oddities of Ravana that is suggested 
here. Kings never go to stables or garages but horses or chariots come to their fore, if ordered. Ravana's 
ministers have heard Shuurpanakha's report about the destruction of all the demons in Janasthaana. Because 
they have heard, it will not remain a secret or suppressible fact, but it will spread as a wild fire. 
Then some action has become necessary for Ravana now to save his face. praaNam eva parityajya maanam 
eva abhirakshatu 'Let life go but not the self-respect...' So, his first thinking is to wage a 
war with Rama, but it may become a worthless expedition because Rama's capabilities are partially known. 
Next, he thought to abduct Seetha, for she is said not only to be beautiful but a dearly cherished wife 
of Rama. If Seetha is distracted from Rama, Rama may die anguishing for Seetha, thus this imminent danger, 
called Rama, gets ruined once for all.

[Commentary] The human nature is bhaaryaa duHkham punar bhaaryaa just 'to lament for a parted wife for some 
time till a second wife is secured...' Thus, that wife-addict Rama will lament for Seetha for some time 
and seeks another woman as his wife. Instead, if he starts searching for Seetha alone, it is impossible 
for those two young humans to come searching this far, or to cross the ocean, or to enter Lanka. And 
even on entering Lanka, it is impossible to survive further at the hands of demons. These are some of 
the many of his deliberations on the 'strengths and weaknesses and the credits and discredits...' of 
his thought mentioned in the verse.

[Commentary] Then he enters his beautiful vehicle garage secretly. Why a king shall behave this quirkily? Because 
'walls have ears...' and what all Shuurpanakha barked in the court must be audible throughout the palace 
by now, or may be all over Lanka, and if someone sees Ravana's exit at this point of time, everyone 
despises him, on the charge that he is trying to bring yet another woman. Though it is not said vividly 
here, that he is going to abduct Seetha thievishly keeping his valour and bravery aside, this will be 
made known in the words of Kumbhakarna in Yuddha Kaanda. This is shameful for his own self, as he did 
not do this way on previous occasions. For such a cowardly act, even Ravana's cherished wife Mandodari 
may despise or deride Ravana. So, he came to stables with a quirk of secrecy, which of course, will 
not remain a secret, soon.

Shlok 5: When that brisk-paced charioteer is said in this way he instantly harnessed the favourite and choicest 
chariot of Ravana with horses and got it ready. [3-35-5]

Shlok 6: That chariot which is decorated with golden ornaments, yoked with monster-faced mules that have gem 
studded trappings is rideable by the wish of the rider, and sitting in such a chariot which is wholly 
golden and which rides with a sound like the pealing of thunder, that celebrated Ravana, the brother 
of Kubera and the lord of demons, travelled towards the lord of rivers and rivulets, namely the ocean. 
[3-35-6,7]

Shlok 8: Dasha-aanana, the decahedral demon, whose complexion like the smoothened Lapis-gem is lustrous, whose 
regalia that comprise white long-furred fans, white parasol and the like is spectacular, whose ornaments 
made out of refined gold are glittering, who similar to a kingly mountain with ten pinnacles and crags 
by way of his ten heads and twenty arms is gorgeous, and such a chief of demons who by that way is an 
adversary of gods and cutthroat of eminent-sages, seated in a nitid golden chariot that is rideable 
by the wish of its steersman, he shone forth like a black-cloud fringed with the streaks of lightning 
and rimmed with flights of cranes. [3-35-8, 9, 10]

[Commentary] Here the cloud metaphors with Ravana, the streaks of lightning with the silvery flashes of his regalia, 
and the decorated chariot with the flight of cranes.

Shlok 11: That dauntless Ravana forged ahead while viewing the area along the coastline which is interspersed 
with thousands of mountains and which is with variously flowered and fruited trees. [3-35-11]

Shlok 12: Everywhere the coastland is bedecked with lotus-lakes containing clean and cool waters, and with extensive 
thresholds of hermitages containing Fire-altars. [3-35-12]

Shlok 13: Entire coast is gleaming with banana plantation and glistening with coconut trees, and the saala, palm, 
and tamaala trees are also in full blossom. [3-35-13]

Shlok 14: It is brightened up with thousands of reptiles and birds, with those many celestial beings that frequent 
the earth like gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s. And with eminent sages who have highly controlled food-habits, 
as well. It is also refulgent with the self-denying Siddha-s, Carana-s, and with sages that are the 
brainchildren of Brahma, namely Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s. [3-35-14, 15]

[Commentary] The details about these sages are given in the 6th chapter of this Aranya Kanda when these categories 
of sages meet Rama requesting protection from demons.

Shlok 16: With thousands of celestial maidens divine in their mien, namely apsara-s, who are prettified with divine 
ornaments and garlands, and who are also the experts in the methodical sex-games that seaside is pervaded. 
[3-35-16]

Shlok 17: That seacoast is adored by the propitious wives of gods and frequented by the assemblages of gods who 
thrive upon ambrosia, and even patronised by demons that strive for ambrosia. [3-35-17]

[Commentary] The demons did not get their share of amR^ita 'divine elixir' therefore they cannot be called
amR^ita ashibhiH 'ambrosia consumers.' As such, some other mms contain this expression 
amR^ita arthibhiH 'desirers of ambrosia...' the demons. They also frequent those coasts along with 
gods.

Shlok 18: It is spread with swans, ruddy-gees and frogs, and there the waterfowls are very noisy, and stones overlain 
on the coast are like lapis-gems, and with the ambience of ocean that whole delta is appearing smooth 
and sludgy. [3-35-18]

Shlok 19- 20: While Ravana, the brother of Kubera, is quickly transiting he saw everywhere the whitish and widish 
aircrafts belonging to the deified souls who acquired higher worlds, and from those aircrafts adorned 
with divine flowery tassels and piloted by the wish of their steersmen, instrumental and vocal music 
is resonating, and gandharva-s are singing and apsara-s are dancing in them. [3-35-19, 20]

Shlok 21: Ravana proceeded while observing thousands of woodlands with sandalwood trees that are soothing and 
satisfying the sense of smell, and that oozed sweet-smelling resin at their bases. [3-35-21]

Shlok 22: He also observed on his way the forests and woodlands containing the noteworthy aloe plants, Takkola 
trees, and the nutmeg trees that are with fruits and aromatic, as well. [3-35-22]

Shlok 23: Also seen are the flowers of Tamaala trees, shrubberies of pepper, and heaps of desiccating pearl-oysters 
along the seashore. [3-35-23]

Shlok 24: Thus, he saw the peaking boulders, like that the reefs of corals, and like that also at the mountains 
that have golden and silvern crests. [3-35-24]

Shlok 25- 26a: On seeing the delightful, serene, and marvellous cascades, and cities that are abundant in wealth and 
agricultural produce, and abundant with gemlike womenfolk, and that are replete with elephants, horses, 
and chariots, Ravana proceeded further. [3-35-25, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Ravana observed the delta adjacent to seacoast of that kingly ocean to be uniform and smooth, while 
the light air breezing in there is soft for touch, thus it looked heavenly. [3-35-26b, 27a]

[Commentary] The demons did not get their share of amR^ita 'divine elixir' therefore they cannot be 
called amR^ita ashibhiH 'ambrosia consumers.' As such, some other mms contain this 
expression amR^ita arthibhiH 'desirers of ambrosia...' the demons. They also frequent those 
coasts along with gods.

Shlok 27b- 28a: There Ravana also saw a banyan tree which in sheen is like a black-cloud, and the branches of which 
are stretching all over for a hundred yojana-s in length, and on which sages made their abode for practising 
ascesis. [3-35-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: This is the tree on the branch of which once highly mighty Divine Eagle Garuda swooped to perch, clawing 
an elephant and a mammoth tortoise, for the purpose of dining them out on that tree-branch. [3-35-28b, 
29a]

[Commentary] One yojana is 900 miles, where one yojana is nine English miles. The legendary version is that the elephant 
and tortoise are engaged in a fierce fight though none of them is a prey to the other, and seeing them 
and to teach a lesson to such causeless quarrellers, Garuda flies in and claws both and searches for 
a place to feast on them. Finding this tree worthwhile to have a leisure dinner he dashes on to one 
branch.

Shlok 29b- 30a: While descending rapidly then that best bird among birds Garuda suddenly broke that tree's branch which 
is full with leaves, owing to the impact of his high impetuosity. [3-35-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: Adhering to that tree-branch there are eminent sages like, Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s, 
Aja-s, and even sages like Dhuumraa-s that thrive on fumes and smokes are there, and there they are 
collectively practising asceticism upside down while clasping branches with their legs. [3-35-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: For the sake of the grace of those sages Garuda took flight from that tree, grasping that broken tree-branch 
of a hundred yojana length along with those pendulous sages with his beak, and both of the elephant 
and tortoise with both of his claws. [3-35-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33: That virtue-souled Garuda consumed the meat of his prays, namely the elephant and the giant tortoise 
with a single foot, and destroyed the province of tribesmen with the same broken tree branch, and thus 
that supreme bird Garuda gained an incomparable happiness in rescuing those great-sages. [3-35-32b, 
33]

[Commentary] Garuda held tortoise and elephant in two claws in the first instance and when to settle down on tree 
branch he transferred one pray from one claw to the other and held both of them by one claw and with 
the other free claw he caught hold of the tree branch. But it broke under his weight, and then suddenly 
without making it to fall on ground he grasped that branch with his beak and took to flight. While flying 
in sky he held both the preys in claw, and the tree branch into the other. Then he started to eat his 
preys in sky with one claw, still upholding the branch from falling. Seeing this feat of Garuda, the 
sages clinging to that tree branch bless him to be successful in his next mission and leave that branch. 
When that tree branch is free from sages, Garuda throws it on a province of some antagonistic tribal 
community, by weight of which the whole of that tribal community is destroyed. This is one way of telling 
the myth.

Shlok 34: When his valour has become twice as much with that happiness that heedful Garuda indeed resolved to 
bring ambrosia from heaven. [3-35-34]

Shlok 35: Smashing the guard of iron-grid completely and crashing the unbreakable diamond -like strongroom in 
which the ambrosia is safeguarded, then Garuda carried off ambrosia from the palace of Indra. [3-35-35]

Shlok 36: Ravana on his way saw such a banyan tree named as Subhadra which is a much sought after tree for assemblages 
of great sages, and which betokens the deeds of that best-winged Garuda. [3-35-36]

Shlok 37: On going to the other side of the lord of rivers, namely ocean, Ravana saw a pleasing hermitage in the 
sacred and scenic interior of the forest. [3-35-37]

Shlok 38: At that place Ravana saw the demon named Maareecha, wearing jute-clothes and black deerskin and tufts 
of hairs, and the one with regulated diet. [3-35-38]

Shlok 39: That demon Maareecha welcomed the king Ravana and customarily entertained him catering all the offerings 
that are beyond the scope of humans. [3-35-39]

Shlok 40: On personally offering meals and drinking water, and venerating him properly Maareecha spoke this sentence 
to Ravana which is connotative of significance. [3-35-40]

Shlok 41: "Oh, king of the demons, is everything well with your Lanka? Oh, king, for what reason you have put 
in an appearance again, that too in a trice? [3-35-41]

[Commentary] This statement contains 'why you have come again?' and taking hold of this word, 'again...' some, who 
hold that the episode of Akampana is justifiable, say that the episode of Akampana is not interpolated 
but the original work of Valmiki. For this, the ex-party says that when a whole of chapter is included, 
inclusion of one word 'again...' is not a bothersome affair to the mythologists or interpolators. When 
it is questioned that interspersing Akampana's episode defeats the spectacular entry of Ravana, the 
defendants say that the antagonists need not be given such priorities. So also, Vali's Kishkindha is 
not portrayed in a spectacular way when Sugreeva attacked Vali for the first time, but it is detailed 
in the second round, to some extent, and fully when Lakshmana enters it.

[Commentary] In this episode, a jump of event to Garuda's exploits may be jerky, but it is questioned when can Ravana 
recollect about Garuda's might, why does he ignore still mightier Vishnu. Ravana's continuous fear for 
Vishnu made him to think of Garuda - that too, on seeing Subhadra, the banyan tree, and that too - while 
going to kidnap Seetha.

[Commentary] The path through which Ravana coursed is towards Himalayas, where an idolatry place called deva 
bhuumi is said to be earmarked for higher souls. When Rama hit Maareecha, he fell far off from 
the ritual place of Vishwamitra. That place is said to be on northern side of Himalayas. Some 
ancient mms contain this verse which also tell about that place as deva bhuumi and it is on 
the northern side of kuru i.e., kurukhsetra where Great War of Maha Bharata 
occurred: uttarËnÃ¾ca 
kurÂ¨n paÃ¾yan paÃ¾yan caiva nagottamËn | deva dËnava sanghaiÃ ca sevitam hi amÂ®ta arthibhiÃ ||

Shlok 42: When Maareecha spoke to him thus, that highly radiant and eloquent Ravana then afterwards spoke this 
sentence to Maareecha. [3-35-42]



SARGA 36
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana seeks Maareecha's help to abduct Seetha. He asks Maareecha to assume the
shape of a golden-deer and lure Seetha, and then Seetha asks Rama and Lakshmana to fetch that
golden-deer. If Rama and Lakshmana are distracted from the hermitage, Ravana can safely abduct
Seetha. Listening to this Maareecha is struck dead, because he is already struck with the arrow of
Rama when he was in Tataka forest. As such, Maareecha tries to explain Ravana about Rama's
quintessence.

Shlok 1: "Give attention to my words as I speak, oh, sire, Maareecha, I am an anguished one,
and when I am in such an anguish you are the ultimate course to me, isn't so." Thus Ravana started
addressing Maareecha. [3-36-1]

Shlok 2- 3- 4: "You are aware as to how my brother Khara, and the mighty armed Duushana, also my
sister Shuurpanakha, and even the highly fiery demon and devourer of raw-flesh Trishira, and even
numerous other night-walking demons who are cocksure of hitting their targets have made Janasthaana
as their residency, and while residing there they put the sages of that great forest that tread a
righteous path to torture, of course, all this as assigned by me. [3-36-2, 3, 4]

Shlok 5: "You are equally aware of the stationing fourteen thousand braving demons in
Janasthaana, who are the followers of the wish of Khara, who are with fiendish exploits, and who
are the troublemakers to the sages of Dandaka forest or to the intruders therein, aren't you.
[3-36-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: "But recently those great mighty demons that are the residents of Janasthaana,
namely Khara and others, preparing themselves inordinately and wielding diverse weapons and
assaulters, for their part had an encounter with Rama in a combat. [3-36-6, 7a]

[Commentary] This episode is narrated in chapter 33, i.e., the episode of Akampana, but there
is a difference in the way of Ravana's narration at this place than the previous one. This is
another point to discuss whether Akampana's episode is an original work or an interpolation.

Shlok 7b- 8a: "With rancour tiding in him, and without making any scathing remark in the least,
that Rama brought his bow into play with arrows in the van of the combat. [3-36-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "But that foot-soldier, that too, a human, has completely wiped out those
fourteen-thousand demons with flaring fieriness with his fierce arrows. [3-36-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Khara is hewed down, Duushana is mowed down, and even Trishira is hacked down,
thereof that Dandaka forest is rendered free from the fear of demons. [3-36-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "He who is put to flight by his infuriated father, and who came to Dandaka forest
along with his wife, that ignoble Kshatriya is the slaughterer of that demonic army of mine, as his
lifespan is diminished. [3-36-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "He is out of character, brutal, firestorm, senseless, selfish, one with his senses
unconquered and righteousness discarded, and he is an unrighteous soul just delighting in the
disservice of all beings. [3-36-11b, 12a]

[Commentary] For those who hold Ravana as the devotee of Rama / Vishnu, as one of the two doorkeepers, namely 
Jaya and Vijaya, the above lines of Ravana will become irksome. For that Maheshvara Tiirtha has 
stepped in and gave a commentary that conceives Ravana as a true devotee of Rama.

[Commentary] kruddhaa pitraa nirastaH kim? 'is he necked out by his angry father?' No. To please Kaikeyi 
and the boon given to her by his father, Rama is unhoused. sa bhaarya= sabhaa aaryaH 'in 
assemblages, venerable one.' Rama is one with high esteem. kshiiNa jiivitaH kim? 'is his 
lifespan diminishing? No. He is eternal. kshatriya paamsana= kshatriyaan paati iti kshatriyaH 
paH 'because he protects Kshatriya-s he is a noble Kshatriya, and sa ca asau a.msanaH ca, 
amsana aaghaate 'enemy destroyer,' destroyer of enemies of Kshatriya-s. karkashaH 
'brutal' to enemies, not to adherents, therefore he is: amuurkhaH, alubdhaH: he s 
not senseless, not selfish. adharma aatmaa kim? No, he is not an unrighteous person. And
bhuutaanaam a hite a rataH, 'for beings, in disservice, not, delights': he does not 
delight in the disservice of all created beings.' Thus, he is Supreme Person.

[Commentary] But Rama Tilaka, on the other hand refutes this derivation stating that Ravana is not an out and out 
devotee of Rama, and these many adhyaadhaara-s 'ellipses' need not be brought in to justify 
mythological import to Ramayana. There is a section of pundits that argue Ramayana precedes 18 
puraaNaa-s the 18 mythological treatises, and they refuse to believe that Ravana is NOT a 
devotee of Rama.

[Commentary] In anyway, the innuendo incorporated in certain verses has given rise to diverse commentaries, but 
the unity of Ramayana is kept up, either by Shaivaites or Vaishnavaite or other sects of Hindu 
thinking.

Shlok 12b- 13- 14a: "By whom my sister is disfigured stripping off her nose and ears, that too, without
any enmity but just depending upon his own brawn, I would like to inveigle such a man's nymphean
wife Seetha holding sway on her in Janasthaana, and in that matter I want you to be my aide in
Dandaka forest. [3-36-12b, 13, 14a]

Shlok 14b: "Oh, highly powerful Maareecha, with you and with my brothers standing by my side as
my associates, I indeed care a damn for all of the gods if they are going to wage a war against me,
therefore, oh, demon Maareecha, as you are capable of rendering aid you should indeed become my
aide in this venture. [3-36-14b, 15]

Shlok 16: "In valour, war and verve there is none similar to you, you are a topmost stalwart
in trickery, and a matchless expert in illusive-tricks. [3-36-16]

Shlok 17: "I have come nigh of you only for that reason, oh, nightwalker, and listen to that
deed which you have to do in the course of helping me as I detail you. [3-36-17]

Shlok 18: "On becoming an astounding golden deer with silver dots, you move in front of Seetha
in the hermitage of that Rama. [3-36-18]

Shlok 19: "On seeing you in the shape of a deer, Seetha undoubtedly bids her husband
forthwith, and even Lakshmana, saying, 'lay hold of it.' [3-36-19]

Shlok 20: "Then on the diversion of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, I will comfortably and
unimpededly abduct Seetha in that lonely place, as planet Rahu abducts the shine of moon.
[3-36-20]

Shlok 21: "Thereafter Rama will be enervated by the abduction of his wife, and then surely and
conveniently I wish to retaliate him if he is going to come up against me, for my inner-soul will
be firstly gratified with its volition, namely possessing Seetha." Thus Ravana requested Maareecha.
[3-36-21]

[Commentary] Maheshvara Tiirtha expresses this in terms of Ravana's devotion to Rama. raame bhaaryaa haraNa 
karSite: raama ibha 'Rama, the elephant...' aaryaa 'a venerable one, Seetha...' 
haraNa karSite 'by abduction, harmed by...' adhyadhaara: mat shariiram elliptical: 'my 
body...' tataH 'thereby, by virtue of my act of abducting...' kR^ita arthena 
antaraatmanaa upalakshitaH san 'on my soul-cherished desire becoming fulfilled to get 
salvation...' paschaat 'thereafter...' visrabdham 'impeccably...' sukham 
= moksha, salvation, highest bliss...' prahariSyaami: prakarSeNa hariSyaami 'evidently I 
snatch off that bliss...'

[Commentary] "When I abduct that venerable Seetha, the wife of Elephant like Rama, my body gets harmed like an 
eclipsed moon, but my soul gets fulfilled as I desire eternal salvation, and I can get it evidently 
and impeccably at the hand of Rama, owing to the ill-virtue of my abduction of Seetha.

[Commentary] The eclipsing planet Rahu may hide moon temporarily by which the world looses moonshine for a while. 
If Ravana temporarily hides Seetha, as Rahu hides the moon, Rama, who metaphors with the three 
worlds, may be in gloom temporarily. But neither Rahu nor Ravana are illuminated or enlightened with 
the presence of the moonbeams of Seetha, alias Goddess Lakshmi, for they tried to seize that 
all-illuminating Moon/Seetha by force.

Shlok 22: On listening the very word of Rama that honest-souled Maareecha's mouth is
completely dried up, and he is fully frightened. [3-36-22]

Shlok 23: Wetting dried up lips with his tongue he has become goggle-eyed almost like an
about-to-die animal, and he agonisingly looked up at Ravana with winkless eyes. [3-36-23]

[Commentary] At the very word 'Rama' Maareecha is shuddered.
dashaanana samudiirita vacanam aakarNya raama shabda shravaNa maatreNa sa.mtrasta hR^idayo maariicaH kR^itaanjaliH evam uvaaca - dk From the time when he was firstly struck by Rama's arrow he retired to hermitage 
and no demonic activity is undertaken by Maareecha. But now Ravana is instigating, which leads 
Maareecha to his own end, of which he is perfectly aware.

Shlok 24: Maareecha's heart sank with scare as he is aware of Rama's valour when he was in the
great forest of Tataka, thus suppliantly making palm-fold he started telling about factuality of
Rama to Ravana, which is beneficial both to Ravana and to himself, as well, if only Ravana is
heedful of it. [3-36-24]



SARGA 37
------------------------------

[Text] Maareecha advises Ravana to stay away from Rama with his own unpleasant experience
with Rama's arrow when he was in Tataka forest, and portrays a gruesome picture of Rama to Ravana,
asking him to not to meddle with Rama's affairs.

Shlok 1: On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, Maareecha, a
well-informed one and an articulator spoke to the lord of demons in reply. [3-37-1]

Shlok 2: "It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is
impossible to get them who talk judgementally and give suggestions that may be apparently insipid,
but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises. [3-37-2]

[Commentary] There are many who render advises without weighing pros and cons, but just to
get along and please their master. There will be none to suggest expeditiously, though that
suggestion presently will be unpleasant and unsavoury like a recuperative insipid diet, but in
reality, it is result-oriented. Even if such an advisor suggests in earnest, he will have no
listener who listens earnestly and effectuates it. So, listen to my words that may now be
unsavoury, but will prove beneficial to you in long run, if you can foresee your future properly.
Dharmaakuutam says: anena sva prayojana virodha sankayaa raaja buddhi anusaareNa vaktaaro 
mantriNaH sulabhaaH - kintu anartha paryavasaayino raajabuddhim tiraskritya shubhodarka vaktaaro 
mantriNo durlabhaa iti suucitam - then the commentator goes on to quote vidura niiti from Maha Bharata, wherein it
is said: yo hi dharma samaashritya hatvaa bhatruH priyaarthe | apriyaaNi aaha pathyaani tena 
raajaa sahaayavaan || sulabhaaH puruSaa raajan satatam priya vaadinaH | apriyasya ca pathyasya 
vaktaa shrotaa ca durlabhaH ||  The last two foots may be observed because they are similar to the above
verse of Ramayana, by such similarities some hold the opinion that Maha Bharata is an explanation
to Ramayana.

Shlok 3: "Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept,
for you are impetuous and desultory in dealing with your spies, but that Rama is identical to the
thunderous Mahendra and tempestuous Varuna, the Rain-god. [3-37-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Rama
will render this world de-demonised! [3-37-4]

[Commentary] '...but for you...' 'Will you let the demons on earth live, or, would like to
eradicate them through Rama, through your obsessions.' The second thought has come true when Rama
eliminated all demons.

Shlok 5: "Has this Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, taken birth to end your life, or what! And
because of this Seetha will there be a great disaster, so to speak! [3-37-5]

Shlok 6: "Egocentric and rampant, such as you are, on acquiring you as her lord, will the
City of Lanka be doomed along with her demons, and you put together, or what! [3-37-6]

Shlok 7: "Any king of your like who is with a self-will, ill-will, ensorcelled by evil, and
malicious in intent, that king alone ruins his own city-state, his own people, even himself, as a
matter of actual fact. [3-37-7]

[Commentary] For this the commentator says: anena dur mantritaH kaamavritto naya dveSii 
raajaa sakala mantri vargeNa aishvaryenA saha nashyati iti uktam - tathaa ca kaamandake - anaatmavaan naya 
dveSii vardhaya ari sampadaH | praapyaa api mahad aishvaryam saha tena vinashyati ||  Dharmaakuutam being an encyclopedic commentary on
Ramayana quotes Kamandaka etc., in such matters of dharma. The availability of the books quoted by
the commentator of Dharmaakuutam in reprint is doubtful, where Dharmaakuutam itself is unavailable
in full, in these days.

Shlok 8: "Rama the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's happiness is completely forsaken by his
father - no, he is not; there is unseemliness in him - no, not in the least; he is out of character
- no; he is selfish - no; he is an ignoble Kshatriya - no, not at all; and he is neither a debased
one insofar as the merits of righteousness are concerned, nor he is atrocious towards living
beings, for he takes delight in the welfare of all beings. [3-37-8, 9]

Shlok 10: "On seeing his father who is a proponent of truth, and whom Kaikeyi has outwitted,
that virtue-souled Rama neatly decamped from Ayodhya saying that 'I will prove my father to be a
real proponent of truth.' [3-37-10]

Shlok 11: "Discarding the kingdom and even royal-comforts Rama entered Dandaka forest only to
fulfil the cherish of Kaikeyi, viz., kingdom for her son Bharata, and even that of Dasharatha,
viz., to remain loyal to his promise to Kaikeyi. [3-37-11]

Shlok 12: "Rama is ruthless - no; an unscholarly one - no; unconquered are his senses - no;
and oh, boy, it is unapt of you to speak of impalpable and unheard-of topics in this way.
[3-37-12]

Shlok 13: "Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, he is an equable person with truthfulness
as his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the king of entire world. [3-37-13]

[Commentary] Rama's principles alone make him victorious, as he does not deviate from the
path of righteousness. And by not deviating from the path of righteousness, he is truly valorous
and the question of his defeat does not arise, because he will abide by his conscience.

Shlok 14: "Rama's proper resplendence is protecting Vaidehi. How then you really wish to
forcibly rob her off from Rama, as though wishing to rob the Sun of his resplendence. [3-37-14]

[Commentary] Incidentally, Prabha is the name of sun's brilliance and she is the wife of Sun,
and if she is to be separated from sun, only an eternal gloom overcasts the world. Ravana has no
doubt controlled natural forces like sun, moon, rivers etc., but not altogether eradicated or
upturned their functions. Then, is it possible to Ravana and hosts of his demonic-adherents to
thrive in an unnatural gloom? This is the doubt of Maareecha.

Shlok 15: "Arrows as it jets of fire, bow and sword as it firewood that fire called Rama will
be blazing in war, and it will be inapt of you to enter into such an uninfringeable fire,
recklessly. [3-37-15]

Shlok 16: "With the bow stretched to his ear becoming a gaping mouth spouting flames, arrows
becoming tongues of fire spewed forth from that flaming mouth, he that Rama the reified Terminator
will become fierce and insufferable when he wields bow and arrows, and oh, dear boy Ravana, it will
be inapt of you to at once draw pretty nigh of such an annihilator of the armies of enemies, on
discarding your kingdom, comforts and even the dear life of yours. [3-37-16, 17]

Shlok 18: "Which Rama's wife is Janaka's daughter that Rama is indeed with an inestimable
resplendence, and it will be incapable of you to steal Seetha while such a Rama's bow safeguards
her in the forest, besides the firewall called his resplendence. [3-37-18]

[Commentary] This can be said 'Rama's resplendence is inestimable and Seetha is his wife.' But 
keeping the import of Seetha's words as at 3-9-15 'if fuel is available in adjacency of burning 
fire, the luminosity of the fire also enhances immensely,' and when the factor of resplendence is 
taken, it is not Rama's resplendence alone that is described, but Seetha's also. Again, it is not 
that some part of Rama's resplendence is taken out and put in Seetha. It is an indivisible radiance 
of that couple like that of Sun and his wife Prabha, as said earlier by Maareecha. Seetha is not 
directly said by her name but her father Janaka's name is brought in, because Janaka is both a 
raajarSi and brahmarSi Kingly-saint and Brahman-sage, as well. And Janaka is capable 
of saying idam brahmam idam kshaatram shaapat api sharaat api 'here is Brahma-hood and here 
is Kshatriya-hood, either by malediction or by arrow, whichever meetly of you, you can confront me.' 
This apart, it is said that 'a pertinent devotion to a god makes the devotee like that god alone.'
shraddhayaa devo devatvam ashnute and Seetha is the devotee of Rama and she became one with 
Rama. Thereby, there is twofold resplendence, namely, that of Rama and that of Seetha, so it is 
inapt of you to make any useless effort when everything is firewalled.

Shlok 19: "That lady Seetha is his wife, dearest than the lives of that lion-chested lion-man
Rama, and in truth, she is avowed to follow him alone, in perpetuity. [3-37-19]

Shlok 20: "As the spire of blazing ritual fire cannot be abused, so also, she that curvaceous
Maithili, the cherished wife of that dynamic Rama, is an impossibility for any abuse. [3-37-20]

Shlok 21: "Oh, king of demons, What is the result in making such a futile effort? If that Rama
glances at you in a given war that alone ends your life. [3-37-21]

[Commentary] The very start for any negative activity itself is self-ruinous to the starter.
anena sarva anarthaka kaaraNa bhuuto balavat virodho na kaarya iti suucitam - tathaa ca 
praaciinaaH - - anucita karma aarambhaH sva jana virodho baliiyasaa spardhaa | pramadaa jane 
vishvaaso mrityu dvaaraaNi catvaari || dk  'undesirable activity, starting that
activity, too much of enmity with one's own people, too much belief in one's own womenfolk... are
the four doors to death...' Hence, Maareecha is advising Ravana not to embark on a wrong foot, and
even if Seetha is forcibly abducted, she cannot be possessed because she surrounded by a firewall,
namely the resplendence of that couple.

Shlok 22: "If you cherish to take pleasure for a long time in your life, in your comforts and
also thus in your kingdom, which kingdom is highly impossible to achieve, do not do anything
unpleasant to Rama. [3-37-22]

Shlok 23: "Such as you are, you should firstly deliberate with all of your ministers that have
a righteous bearing, duly keeping your brother Vibheeshana at the helm of affairs, and then you
take a decision on your own considering rights and wrongs of the case, and bearing in mind about
your own strengths and weakness, and even on making sure of Raghava's capability in its reality,
and then it will be apt of you to take up befitting action that will be conducive to your
interests. [3-37-24,25]

Shlok 25: "Oh, king of nightwalkers Ravana, I for myself deem that your confrontation with
Rama, the prince of Kosala, in a war is improper, and a better, befitting, and a reasonable one is
this advise of mine, to which you may listen further. [3-37-25]



SARGA 38
------------------------------

[Text] Maareecha continues his good word to Ravana and he dissuades him from abducting
Seetha. His advice is that the dalliance with other's wives is the greatest sin, more so, with
Rama's wife as Rama's valour is irrefutable. Maareecha narrates how Rama hurt him while
safeguarding Vishwamitra's Vedic-ritual, when Rama was still a young boy.

Shlok 1: "At one time even I was on the rove around this earth, taking pride in my valour,
bearing the strength of a thousand elephants, mountainous in my size and black-cloudlike in my
sheen, wearing ear-knobs and a crown made out of refined gold, with a bludgeon as my weapon, and
such as I was, I rambled Dandaka forest causing terror to the world, and eating the fleshes of
sages." Thus Maareecha started to narrate his experience with Rama. [3-38-1, 2]

Shlok 3b- 4a: "The virtue-souled great-saint Vishvamitra who was highly scared of me, then on
going to Dasharatha in person that great-saint spoke this to that lord of people. [3-38-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: " 'An awesome dismay has befallen owing to this Maareecha, oh, lord of people
Dasharatha, let Rama safeguard me becoming alert at the opportune time of the Vedic-ritual.
[3-38-4b 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: "When he is spoken in that way, then that virtue-souled king Dasharatha replied that
great-fortunate and great-saint Vishvamitra in this way. [3-38-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: " 'This boy Rama is less than twelve years in his age, unproficient in the use of
weapons, and if need be, whatever army of mine is there it will march on along with me instead of
Rama. [3-38-6b, 7a]

[Commentary] In Bala Kanda the age of Rama as said by Dasharatha to Vishvamitra is uuna
SoDasa varSaH 'less than sixteen years.' Here Maareecha is saying that Rama is less than twelve.
Maheshvara Tiirtha says that Maareecha lessened the age of Rama only to intimidate Ravana.

Shlok 7b- 8a: " 'And having come in person with fourfold forces, oh eminent sage, I myself will
eradicate that nightwalker whomever you indicate as an enemy of yours." So said Dasharatga to
Vishvamitra. [3-38-7b, 8a]

[Commentary] In the fourfold army the four categories of army units are chariots, elephants,
cavalry, and foot-soldiers.

Shlok 8b- 9a: "When the sage Vishvamitra is spoken thus, then he said to the king, 'No other force
in the world than Rama can counterbalance that demon. [3-38-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: " 'No doubt, you are a defender of gods in wars, and oh, king, the exploits you have
undertaken on behalf of gods are well-known in the triad of worlds. [3-38-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: " 'Maybe your army is a remarkable one, oh, enemy-inflamer, let it sit tight here
alone, and even if this great resplendent one is still a boy he alone is competent to forestall
that Maareecha, hence oh, enemy-subjugator, let good betide you, I wish to take him alone along
with me.' [3-38-10b, 11]

Shlok 12: "Thus that way on saying he that sage Vishvamitra returned to his own hermitage
highly gladdening to take the prince Rama along with him. [3-38-12]

Shlok 13: "Then in Dandaka forest Rama twingeing his amazing bow stayed nearby the sage
Vishvamitra who entered the vow of Vedic-ritual. [3-38-13]

[Commentary] There is a difference in mentioning the forest as Dandaka. Bala Kanda says that
Vishvamitra performed ritual in north and Maareecha is now saying that as Dandaka forest.

Shlok 14: "At that time, yet unborn are the identities of adulthood like moustache on his
face, and that providential one was magnificent in looks with a peacock-blue complexion, wearing a
single cloth, locks of hair, and golden locket, and wielding a bow, and he was irradiating the
Dandaka forest with a radiating radiance of his own, and then he appeared like the just risen
baby-moon. [3-38-14, 15]

[Commentary] The identities of adulthood are the discardable things like moustaches, beard,
etc. These are natural to humans or to birthed beings. But the mythological entities do not have
them. As a young scholar, the boys are supposed to wear simply, hence 'one-piece-clothing' is said
to be the dress of Rama. This suggests that he is not wearing any shield or armour to keep him
safe. In Bala Kanda, at the outset of the journey of Rama and Lakshmana with Vishvamitra, it is
said that they are wearing finger-covers made of certain lizard skin, which means to say that their
fingers are very tender in using arrows. His mothers delicately arranged the locks of hair, because
he is still 'boyish' to her. More so, he is with a 'boyish' ornament, say a single pendant, not
verily embellished with princely jewellery. He appeared like some providential 'boy' hitherto
unseen, with the height of a peacock, with the complexion of peacock-neck-blue, and moving about
like a noble peacock. This boyish-Rama peacock is not screaming, yet his bow is twanging; leave
alone the screeching and screaming.

[Commentary] The 'new-moon' metaphor to Rama suggests that he has only waxing and no waning
in him, uttarottara abhivR^iddhi and also that he is by birth an antagonist of tamas 'the
darkness,' or darkish activities, like the moon whose activity is only to illumine the night.
Further, he has a likeable persona to any, even to the present demon Maareecha, and even to Ravana.
When Ravana sees Rama for the first time in war, Ravana praisefully acknowledges Rama's
personality. Besides, Rama's gleam is like that of a baby-moon, against the backdrop of a thickish,
darkish, blackish sky, called the forest.

Shlok 16: "And I who was like a massive black-cloud, wearing golden ear-knobs, already a
forceful one further reinforced with the boon of Brahma, I pridefully entered into the interior of
Vishwamitra's hermitage. [3-38-16]

[Commentary] The golden ear-knobs on the lobes of ears are either indicative of the knowledge
one possess or the wealth factor. Maareecha refers to these ear ornaments more than once suggesting
that 'wealth or wisdom is nothing to Rama, but righteousness alone will work out.' Because Ravana
did not give an ear for the suggestions of Maareecha, his Lanka, built with refined gold, will be
burnt to ashes in Sundara Kanda.

Shlok 17: "Rama quickly noticed me on my very entry with an uplifted weapon, and on seeing me
he unexcitedly strung bowstring to his bow. [3-38-17]

Shlok 18: "Unmindfully trivialising him as, 'this Raghava is just a boy,' I made haste and ran
towards that Fire-altar of Vishvamitra. [3-38-18]

Shlok 19: "He then released an acute arrow that eliminates the enemy, and hit by it I am
plunged into the ocean which was a hundred yojana-s off. [3-38-19]

Shlok 20: "That Rama did not wish to kill me then, and I am thus saved by that valiant one,
oh, dear boy Ravana, but the thrust of Rama's arrow bewildered my animation and I was on my last
legs. [3-38-20]

Shlok 21: "That way I who had been flung into the abyssal water of the ocean by him gained
consciousness after a long time and proceeded towards the city of Lanka. [3-38-21]

Shlok 22: "At that time, that one with elementary knowledge in the use of weaponry, but who
can undertake deeds in an effortless manner, such a boy, such a Rama spared me, albeit killing them
that were my helpmates in that escapade. [3-38-22]

Shlok 23: "Thereby, if you wish to make for any confrontation with Rama, despite of my
proscribing you, you will ruin yourself on getting a disastrous calamity. [3-38-23]

Shlok 24: "The demons are methodical in sporting and flirting, thus by their own conduct they
are also socialising and frolicking, and to them you derive distress and disaster. [3-38-24]

Shlok 25: "Dense with skyscrapers and palaces, and decorated with many a gemstone is that city
Lanka, but you will see it completely shattered down, for the sake of that Maithili. [3-38-25]

Shlok 26: "Even if with uncommitted sins, the sinless will get ruined owing to their
interdependence with other sinners, like the fish in a lake with snakes. [3-38-26]

Shlok 27: "Bedaubed with divine sandal-paste, beautified with divine ornaments are the limbs
of the demons now, perchance you will be seeing them trampled out on ground for the blunder of
yours. [3-38-27]

Shlok 28: "Maybe, you will have to see the fleeing of the nightwalkers surviving after the
carnage in all ten directions, some abandoning their wives and some along with their wives, only
for lack of a protector. [3-38-28]

Shlok 29: "Without a doubt you will be seeing Lanka encircled with an enmesh of arrows,
enfolded in the tongues of torches, while her buildings are utterly gutting down. [3-38-29]

Shlok 30: "Oh, king, there is no other sin that is outrageous and gravest than the dalliance
with another's wife and, besides, you already have a thousand wives, isn't so! [3-38-30]

Shlok 31: "Abide by your own wife and be delighted with her, oh, demon, safeguard your own
ethnos, thus safeguard dignity, affluence, and kingdom of demons, thereby safeguard even your own
dear life. [3-38-31]

Shlok 32: "If you desire to take pleasure with your beautiful wives and with your friend's
circles for a long time, do not do anything undesirable to Rama. [3-38-32]

Shlok 33: "If you wish to intimidate Seetha aggressively despite of my considerable preventing
in all my good-heartedness towards you, then your army will fade away, and you with your kinsfolk
will emigrate to the world of Yama, the Terminator, for your life will be taken away by the arrow
of Rama." Thus, Maareecha spoke to Ravana. [3-38-33]



SARGA 39
------------------------------

[Text] Maareecha further advises Ravana to avoid confrontation with Rama for it would be
ruinous to the entire demonic race. He narrates another episode of his misadventure with Rama and
how he escaped from the all-pursuant arrow of Rama.

Shlok 1: "Thus I was somehow released by him in a confrontation then in his teens. Now you
may also listen to what has happened later in his adulthood." Thus Maareecha continued his advise
to Ravana. [4-39-1]

Shlok 2: "Though Rama hit me previously in such a way, I unabashedly entered Dandaka forest
together with two more demons who were in the guise of animals. [4-39-2]

Shlok 3: "On becoming a gigantic carnivorous animal with a torching tongue, incisive teeth
and excruciating horns, and with an extraordinary energy, I was on the rove in Dandaka forest while
getting at Rama. [4-39-3]

Shlok 4: "I moved about Dandaka forest, oh, Ravana, in an extremely horrible aspect of
animal, utterly brutalising the sages at ritual-altars, holy bathing places and under the trees of
religious sanctuaries while reaching Rama. [4-39-4]

Shlok 5: "I have proceeded to Rama killing saints in Dandaka forest who are the treaders in
saintliness, and drinking off their blood and feasting on their flesh. [4-39-5]

Shlok 6: "On becoming such a brutal animal I have been eating the flesh of sages, frightening
the forest dwellers, and in that way I rambled in Dandaka forest besotted with blood-drinking while
reaching Rama. [4-39-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "While I was wandering in Dandaka forest as an abuser of virtue, then I reached Rama
who by then has assumed the rectitude befitting to a saint, and I even reached the great-fortunate
Vaidehi and top-speeded-chariot-rider Lakshmana. [4-39-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9- 10: "I was in the shape of an animal with incisive horns. Such as I was I recollected my
earlier grudge against that great mighty Rama who takes delight in the welfare of all being, who by
then was santlike on a regulated diet and abiding in the forest, whereby I presumed him to be mere
hermit. In that way, I was very extremely infuriated to recollect his earlier assault on me, and I
indiscriminately dashed towards him, only to kill him, completely disregarding his other faculties.
[4-39-8b, 9, 10]

Shlok 11: "Stringing out his highly magnificent bow Rama then released three excruciating and
enemy eliminating arrows which in their egress match the Air-god and the Divine-Eagle Garuda.
[4-39-11]

Shlok 12: "All those three thunderbolt like arrows that have only blood for their board,
acutely bent at barbs, and that are highly horrendous have come at us in a coordinated manner.
[4-39-12]

Shlok 13: "As I have earlier seen the fear caused by his arrow I am in the know of Rama's
valour, hence I retreated from there trickily and gingerly, but the other two demons were killed.
[4-39-13]

[Commentary] Here the action of Rama's arrow is indicated. Rama's arrow will not shoot at the
back of the opponent or it backstabs either. Even when killing Vali, though Rama is not affronting
Vali, Rama's arrow pierced Vali's chest. Here because Maareecha is retreating, that third arrow of
Rama did not kill Maareecha but followed him in a chasing manner. But the other two demons
unknowing about Rama's arrow, they confronted him and the other two arrows eliminated them. There
is discussion on the word shaThaH 'one capable to trick' used in the verse as some mms employ the
word sharaH, 'an arrow.' In this section vividly explainable verses are there in some ancient
versions of mms. This particular verse reads like this in them: paraakramaj~no raamasya tathaa dR^iSTa bhayaH puraa | aapatantam sharam 

dR^iSTvaa megha ga.mbhiira nissvanam || tato aham vegavaan tatra vaata.mhaa 

nimeshataH | apa kraanta param paaram nivR^ittaH saagaraat sharaH ||  'I am in the know of Rama's valour, and I am also in the know of what fear
he caused in an earlier instance, and on seeing the arrows coming upon like thunderous clouds, in a
wink I escaped to the other side of ocean, and Rama's arrow having come chasing me up to
ocean-shore returned.' In here, the efficacy of Rama's arrow is clearly narrated and it is not
clear why pundits did not consider these verses of ancient mms instead of the above verse.

Shlok 14: "When I was somehow exempted by the arrow of Rama I regained lifespan, and when that
arrow made me to renounce everything like a monk and fled me to this place, the other side of ocean
to where you came by your aircraft, here I am living here in a yogic way, self-collectedly like an
ascetic. [4-39-14]

Shlok 15: "From then on wards, I am indeed descrying Rama at this tree and at that tree,
dressed in jute-cloths and black deerskin, and handling his bow like the Terminator handling a
tether. [4-39-15]

Shlok 16: "Given to fright I even visualise thousands Rama-s, and whole this forest is
reflecting to me as one entity of Rama. [4-39-16]

Shlok 17: "Even at a place void of people I am envisaging Rama alone, and oh, king of demons,
even if he enters my dream, in fact, I am jolting up and swooning. [4-39-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, Ravana, appalled of Rama the names starting with the syllable 'ra' like
ratna-s, ratha-s, viz., gemstones, chariots are appalling to me, including your name, that starts
with a 'ra....' [4-39-18]

[Commentary] 'If I hear the first letter 'ra' of any given name, I am scared at the ensuing
second syllable presuming it to be 'ma' and if that second syllable of that word I am going to hear
happens to be other than 'ma' then my fear ceases.'

Shlok 19: "I am well-acquainted with his efficacy, and a war with him will be an unfair thing
for you, for that Raghu's descendant can in fact kill either Emperor Bali or Namuchi, the demon.
[4-39-19]

[Commentary] Emperor Bali is more powerful and mighty than Ravana. aananda raamaayana says in
a chapter on the 'defeats of Ravana' raavaNa paraajaya, that Ravana once entered netherworld to
conquer it, where Bali is held captive by Trivikrama, i.e., Vishnu. At that time Bali and his queen
are playing dice game. When Ravana entered, the dice in the hand of Bali has slipped to the floor,
and Bali asks Ravana to pick and give it before conquering netherworld. Ravana who lifted Mt.
Kailash could not lift that two-inch dice, which is so far handled playfully by Bali. Such is the
might of Emperor Bali

Shlok 20: "You may either wage a war with Rama if you wish to avenge the killings of Khara and
others, or forgive and forget that Rama agreeing to my suggestions, but do not broach the topic of
Rama with me if you wish to see me alive. [4-39-20]

Shlok 21: "In the world many of the sagacious and reasonable people that are the practisers of
righteousness are utterly ruined along with their kith and kin, just by the misdeeds of others.
[4-39-21]

Shlok 22: "Such a saintly one as I am, I am bound to ruin by other's misdeeds, hence you do
whatever that is fair to you, but I am not the one to simply take after you. [4-39-22]

Shlok 23: "Definitely Rama is the one with exceptional resplendence, exemplary courage and
extraordinary power, and for sure, he becomes an eradicator of the world of demons. [4-39-23]

Shlok 24: "If Khara positioned in Janasthaana has firstly overstepped his bounds and attacked
Rama, that too owing to Shuurpanakha, and if Rama of uncomplicated actions has eliminated Khara in
self-defence, what really is the transgression of Rama in that matter, you tell of that in the
final analysis. [4-39-24]

Shlok 25: "I am saying this word of advise as I am ambitious of the wellbeing of my kinsmen
through you, and if this is disagreeable to you, you will have to deliver up your life in a
confrontation with Rama along with the lives of your kinsmen, perishing at the linearly
accelerating arrows of Rama. [4-39-25]



SARGA 40
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana rebuts Maareecha for giving an unasked advice and details his plan to abduct
Seetha. Ravana intimidates Maareecha that he himself will kill Maareecha immediately if his orders
are disobeyed, and Maareecha may perhaps have no opportunity to die at the hands of Rama.

Shlok 1: When Maareecha spoke those acceptable and equitable words, Ravana rejected them like
a person with a death wish rejects medicament. [3-40-1]

Shlok 2: Ushered by the Terminator the king of demons Ravana, uncouthly spoke these
unbefitting words to Maareecha who had been speaking conducive and beneficial words of advise.
[3-40-2]

Shlok 3: "All these meaningless words that are being said to me are decidedly worthless, in
effect, like the seeds seeded in wastelands. [3-40-3]

Shlok 4: "But it is impossible to scare me away from a war with that iniquitous and imprudent
Rama, that too, from a human being, with these words of yours. [3-40-4]

[Commentary] There is a grammarian's irk in bhettum ' to cut off, to destroy' 
bhetum 'to scare me' and if bhettum is taken, then 'it is impossible for that human to 
destroy me in war' will be the meaning, as per Eastern recension.

Shlok 5: "He who bolted off to forest in a single-foot on hearing the artless words of a
woman, forfeiting his kingdom, friends and relatives, and even his mother, likewise his father too,
you cannot scare me away from such a Rama. [3-40-5]

Shlok 6: "But his wife Seetha who is dearer to him more than his lives is certainly seizable
by me in association with you, as that Rama had purposelessly killed Khara in a war. [3-40-6]

Shlok 7: "In this way my thinking is decided and it is lingering on in my heart, and it is
impossible to roll back my mind or heart even for Indra coming along with gods and demons.
[3-40-7]

Shlok 8: "If you are asked about the credits or discredits, or either of the danger or
ideation of the deed for determining its modus operandi, it will be apt of you to talk like this,
but I did not seek any viewpoints of yours. [3-40-8]

Shlok 9: "Even if someone is asked, and if he desires his own welfare, then he has to submit
his opinion to the king suppliantly upraising his palm-fold, may he be an intellectual, or an
astute adviser. [3-40-9]

[Commentary] A king cannot be addressed unless he asks. Then Maareecha, who is fully aware of
monarchical protocol, how he informed his analysis of Rama to Ravana, will be the question. Even if
a king is resolute in undertaking a mad act, he is to be cautioned. In some cases, a king is to be
held by hair and taught, as a teacher holds the taught by his tuft of hair to earbash. Likewise an
upright minister shall counsel the king properly, as Krishna advises Vidura in Maha Bharata at
Udyoga Parva 93:

[Commentary] nanu evam sati
niitij~no maariico raavaNena apR^iShTaH katham uktavaan it cet - tanna - unmatto raaj~naa prashna
akareNa api kaaryaatyaprasaktau nigR^ihya api vaktavyatvaat - tathaa ca pR^iShTen naiva vaktavyam

viShayatvaat - aapadi uttham pratipanne c raajani kesha grahaNa puurvakam pR^iShTe naa api
vaktavyam eva - dk .

Shlok 10: "The king being lord of the land is to be addressed preceded with gentility, with
auspicious and beneficial words that do not contradict the interests of that lord, more so, they
shall be inclusive of etiquette. [3-40-10]

[Commentary] The imperial protocol is an exaggerated affair, as known to everybody. Here
Ravana is demanding one more aspect in demanding, 'the words that do not go against the whims and
fancies of the king.' And this is more than an autocrat's mentality. Dharmaakuutam says referring
to Kaamandaka, a scripture on political science: 'even if a king asks, one shall not 'readily'
reply though every aspect of that question is known to the replier, and the subject speaking in the
audience of a king shall forget his own know-all-ness or his own entity in the knowledge of the
subject at issue. vijaanan na api
bruuyaat bhartruH kShiptaH uttaram vacaH | praviiNo api hi medhaavii varjayet abhimaanitaam
||.

Shlok 11: "Or else, oh, Maareecha, even if a beneficial word is said, but if it is said with
reprehension it will not gladden that king who insists upon honour, for that said word is
dishonourable, let alone reprehension. [3-40-11]

Shlok 12: "The kings with infinite vigour embody five constituents forces of Fire, Moon, Rain,
Terminator, and that of Indra, the Administrator of Natural Forces. [3-40-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: "Oh, nightwalker, thus the kings being great-souls personify the sultriness of Fire,
sternness of Indra, softness of Moon, suppleness of Rain, and harshness of Terminator, and
therefore in all situations they are respectable and reverential. [3-40-13, 14a]

[Commentary] Ravana has already conquered Indra and the said gods are responsible for the
routine administration of universe. Hence, he is informing Maareecha about ordinary kings,
presuming that Maareecha does not recognize the rectitude in dealing with ordinary kings, more so,
with the king of kings, namely Ravana himself, which he says in next verse. A king acquires these
traits of the presiding deities of the compass, by virtue of his kingship, and the sages said the
very same to Rama when he entered Dandaka forest. anena agni aadi dik
paalaka ruupatvaat raajaa puujyo maanyaH ca iti suucitam - dk .

Shlok 14b- 15a: "But you are ill-advisedly babbling with me in this way, incognizant of rectitude
and holding on to your obsession, and wishing ill of me, as I am on your doorstep. [3-40-14b,
15a]

Shlok 15: "Oh, demon, I did not ask the rights and wrongs concerning me, nor that which is
expedient for me, but oh, demon of untold bravery, I have said this much to you. [3-40-15]

Shlok 16: " 'It will be apt of you to proffer a helping hand in this deed.' This much I said
to you. And such as you are you may now listen to that task which you have to undertake during the
course of your assistance as I detail it to you. [3-40-16]

Shlok 17: "On becoming an amazing silver-potted golden deer you move in front of Seetha in the
hermitage of Rama, and on verily alluring Vaidehi you can go away as you like. [3-40-17, 18 ]

Shlok 19: "On seeing you as a wholly illusory golden deer curiosity arises in Vaidehi, and
indeed she tells Rama, 'bring that one quickly.' [3-40-19]

Shlok 20: "Further, on Rama's coming out of his hermitage you go distantly and blurt out in
this way, 'ha Seetha' and even as, 'ha, Lakshmana,' mimicking Rama's voice. [3-40-20]

Shlok 21: "On hearing that, and further hastened by Seetha, even Soumitri apprehensively
follows the path of Rama in all his fondness for Rama. [3-40-21]

Shlok 22: "When Rama is diverted from hermitage, Lakshmana as well, I will carry off Vaidehi
effortlessly like the Thousand-eyed Indra who once carried off Sachi Devi. [3-40-22]

Shlok 23: "Oh, demon, on carrying out this stint in this manner you may go as you like, and to
you oh, Maareecha with solemn vows, I will grant half of my kingdom. [3-40-23]

Shlok 24: "Hence, oh, gentle one, get going on a trouble-free path for the easy achievement of
the task, and I for myself will follow you to Dandaka forest along with the chariot. [3-40-24]

Shlok 25: "My goal will be achieved just by misleading Raghava, and by gaining Seetha without
a conflict, then I will proceed to Lanka along with you. [3-40-25]

Shlok 26: "If you are not going to do so, oh, Maareecha, for sure I will kill you now itself.
I will get my work done through you even under duress, and indeed, any subject setting against his
king will never succeed safely. [3-40-26]

Shlok 27: "Your life may be indefinite on reaching Rama, but your death is surely definite now
as you are conflicting with me. Hence, keeping all this in view you come to a conclusion that would
be conducive to your interests, and whatever desirable to you let it be done in that way. " Thus
Ravana spoke to Maareecha. [3-40-27]



SARGA 41
------------------------------

[Text] Maareecha dissuades Ravana again and warns him of the fatal consequences if Rama is
irked by the wrongdoings of Ravana. In every utterance, Maareecha repeats that not only Ravana but
the entire demonic race is also going to ruin due to Ravana's impertinence. Finally when Ravana is
heedless of these advises, Maareecha prepares himself to die by the arrow of an enemy, namely Rama,
rather than by his own clansman, Ravana.

Shlok 1: When Ravana perversely ordered that way in all his kingliness, Maareecha spoke these
words caustically and frankly to that king of demons. [3-41-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, night-walker, by which evildoer this thought, which is self-ruinous to you,
along with your progeny, kingdom and ministers put together, is taught to you? [3-41-2]

Shlok 3: "Who is that reprobate unhappy with such a happy one like you, and oh, king, by whom
this door of demise is ingeniously shown to you? [3-41-3]

Shlok 4: "It is very clear, oh, night-walker, that your rivals with skimpy might are aspiring
that you should be completely ruined coming into conflict with more mighty Rama. [3-41-4]

Shlok 5: "He who wishes you to get ruined by your undertaking a self-made destruction is a
scoundrel with a pernicious intent, as such, by whom you are counselled to do this? [3-41-5]

Shlok 6: "Your ministers are not curbing you anywise when you scramble on a high road to
self-ruination, hence they are indeed to be sentenced to death, but they are not being executed for
their dereliction. [3-41-6]

Shlok 7: "Veracious ministers have to restrain a self-willed king when he relies on a
wrong-route, isn't it. But you are unrestrained by your ministers though you are self-willed and
though you are taking a wrong-route. [3-41-7]

Shlok 8: "Oh, best conqueror Ravana, probity, prosperity and pleasures, and even the
popularity of the ministers, oh, night-walker, are achieved at the beneficence of their master.
[3-41-8]

[Commentary] The popularity, fame etc., of someone is said as yashas and there is 
another word taken as a synonym kiirti. For this Rama Tilaka says: yashaH sva desha 
khyaati, kiirti deshaantara khyaati. Thus 'yashas is the fame within one's own country 
and kiirti is cross-country fame. For this, another ancient commentator Kulluka Bhatt says:
jiivataH khyaati ruupam yashaH, mR^itasya khyaati ruupaam kiirtim 'a living person's fame 
is yashaH and a dead person fame is kiirti Because Ravana is alive and Maareecha 
wishes him to be living, he used that chosen word.

Shlok 9: "Contrariwise, oh, Ravana, all that beneficence of the king to ministers becomes
futile when the king behaves perversely, and even the others, namely the subjects of kingdom, will
derive distress by the negative virtue of their master. [3-41-9]

Shlok 10: "The king alone is the root cause for probity and prosperity, isn't it. Therefore,
oh, best prosperous one, in all situations the kings are to be safeguarded from the ill effects of
influences. [3-41-10]

Shlok 11: "It is impossible to govern kingdom, oh, demon, the night-walker, for a king with
acridity, with hostility, or with immorality. [3-41-11]

Shlok 12: "The ministers with drastic notions will indeed fall apart together with their king,
like a chariot that gets ramshackled together with it charioteer on a rough road, though it is
hieing with galloping horses but badly controlled by that slothful charioteer. [3-41-12]

[Commentary] The ministers with drastic notions not only pull down the king and kingdom, they themselves get ruined 
along with the king and kingdom. anena tiikShNa mantribhii raao naasho bhavati iti | ataH samiiciina 
mantrii sampadaniiya iti uktam - dk -

[Commentary] tathaa ca puraaNa saare - panDiteShu guNaaH sarve muurkhe doShaa 
bhavanti hi | tasmaat muurkha sahasreShu praaam ekam niyojayet || thus puraaNa saara, a treatise on 
all mythological scriptures states that: 'In wise men there will be lots of good qualities. and the 
stupid persons too will be with as many qualities, but they are bad in nature. So it is better to nominate 
one wise man than a thousand stupid persons as minister.'

Shlok 13: "In the world many saintly beings that are high-minded and pursuers of ethicality
are completely ruined together with their kinsmen owing to the misdeeds of others. [3-41-13]

Shlok 14: "Oh, Ravana, the subjects do not flourish while a lord with contrariety and
coerciveness safeguards them, just like goats guarded by a fox. [3-41-14]

Shlok 15: "All those demons will definitely ruin, oh, Ravana, to whom you are the acrimonious
and malicious king with unconquered senses, though you have conquered the heaven. [3-41-15]

Shlok 16: "What is the use of laming for myself as I foregathered this ghastly situation as in
crow-palm-tree syndrome, but in this issue you alone are regrettable, for you are gong to
completely ruin along with your military. [3-41-16]

[Commentary] This in Sanskrit is called kAka-tAlIya--nyAyam: 'crow-palm-tree syndrome' is one among the many compiled in that
language. Here, a fox whose leg is broken has come underneath a palm tree to take shelter from the
scorching sun, as there are no other shady trees. At the same time a crow swooped down on to the
tip of the tree, by which a palm fruit, as big and weighty as a small pinball fell on the head of
fox by the swoop of the crow, and then the misery of that fox is unexplainable. The sitting of fox,
swoop of crow, fall of fruit are all at a time and thus none can blame the other. This syndrome is
named for such fortuitous happenings.

Shlok 17: "That Rama will soon kill you after killing me, and I will be dying at the hand of
my enemy rather than at the hand of my own clansman like you, whereby the purpose of my life will
be brought to an end. [3-41-17]

[Commentary] Maareecha decides that it is better to die at the hand of Rama rather than by
Ravana; raamaat api
martavyam - martavyam raavaNaat api | ubhayod api martavye - varam raamat na raavaNaat | nR^isimha 
puraaNa  - but yet he is trying to divert Ravana from self-ruination.

Shlok 18: "Know that I am killed just when Rama notices me, and know that you are also killed
along with your kinsmen just when you steal Seetha. [3-41-18]

Shlok 19: "If you are going to bring Seetha from their hermitage on going there with me, then
you will not be there, I will not be there, Lanka will not be there, the demons will not be there.
[3-41-19]

Shlok 20: "As a desirer of your welfare I am dissuading you, oh, night-walker, but you may
feel that this word of mine is unpleasant to you. People on diminishing lifetime will be similar to
corpses and a corpse cannot take in the expedient spoken by considerate confidants, isn't so.
[3-41-20]



SARGA 42
------------------------------

[Text] On travelling by the aircraft like chariot Ravana and Maareecha enter Dandaka forest
and arrive at the threshold of Rama's hermitage. Then at the insistence of Ravana Maareecha assumes
the form of an amazing golden Deer, and Seetha catches a sight of that deer.

Shlok 1: Maareecha though curtly said in that way, then afraid of the king of night-walkers
he became self-pitying, and said to Ravana, 'let us go.' [3-42-1]

Shlok 2: "If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to only
kill me happens to see me again, deem my life is verily lost, without his shooting any arrow.
[3-42-2]

Shlok 3: "None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn't it. What is
appearing before you is the reflected image of mine, as I am already slain by the wand of Yama, the
Terminator, the moment I conceded to your demand.

Shlok 4: "When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh,
night-walker, thither I go, may good betide you." So said Maareecha to Ravana. [3-42-4]

Shlok 5: By that word of Maareecha demon Ravana is very much gladdened and he spoke this
sentence tightly hugging him. [3-42-5]

Shlok 6: "This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of my
dictate, and though you were a different night-walker earlier, henceforth you are really the good
old Maareecha. [3-42-6]

[Commentary] Some mms use the word shauNDiirya for cChauTirya , where 
shauNDiirya is the word for courageousness, shauNDiirya tyaagii viirayoH : nighanTu 
The other way to tell this is: "Though your words show the fear of my dictate, but on listening 
those obdurate words, it appears that you have spoken them for yourself, regaining the grit of your 
demon-hood and estimating Rama as your own enemy," by which Ravana is shirking his responsibility to 
Maareecha himself in the event of the death of Maareecha.

Shlok 7: "Then you promptly emplane this sky-flying chariot which is yoked with ghost-faced
mules and adorned with gems along with me. [3-42-7]

[Commentary] It may be noted that this sort of air-chariots, though richly decorated with
valuable gold and gems, but drawn by asses or mules, that too ghost-faced ones, are a kind of the
then sci-fi version of aircrafts. Ravana's son Indrajit also uses such spaceships in Yuddha Kanda
and his weaponry is altogether different, i.e., somewhat like the present day laser oriented
hardware. These propellers may not be construed as real donkeys or mules but some powered
vehicle-drawing instruments designed to look like ordinary harmless creatures.

Shlok 8: "On deluding Vaidehi it is apt of you to go as you please, and I will bring that
Seetha of Mithila, however defiant it might be." Thus Ravana said to Maareecha. [3-42-8]

[Commentary] Ravana is saying repeatedly that Maareecha can go away after beguiling Seetha
and misleading Rama and Lakshmana away from hermitage. Maareecha knows that there is no place to go
away from Rama's arrow, which once chased him up to seashore. But Ravana presumes that if Maareecha
is capable enough, he will escape Rama, or if this old demon Maareecha is incapable of it, he may
perhaps die by the arrow of Rama, for which Ravana is unconcerned.

Shlok 9- 10a: Tataka's son Maareecha said "All right" to Ravana, and then both Ravana and
Maareecha mounted the chariot as they would emplane an aircraft and swiftly journeyed from the
surroundings of Maareecha's hermitage. [3-42-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: While looking at the seaports and forests, also at all the mountains and rivers,
even at the cities and provinces en route they proceeded. [3-42-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On reaching Dandaka forest along with Maareecha the king of demons Ravana has then
seen the hermitage of Raghava. [3-42-11b, 12a]

[Commentary] Please refer to the endnote for the Ancient Indian way of classification of
villages, towns, and cities as per Indian architecture called vaastu shaastra.

Shlok 12b- 13a: Alighting the chariot that is decorated with golden ornaments Ravana then spoke this
sentence to Maareecha taking his hand into his. [3-42-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "This one which we are seeing and which is surrounded with banana plants is the
threshold of Rama's hermitage, and -`----oh, friend, the purpose for which we came here let it be
effectuated promptly." Thus Ravana hastened Maareecha. [3-42-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "And on hearing Ravana's words demon Maareecha then became a deer and indeed ambled
freely in the frontage of Rama's hermitage. [3-42-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Adopting the form of a gorgeous deer which is superbly amazing just by its
appearance, whose tips of antlers are in the hue of best sapphires, and whose face is whitish at
some places and not so whitish at other in its look, he became a Golden Deer and moved thereabout.
[3-42-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: One of its cheeks in the shade of a reddish-lotus while the other in the hue of a
bluish-lotus, one of its ears is in the hue of bloomed blue-lotus while the other is in the shade
of a sapphire, while the shine of its stomach is like that of a best blue-diamond,
Indra-niila-maNi, and with a little upraised neck that deer has moved about there. [3-42-16b,
17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: One flank is shining whitish like Madhuka flowers and the other is similar to the
roseate fibrils of lotuses, while its hooves are similar to the gemstone lapis, calves thin, and
thus with very well cohered limbs that deer moved about there. [3-42-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: With an upraised tail that shone forth in a tinge equal to the weapon of Indra,
namely Rainbow, and with a complexion that is lustrous and dappled with many diverse gemlike
dapples, that deer moved thereabout with a heart-stealing aura. [3-42-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Thus that demon Maareecha emerged like a highly splendorous and fascinating deer in
a wink highly irradiating those woodlands, and the threshold of Rama's hermitage in particular.
[3-42-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21: Adopting such an exquisite and heart-stealing form which is amazingly dappled with
the colours of diverse ores, that demon ambled all over there freely with the bearing of a real
deer in order that Vaidehi might be deluded, and he moved forward onto the pastures. [3-42-2b,
21]

Shlok 22: And with hundreds of silvery stipples of body he became an astonishing deer with
pleasant looks and indeed moved chewing new grass-blades of trees. [3-42-22]

Shlok 23: That Golden Deer has gone into the boscages of banana plants, and moved here and
there around Karnikara trees, and then resorted to a place which is within the eyeshot of Seetha.
[3-42-23]

Shlok 24: With an odd lotus like hind-side that astounding deer is verily scintillating, and
it milled around the surroundings in the threshold of Rama's hermitage according to its own
delight. [3-42-24]

Shlok 25: That excellent deer beats a retreat and again returns, and meanders thus time and
again, and turns its tail for sometime only to return once again very playfully. [3-42-25]

Shlok 26: Again gambolling everywhere it sits somewhere on the ground, then, on coming to the
threshold of hermitage it goes towards herds of deer. [3-42-26]

Shlok 27- 28a: That demon who has gone into the deer-hood has gone after some herd of deer. But he
returned again though that herd followed him wanting to fraternise, in order that he shall remain
perceptible to Seetha, and he whirligiged in amusing circles while leaping and bounding to and from
that herd of deer. [3-42-27, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: All the other animals moving in that forest on seeing this demon-deer with their
necks up have come close to it, and on smelling it well they are running away to all the ten
directions noticing it as a demon turned into a deer. [3-42-28b, 29a]

[Commentary] Here the animals are portrayed as better beings than humans in identifying
demons or ghosts. Though they may not know or wish to know about god, the apparent ghost scares
them. Humans apperceive neither god nor ghost because they are half of each.

Shlok 29b- 30a: Even that demon in the deer's semblance Maareecha, though indulged in killing those
forest animals, and though the other animals are touching him, he is not killing and eating them
indulgently, only for the reason of camouflaging his present nature of demon-hood. [3-42-29b,
30a]

Shlok 30b- 21a: What is more, Vaidehi with her felicitous eyes came towards trees yearning for
plucking the flowers in the same instant. [3-42-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: And she with her inebriating glances and delightful visage moved there about while
plucking flowers of Karnikaara, Ashoka, and of Mango trees. [3-42-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: That select lady who is unmeet for forest life beheld that deer which is completely
gemlike and whose limbs are surprising as though studded with pearls and gems. [3-42-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: And she that Seetha goggled the Golden Deer with a wide-eyed astonishment, which
deer has pretty lips and teeth, hair resembling silver and copper ores, and she indeed gazed at it
with an affinity for wildlife. [3-42-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: On seeing Rama's wife Seetha that highly phantasmal deer too then moved there about
as though to scintillate that woodland. [3-42-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b: To see such a deer which is hitherto unseen, and which is as though studded with
numerous gems, the daughter of Janaka, Seetha, went in to an intense wonderment. [3-42-35b, c]

[Commentary] The stress continuously laid on the eyes of Seetha is observable, only to
conclude that 'trust not what thy eyes show you...'

[Commentary] The vaastu shaastra or the Ancient Indian Architecture lays down certain 
parameters for Towns, cities etc. Of them the township is said to be aneka naarii sambaddham nanaa 
shilpi janaiH vR^itam | kraya vikrayaiH kiirNam sarva devaiH samanvitam nagaram tu iti vikhyaatam 
adored with many ladies, many sculptors or architects, and with many deities, and where the buying and 
selling goes on it is nagaram the township.

[Commentary] The Seaports are said as: 
pattanam shR^iNu saampratam | dviipaantara gata dravya kraya vikrayikaiH yutam | pattanam tu abdhi tiire 
syaat | one which has all the above aspects but which is at seaside, it is
pattanam seaport. The township between a nagara 
and puram is kharvaTam

[Commentary] And the City is:

kraya vikrayaiH yutam naanaa jaati samanvitam | tantuvaaya samaayuktam tat puram tu vikathyateThe 
one with all the above aspects plus very many civilisations and weavers and the like craftsmen, is
purii, the city. Apart from these, the royal places, army stations etc., 
do comprise the ten varieties of urban places as said in the above verse, where the village is the first 
unit.



SARGA 43
------------------------------

[Text] On spotting the deer Seetha calls Rama and Lakshmana to have sight of it. Lakshmana immediately concludes 
it to be Maareecha, but Seetha, keeping his observation aside asks Rama to fetch it. Rama is also fascinated 
when he looked at that deer and he explains to Lakshmana as to why that particular deer is to be hunted 
down.

Shlok 1: That slender-waisted Seetha whose limbs are flawless, whose complexion is like purified gold, and who 
is presently culling flowers is highly gladdened to observe the Golden Deer that is brightened in one 
flank with the colour of gold and the other is silvery, and she shouted for attention of her husband, 
and even that of Lakshmana who is presently weaponed. [3-43-1, 2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, noble prince, come here," thus she called her husband and peered at the deer, and again she called, 
"really come with your younger brother quickly," and again gazed at the deer, and thus she oftentimes 
called and oftentimes saw the deer fondly. [3-43-3]

Shlok 4: Those manly lions Rama and Lakshmana thus bidden by Vaidehi came there exploring that place and then 
they saw that Golden Deer. [3-43-4]

Shlok 5: But Lakshmana became incredulous on seeing it and said to Rama, "I believe this deer to be that Maareecha, 
the demon." [3-43-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh, Rama, when kings engaged in hunting games were delightedly moving in the forest, this Maareecha 
killed many of them resorting to many disguises, for he is a guise-changer by his wish. [3-43-6]

Shlok 7: "Maareecha is an expert in many wiles and he has now assumed the form of this Golden-Deer, oh, manly 
lion, which is not more than the scintillating city of Gandharva-s, a city of wiles, which any trickster 
can create to make-believe. [3-43-7]

[Commentary] The 'Gandharva-city' is the name given to a make-believe formation of a city-like structure in skies 
by magicians, and presently the magicians world over are making the apparent structures to disappear, 
rather than constructing one which is un-manifest.

Shlok 8: "Oh, Raghava, this kind of amazing animal with gemlike dapples is nonexistent in the world, isn't it. 
Hence, oh, lord of the world, this is truly a phantasm. No doubt about it." So said Lakshmana to Rama. 
[3-43-8]

[Commentary] Here the timely provision of data by Lakshmana may be noticed. Rama is also aware of it, but Lakshmana 
is reminding him. Lakshmana cites even the name of Maareecha and by this, we can infer as to why Ravana 
chose Maareecha for this particular purpose. Because Maareecha has that extraordinary ability to lure 
and has a good record of wily accomplishments, Ravana chose him. Lakshmana has done his duty in presenting 
expedient data and it is up to Rama to analyse it. Rama argues on this point later in the chapter.

Shlok 9: While Lakshmana of Kakutstha-s is speaking thus, she who is self-satisfied as her heart is conjured 
by the cozenage, such a Seetha of a toothy smile deterred him and spoke. [3-43-9]

Shlok 10: "Oh, nobleman's son, that delightful deer is stealing my heart, oh, dextrous one, bring it round, it 
will be our plaything. [3-43-10]

Shlok 11: "Here in the threshold of our hermitage many animals with adorable manifestation are moving about in 
flocks and herds, say Caamara deer, like that Srimara deer. [3-43-11]

[Commentary] The chaamara is the kind of deer of species Bos grunniens and shrimara is a larger 
variety than chaamara.

Shlok 12: "Also the animals that are excellent in their form, say monkeys, are moving here. Likewise herds of 
Kinnara deer, spotted-deer, and even bears of great-might are freely moving here. [3-43-12]

[Commentary] Here the Kinnaraa-s are another kind of deer and not to be confounded with yaksha, gandharva, kinnaraa 
celestials.

Shlok 13: "As to how this extraordinary deer is appearing, oh, king, by way of its brilliance, tameness, or by 
the lustre of its skin, I have not so far seen any coequal to this. [3-43-13]

Shlok 14: "Diversely coloured, amazingly limbed, and spotted with gemlike dapples it is shining forth like a deer 
that is completely gemmy, and while nonchalantly moving before me it is enlivening the forest like the 
moon. [3-43-14]

Shlok 15: "Ah, what a form, ah, what a brilliance, what a beautiful bleat! This amazingly limbed deer is wonderful, 
and this is stealing my heart, as it were. [3-43-15]

Shlok 16: "It will be surprising if this deer draws into your capture alive and well, as it creates astonishment 
to one and all. [3-43-16]

Shlok 17: "When we return to kingdom on completing our dwelling in forest this deer becomes a masterpiece in palace-chambers 
for us. [3-43-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, lord, the form of this deer creates an excellent jubilation to Bharata, to you the son of the nobleman, 
to my mothers-in-law, and also to me in palace-chambers. [3-43-18]

Shlok 19: "Else if that best deer does not come into you capture while alive, oh tigerly-man, at the least its 
gorgeous deerskin will be remnant of it. [3-43-19]

Shlok 20: "I wish to sit along with you on its golden deerskin, overlaying it on a seat of tender darbha grass-blades, 
in case the deer is felled. [3-43-20]

[Commentary] The seat of those that are under a vow is called bR^isii, vratiinaam aasanam bR^isii, ajina, carma, 
kR^ittiH : amara kosha 'A seat covered with darbha, the sacred grass, [and if available] a deerskin 
thereon.'

Shlok 21: "Tradition says that this sort of unruly self-seeking is unbefitting to women, yet that deer's beautiful 
body is inducing curiosity in me." Seetha said so to Rama and remained waiting for his reply. [3-43-21]

[Commentary] Seetha talked only this much and left the fulfilment of her indent to the discretion of Rama. There 
is neither demand nor compulsion to bring the deer in her talk. But we usually hear the telltale stories, 
bringing from some other texts, which say that Seetha pestered, nagged, and harassed Rama to get this 
deer. But nothing of that sort is evident from the dialogue given to her by Valmiki. She started to 
ask Rama with a suchiH smitaH 'a white smile, i.e., a toothy smile or a simpering smile' that too to 
deride the security guard, namely Lakshmana. These security personnel all over the world and in all 
situations and always forewarn the secured, and on the other hand, it is customary to the secured person 
to jump off the cordon of security, disdainful of the security measures. After all, human nature wants 
a free living. Thus, when Seetha is trying to jump off the cordon of security laid by Lakshmana, commentators 
say that she is said to have smiled scornfully. lakshmaNa vaakya shravaNa janita kopaa siitaa raamam 
eva aaha - dk 'with the anger generated on listening Lakshmana's words, Seetha spoke to Rama,' 
Whether Seetha is with kopa 'anger' or not, it is unsaid in the text.

Shlok 22- 23a: As for that deer's horns they vie with excellent sapphires, its golden coat with the glitter of tender 
sun, and its ambience with silver spots on coat with a milk way containing twinkling stars, and by that 
reason even Raghava's heart is awestruck when he saw it. [3-43-22, 23a]

[Commentary] According to this original text, Rama is more lured by the Golden Deer than Seetha, whereas later legends 
made Seetha a scapegoat. Rama too did not fancifully come under the lure but he got his own logistics 
to fall after the deer, which we come across in the following speeches of Rama. The word api 'even,' 
is a normal metrical filler at most times, but assumes importance at times. Here Rama is the all knowing 
and all deciding personality as depicted until now, and 'even' he is lured by the deer, say Maareecha's 
supernal trickery.

Shlok 23b- 24: In this way, hearing the words of Seetha and observing that wondrous deer Raghava is also amused by 
its form, and even motivated by Seetha in fetching it, he delightedly spoke this word to his brother 
Lakshmana. [3-43-23b, 24]

[Commentary] When Seetha placed her indent before Rama, Rama is speaking to Lakshmana, only to allow us to listen 
his strategy in going after the deer. atra mR^igayaa vyasana doShaan jaanan api raamo - lobhitaH 
ten ruupeNa - iti anayo uktayaa mahaa purusaanatra mR^igayaa vyasana doSaan jaanan api raamo - lobhitaH 
ten ruupeNa - iti anayo uktayaa mahaa puru//saanaam api bhavati vyasana anuruupatayaa buddhi vyaamoho

[Commentary] 'here knowing well about the blemishes of hunting games, Rama is lured, ambitioned, hankered 
after etc. By these words it is suggested that even great people are beguiled for their inclination 
in such matters - Dharmaakuutam;

[Commentary] asambhave hemamayasya jantoH tathaa api raamo lulubhe mR^igaaya | sabhaa parva - bhaarata - raamo 
hema mR^igam na vetti - - - dyuute bhraatR^i catuSTayam ca mahiSiim dharmaatmajo dattavaan | praayaH 
sat puruSo hi anartha samaye buddhyaa parityajyate - - praaciinaa

[Commentary] 'even if it is impossible to have a golden deer, Rama is lured by it for his hunting game' Maha 
Bharata, sabhaa parva ; 'Rama, unable to distinguish illusory deer [went after it...] Yudhistar staked 
all his four brothers and his queen [in dice game...] thus even great people at inopportune times loose 
their brains,' an ancient saying.

Shlok 25: "Lakshmana, behold this enthusiastic delight of Vaidehi. Oh, Soumitri, presently no other deer indeed 
with such an excellent form exists in this forest. Or else, does it exist in Nandana Gardens of Indra 
- no, it cannot be there; in the adjoins of Caitraratha Gardens of Kubera - no, it will not be there, 
then how can there be some deer on earth which is similar to this! [3-43-25, 26]

Shlok 27: "Amazing are its hairlines with hair upturned at some places and down-turned at other, and the golden 
spots embedded on the coat of the deer are glittery. [3-43-27]

Shlok 28: "See at its tongue that is exserting from its mouth while it is yawning, which is similar to the flaring 
tongue of fire and to the lightning from a cloud. [3-43-28]

Shlok 29: "Its face is like a mug made up of sapphires, its paunch is pearly and conchoidal, and whose heart is 
it that will not lured for this deer with an inexplicable beauty. [3-43-29]

Shlok 30: "On seeing at this astounding look of the deer which is golden in glitter and bejewelled numerously 
as it were, whose heart is it that will not be transported into astonishment. [3-43-30]

Shlok 31: "Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the 
sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery. [3-43-31]

Shlok 32: "And exerting themselves in great forests they by far amass forest produce, ores, jewels, gemstones 
and the gravel of gold. [3-43-32]

[Commentary] 'And this deer is also the produce of this forest, as such hunting this for taming or tanning is befitting 
to us, as we are princes.' One should not 'exert oneself,' or 'amass' forest produce even if he is a 
king, but collect it casually without looting it.

Shlok 33: "Everything of that wealth from forest produce will be filling the treasuries of kings, like the speculated 
objects filling the entire treasury of Shukra just by his thinking of them in his mind. [3-43-33]

[Commentary] Whatever object Shukra thinks wilfully, it becomes a reality, filling his treasury. So also, whatever 
objects the kings desire they come to reality through forest produce. This is a puranic/ legendary saying 
which Rama is quoting.

[Commentary] Or, as contained in Maha Bharata, Udyoga Parva, Suparna-Narada discourse: manuShyebhya samaadatte 
shukraH cintaa aarjitam dhanam 'the pipedreams, [the unattainable or fanciful hopes or schemes,] 
of people fill up the coffers of Shukra.'

[Commentary] Or, dhaninaam kosha vardhanam dhanam saaram 'for rich people [like kings, merchants,] coffer, 
filling, wealth, i.e., the forest produce is the best.' 'The forest produce is the best wealth for enriching 
the coffers of the kings for maintenance of kingdom, and for other rich people it is for trade etc.' 
Hence, this deer, or its deerskin is saaram 'an excellent gift' to be taken to Ayodhya on our 
return.' Rama's saying is interpreted in this way giving a high priority to forest produce.

Shlok 34: "The financial experts and the other financially well-off people say that with which aspirational activity 
an aspirant unhesitatingly scurries and achieves it, that achieved target alone is lauded to be worthwhile, 
or, as real wealth. [3-43-34]

[Commentary] To support his argument that bringing the Golden Deer shall not become a pipedream but it shall occur 
in reality, Rama is substantiating with this statement. This is called apuurva vastu sekaraNa 
'collection of valuable objects' which is a fashion to anyone, especially to kings. Then Lakshmana may 
further insist 'even then you shall not go, it is a fanciful deer/demon,' for which Rama is saying 'getting 
the un-gettable itself is worthwhile.'

Shlok 35: "This comely Vaidehi will be sitting on that invaluable golden skin of that gem of a deer along with 
me. [3-43-35]

[Commentary] Rama is not primarily bothered to tame the Golden Deer by declaring about its skin and its usage at 
this juncture. This skin alone is the 'laudable wealth' 'worthwhile object' and a 'masterpiece.'

Shlok 36: "I think the skin of Kadali deer, or of Priyaki deer, or of Praveni deer, or as a matter of fact the 
skins of best breed of deer or sheep will not be match to the deerskin of this deer, insofar as the 
soft-touch is concerned. [3-43-36]

[Commentary] Kadali, Priaki and Avi are the names of breed of deer that yield best deerskins. It is said in amara 
kosha: kadalii kandalii ciinaH ca camuuru priyakaH; amii ajina yonayaH; avayaH shaila meSa arka 
Kadali is the deer with white stripes on its neck that lives in a big burrows. Priyaki will have thick 
brown and black hair and these yield the best and soft deerskin for sitting. AviH is the sheep in breed. 
The word Praveni may perhaps not of a breed of deer as said in amara kosha: aiNeya meNyaaH carmaadyameNaH 
aiNam ubhe triSu Thus it conveys the meaning aiNeya, the best deer belonging to doe, and aiNa, 
belonging to buck. Some take this praveNi as a separate breed whose dictionary meaning is completely 
different than that of deer.

Shlok 37: "Only two divine deer are there, this magnificent deer on earth, and the other that moves in skies remaining 
in stellar region. [3-43-37]

[Commentary] The deer in skies is taken in two ways; one, the deer in the moon and the other, the Orion constellation,
mR^iga shiirSa, mR^iga shira 'deer, as its head,' i.e., the deer-like stars in the head of 
Orion, where East takes this Orion as the 'hunted' and West takes it as the 'hunter', in which 'hunting' 
is common. And Rama wants to hunt down the reality of the deer. But Lakshmana may still insist saying, 
'maybe, only these two deer are the unavailable objects. We cannot leap up to skies to catch hold of 
those deer-like stars, or the deer in the moon. Equally this tricky deer on earth is uncatchable. Thereby 
getting its skin is also that dreamy.' For this Rama explains his duty in his next course of action, 
viz., killing the demon.

Shlok 38: "You are telling me that 'this is the wizardry of the demon.' Even then, Lakshmana, if this results 
in that way as a demon's wizardry, my duty also results in the elimination of that deer. [3-43-38]

Shlok 39: "If this deer is Maareecha, this heinous and vicious-souled demon has indeed tortured many eminent sages 
earlier when was on the prowl in the forests, thus he is eliminable. [3-43-39]

Shlok 40: "He rebelliously killed many kings who are excellent archers while they were in hunting games, at least 
for that reason this bestial monster is eradicable. [3-43-40]

[Commentary] The last word in second foot mR^iga is also identifiable with 'beast' thus a bestial monster.

Shlok 41: "Demon Vaataapi who held ascetics in contempt was here earlier, and staying in the stomachs of Brahmans 
he used to come out by ripping their stomachs open and thus he was killing Brahmans, like a mare-calf 
killing its own mother at its time of birth by ripping the womb of its own mother. [3-43-41]

[Commentary] The legend of Vaataapi is said in detail in chapter 11 of this Aranya Kanda when Rama and others were 
going to Agastya's hermitage.

Shlok 42: "On one occasion after some time, that Vaataapi avariciously obtained that great-saint and the one who 
is endowed with effulgent, namely Agastya, as an eatable, but actually that demon has became an eatable 
to the sage. [3-43-42]

Shlok 43: "On observing the demon Vaataapi who is trying to assume his original form of demon in order to come 
out of his stomach, that godly saint Agastya spoke this to Vaataapi with a scornful smile. [3-43-43]

Shlok 44: " 'Oh, Vaataapi, you have irreverently eradicated the best Brahmans in this world owing to your might, 
therefore I have assimilated you.' So said sage Agastya to Vaataapi. [3-43-44]

Shlok 45- 46a: "Lakshmana, such a demon who is like Vaataapi will not be there any more. He who disregards someone 
of my kind, who always abides in righteousness and who is self-controlled, such a demon will be eliminated 
as sage Agastya has eliminated demon Vaataapi, if that demon happens to get at me. [3-43-45, 46a]

Shlok 46b- 47a: "Oh, Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, you stay here in all preparedness and guard Maithili steadfastly, 
whatever enterprise of ours is there that is founded in her. [3-43-46b, 47a]

[Commentary] The first foot 'she is the basis of our mission' is a debated expression. Their mission is to eliminate 
Ravana. Seetha as Vedavati, an earlier incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi, vows to eliminate Ravana when 
she comes to earth as Seetha. Then Rama should have said 'look Lakshmana, our task is to kill Ravana, 
for that Ravana has to kidnap Seetha, and to make that kidnapping possible do not guard her.' Can he 
say so? Neither Rama, nor any ordinary husband can say so. Then this predictive sentence becomes self-contrary. 
Contrariwise, taking some concessions of grammar, because most of Ramayana is un-Paninian, Rama is indirectly 
hinting Lakshmana that something is immanent, because 'after the elimination of demons like Khara, Duushana 
nothing drastic has happened, but a queer deer has come, and thus something may now happen.' Then, if 
this asyaam is given to kartavyam 'the enterprise' as tasmin then the connection 
is: asmaakam yat kR^ityam asyaam [tasmin] aayattam asaama 'for us, which, enterprise is there, 
in that, circumspect, we shall be' 'Which enterprise is there for us individually, in that we both shall 
conduct separately and circumspectly, and you do your job of guarding Seetha and I mine in bringing 
the deer or its skin, duly eliminating that conjuring demon.' In such a case, the blemish soothsaying 
or prophesising will not occur to Rama, in saying 'Seetha as the pivotal character is to be kidnapped 
by Ravana' etc. In fact, Rama is the person who is more beguiled by the deer.

Shlok 47b- 48a: "I wish to catch this deer, Soumitri, if not I will kill it, and I will be going forthwith to fetch 
the deer. [3-43-47b, 48a]

Shlok 48b- 49a: "Lakshmana, see how Vaidehi's percept is overtaken by deerskin. Indeed by the strangeness of its skin 
that deer must be a mysterious being, hence, it will not survive now. [3-43-48]

Shlok 49b- 50: "Oh, Lakshmana, apply yourself vigilantly while staying in hermitage along with Seetha. So soon as I 
go I will be felling that spotted deer with one arrow and returning quickly. [3-43-49b, 50]

[Commentary] The ambiguity is whether Rama is going for the deer, or deerskin, or for the latent demon. He is going 
for the deer epically, for the memento of deerskin to Seetha as a hero of the epic, and for the demon 
in deer, according to mythology.

Shlok 51: "Oh, Lakshmana, you be here taking care of Maithili along with the forthright, formidable and fatherly 
bird Jatayu, and be watchful and suspicious from everywhere and every split-second." Thus Rama spoke 
to Lakshmana and started to go after the deer [3-43-51]

[Commentary] Poor Seetha, she could not romanticise the Golden 
Deer better than Rama. Then it may be asked 'what is the necessity for Rama to romanticise and compare 
it to the skyey star-deer and others. Is it for the deer or for the deerskin?' This is the unanswered 
question. 'It is for the deer alone but not its skin,' said so in reply by some. If it were to be for 
the deerskin, from the view point of Rama, he could have shot his arrow from where he is standing, which 
arrow miraculously pierces any terrain, kills the deer, and safely comes back into his quiver, as in 
the case of showing his prowess to Sugreeva. Otherwise, Rama should have turned down the request of 
Seetha, as he did in the ninth chapter of this Aranya Kanda, when she was saying: 'where that weapon? 
Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? And where is the sageness? All this is inconsistent... 
By us, let the laws of the land be esteemed...' as at 3-9-27. When kings come into such a sort of allurement, 
many wise men quote this instance of Rama's going after the deer as a reminder to them, as in Maha Bharata.

[Commentary] "Impossible is the birth of a Golden Deer, even 
then Rama is lured, if time is perilous, even the best man's brain deranges.'

[Commentary] Fate harasses the faculty, faculty cannot harass 
the fate, even the cleverest Rama, went after the Golden Deer.

[Commentary] Unborn it was, none has seen yet, nor mentioned 
about it, such is the mirage of Rama. Parlous time causes perilous percipience.

[Commentary] Hence Rama's 
going after the deer is for the deerskin, on one count, and for the deer itself, on the other as affirmed 
by Lakshmana because Lakshmana never says untruth. This Maareecha is recurrently falling after Rama. 
Once an accident, twice a coincidence, but thrice... a habituation... and it become habitual for Maareecha 
to dare Rama. Hence, Rama has to do something to Maareecha, permanently.

[Commentary] The other view according to puranic/mythological 
sayings is that god endows whatever you seek. But that god alone says: 'Seek you will get it, but seek 
not by the extrinsic values of objects.' This saying has it counterpart at: 'Every one that asketh receiveth; 
and he that seeketh findeth.' St Matthew, p[Ch. 7, v. 8] The Bible. But 'seek something within the nature, 
according to your nature... but not the supernatural... for eyes belie the nature of objects...' is 
the essence here. He/she who seeks beyond means will have to suffer, either by getting it or devoid 
of it. This is said in innuendo at 3-43-33, that 'the results of pipedreams fill the coffers of Shukra.'

[Commentary] Further, because parlous 
time has come to Rama and Seetha, epically, providentially, and episodically, Rama has to move away 
from Seetha. While going after the deer, Rama says much to Lakshmana about the security to Seetha and 
also informs him that 'she is pivotal to our mission.' He did not say these many farewells when sending 
Seetha and Lakshmana for hiding in a cave at the time of elimination Khara, Duushana, and the other 
fourteen thousand demons. At one time Rama spared Maareecha's life in the forest of Tataka while guarding 
Vishwamitra's ritual, only to cause Maareecha to come now. As such, Rama has to go after Maareecha. 
Besides, Seetha or Goddess Lakshmi will let none killed in her presence.



SARGA 44
------------------------------

[Text] Rama eliminates Maareecha when he is escaping beyond reach in the form of Golden
Deer. He sports with that deer for a long time and when it is leading him away and afar from the
hermitage, he is vexed with the trickery of the deer and kills it. At the time of his death
Maareecha shouts out for Seetha and Lakshmana, as demanded by Ravana. Rama is perplexed at this
oddity of Maareecha and presumes that some danger is immanent and then returns to hermitage.

Shlok 1: Rama, the great-resplendent scion of Raghu, on instructing his brother Lakshmana in
that way securely fastened his sword with golden handle to his waist. [3-44-1]

Shlok 2: Rama whose valour is escalating then took his own insignia, the three-way arched bow
called kodanDa, and fastened two quivers and proceeded. [3-44-2]

Shlok 3: On peering at the peerless one among kings, namely Rama, who is indeed coming down
on him, that Golden Deer disappeared as if with fear and even to beguile him, and again it came
into clear visibility. And Rama speedily spurted to that place from where the Golden Deer has
firstly disappeared with securely grit sword and firmly handled bow. [3-44-3]

Shlok 4b- 5- 6- 7a: Rama the wielder of bow kept on beholding that Golden Deer which is observing him
over and over and running away into deep of the forest. In the next moment he has seen it right in
front of him as though effulgent with its marvellous form. At times he has seen it running away as
though to circumvent the fall of arrow, and at times stopping only to tantalise him. Sometimes it
appeared to be springing as though to skies in very highly perplexity of wariness. It is
disappearing somewhere in the thickets of forest, and it is putting in an appearance elsewhere in
those thickets, like the autumnal orb of the moon under the fly front of splintered clouds.
[3-44-4b, 5, 6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8: In a wink Rama could proximately see that Maareecha who transformed himself into the
Golden Deer, and again in a flash he appeared distantly. Thus that deer/demon has drawn off Raghava
very far from his hermitage in this hide and seek game. [3-44-7b, 8]

Shlok 9: Rama of Kakutstha is incensed as its form is spellbinding but its capture slippery,
and then verily tired as he is he stayed on a pasture taking shelter of a tree shade. [3-44-9]

Shlok 10: Nightwalker Maareecha has further maddened Rama in the guise of Golden Deer by
reappearing in his close-by, surrounded with other animals of the forest. [3-44-10]

Shlok 11: Again on seeing Rama who is stalking his catch that deer ran towards him as though
to impress with its guilelessness, and just at that moment it vanished again as if with extreme
fear. [3-44-11]

Shlok 12: Then that deer has again emerged out of the thick of trees, and on spotting it the
great-resplendent Rama has firmed up his decision to fell it. [3-44-12]

Shlok 13- 14- 15a: At that instant Raghava became highly infuriated and unholstered a holocaustic,
enemy-subjugating arrow that is similar to the flare of the sun, tautening it on his very sturdy
bow that forceful Rama forcefully outstretched the bowstring with arrow targeting the Golden Deer
alone, and released that fierily blazing arrow-missile which is carefully created by Brahma and
which is hissing like a snake. [3-44-13, 14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: On very profoundly impaling the body of deer's form that superb arrow which is
similar to a thunderbolt has severed the heart of Maareecha in the core of deer's body. [3-44-15b,
16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then Maareecha is highly frenzied as his lifespan is minimised, blared a blaring
shriek, vaulted up to a height of palm-tree, and fell down onto the ground. [3-44-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: Maareecha on his part abandoned the body of Golden Deer when he is dying. But
remembering the words of Ravana that demon gave a thought, 'how best will Seetha hasten Lakshmana
to this place, and how best Ravana can abduct Seetha in a place void of people.' [3-44-17b, 18]

[Commentary] Maareecha would have died without yelling for Lakshmana or Seetha as tutored by
Ravana because Maareecha is no real alley of Ravana. But it is said that he 'recollected Ravana's
words and thought about it.' What he really thought is the causation of death to that one who
caused his own death, namely Ravana. Ravana can do nothing to Maareecha now as Maareecha is
breathing his last. Whatever is to be done now it has t become a self-ruinous act to Ravana. Hence,
it is better to do as said by Ravana for the elimination of Ravana. So thought Maareecha.

Shlok 19: Perceptive of the time that chanced bearing his death, and wishful of the death of
Ravana too, then made a voice that is a soundalike to Raghava's voice and yelled 'ha, Seetha...'
also thus 'ha Lakshmana...' [3-44-19]

Shlok 20- 21a: When Rama's incomparable arrow has indeed shattered his crucial organ, namely the
heart, in a downright manner, then Maareecha assumed a very massive physique of a demon, abandoning
the form of Golden Deer. [3-44-20, 21a]

[Commentary] Though Maareecha assumed the form of a deer he has to retain his heart and brain
of a demon. This is the yogic way of para kaaya praveshanam 'entering other bodies.' These
assumed artificial bodies do not hold ground in nidraa, surata, maraNa dasheSu 'in sleep,
copulation and death states,' where the mind, if distracted to these states, cannot concentrate or
hold the body that is assumed by mental powers of yoga. Here no supernal god or deity is involved
to grant such a capacity but one's own practise achieves it. Whereas in other case like Ravana,
gods have bestowed boons, so he need not practise such yoga etc., as he is blessed to be above
these mortal's practises and thus can change his form and can rejoice in any state with that body
or form. This is how he abducts Seetha changing his semblances instantaneously.

Shlok 21b- 22: On seeing that demon with a fiendish look, who has fallen to earth with limbs
steeped in blood, and who is weltering on the surface of earth, Rama emotionally took flight to
Seetha reminiscing Lakshmana's words. [3-44-21b, 22]

Shlok 23: "This is the trickery of Maareecha which Lakshmana vouchsafed earlier, that has
indeed happened in that way alone, and the one whom I have killed now is none other than Maareecha.
[3-44-23]

Shlok 24: "This demon died while crying out with a blatant voice 'ha, Seetha... ha,
Lakshmana...' And on hearing this how Seetha will be? And what will be the plight of dextrous
Lakshmana?" Thus on thinking over them that righteous-souled Rama remained in a hair-raising
predicament. [3-44-24]

Shlok 26: On killing that demon in the form of Golden Deer, and also on hearing his yelling,
Rama is ensorcelled with a frantic fear caused by his own gloom. [3-44-26]

Shlok 27: Raghava then on killing another spotted deer and on taking its flesh, he hurried
himself towards Janasthaana. [3-44-27]

[Commentary] As with any other demon's death Maareecha's 
death also is eulogised as a merited one and reading or listening this is said to bring merit. 
Though these results are not said in Ramayana proper, its collateral scripts like
skaanda purana, aadhyaatma raamaayaNa etc., say them. For the 
elimination of Maareecha aadhyaatma raamaayaNa says:

[Commentary] From that body of Maareecha a divine aureole 
risen while all the world is seeing... that merged into Rama alone, causing very great 
astonishment... this is the marvel of Rama, nothing else..' So the divine beings thought seeing from 
heavens, and said 'a Brahman or a demon, or a sinner or meritorious one who cites the name of Rama 
at the time of leaving his body, he attains the Ultimate Threshold...' Blessing so, the divine 
beings returned to their abodes on seeing the salvation of Maareecha's soul in Rama.'
aadhyaatma raamaayaNa, aranya , seventh sarga/chapter.



SARGA 45
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha rebukes Lakshmana for he is still here, loitering away even after listening Rama's cry for help. 
She goes to the extent of slandering him as having intents to woo her, at the cost of Rama's life. Lakshmana 
tries to pacify her but in vain, as she persists in her rash talk. Lakshmana leaves her alone and starts 
to reach Rama, broken-heartedly.



This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. 
The sublimity of Seetha's characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether 
Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature 
as to 'why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some 
rains and go...' If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against 
her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called 
a woman who is bhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi 'blinded by the devotement to her 
husband...' 'a desirer of her husband's welfare...' even at her own risk.



This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It is raama ayana and becomes raamaayaNa when 
compounded. Again raama is not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is also raamaa as 
said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. 60, 10th verse:

[Commentary] 'like an young girl Seetha, with not so young moon's face, [i.e., like the full moon,] is delighting 
herself even in uninhabited forests with Rama...'



Thus this epic is called raamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam 'the peregrination of Seetha and 
Rama...' where the first word raamaa with elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the 
second raama with shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination 
of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, 
and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation 
occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, 
good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that 
of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no 
oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote.

Shlok 1: On identifying the grievous voice that is identifiable with her husband's voice, Seetha spoke to Lakshmana, 
"you go at once, and check up on Raghava.' [3-45-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "I have heard the loud yelling voice of highly fretful Rama whereby my heart, or my very entity, is 
not abiding in its place, and it will be apt of you to protect such a brother of yours who is screaming 
in the forest. [3-45-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: "He might have come under the subjugation of demons as with a bull coming under the seize of lions, 
hence, you hurry up so as to near such a brother of yours who is seeking protection." So said Seetha 
toi Lakshmana. [3-45-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: Although she spoke a lot to him in this way, Lakshmana on his part has not moved out remembering his 
brother's order to stay guard to Seetha, and hence that Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, who is already 
agitated for Rama further spoke to him in the paradox of his not going out of hermitage. [3-45-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: "You are like a foe of your brother in friend's mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards 
a brother even if he is in an emergency. [3-45-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you 
are not following up on Raghava. It is definite. [3-45-6b, 7a]

[Commentary] The 'real' woman in Seetha is coming out. From now on, she goes on talking unhesitatingly, unilaterally 
and even abusively because her mind is fuddled with the thought 'some damage is being done to her husband.'

Shlok 7b- 8a: " 'Raghava in direst strait' is the most liked thing to you, thus I deem, as you have no heart for that 
brother, and as you complacently stay behind even when that great-resplendent Rama is unseen. [3-45-7b, 
8a]

Shlok 8-9a: "After which helmsman you have come here that Rama is undergoing an uncertainty of life-and-death, as 
such I indeed wonder what business you have here now in staying with me at this hermitage?" Seetha spoke 
so to Lakshmana. [3-45-8, 9a]

Shlok 9b-10a: Lakshmana spoke to Seetha, the princess from Videha kingdom, who is talking deluged under tears and 
anguish in that way, as she is fretful like a she-deer. [3-45-9a, 10b]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Oh, Vaidehi, your husband is an impossible one for vincibility by serpents, asura-s, gandharva-s, gods, 
fiends, demons, no doubt about it.

Shlok 11b- 12- 13a: "Oh, auspicious one, unmarked is some combatant who can counterattack Rama from among gods, humans, 
gandharva-s, birds, ogres, kinnaraa-s, beasts, or oh, lady, even from horrendous demons, as Rama vies 
with Indra in any given war. [3-45-11b, 12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "It is inapt of you to talk that way as Rama is inextirpable in a given war, and as for me, I do not 
venture to abandon you in this forest in the absence of Raghava. [3-45-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Let the most forceful Crowns with all their military forces, or, all of the gods together with their 
heads, why they, let all the three worlds put together come mutinously, whether jointly or severally, 
Rama's prowess is irrestrainable. [3-45, 14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b-16a: "Hence, let your heart be diverted and anxiety divested, as your husband will be returning soon on killing 
that extraordinary deer. [3-45-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "Evidently it is not the voice of Rama, nor that of any other god, but someone mimicked that voice for 
chicanery, and that must be the illusory voice of that demon Maareecha, similar in effect to the magical 
city of gandharva-s usually created by magicians in general. [3-45-15b, 16]

[Commentary] Lakshmana has repeated the word gandharva nagara which he said to Rama. This magic is said as: gandharva 
nagaram proktam indrajaalam maniiShibhiH 'magic show of showing celestial cities by magicians.'

Shlok 17-18a: "And you are an entrustment, oh, best lady Vaidehi, as the great-souled Rama has entrusted you in my 
security, as such I do not dare to leave you off now. [3-45-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "Oh, gracious lady, we have become the adversaries of these night-walkers insofar as the elimination 
of Khara and others, and concerning the eradication of Janasthaana. [3-45-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "The demons are the swaggerers in violence in great forests and they will be employing various voices. 
Therefore Vaidehi, just do not bother about it." Thus Lakshmana advised Seetha. [3-45-18b, 19, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: As for Seetha, she became furious on hearing Lakshmana's words of advice, and while her eyes are becoming 
bloodshot she spoke these rude sentences to that veracious Lakshmana. [3-45-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: "You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem 
that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama. [3-45-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] The wording anaaryaH akararuNaarambha= dayaa prasakti rahitaH is as per the text of Govindaraja, 
while other mms have it as akaarya karaNa aarambha; a kaarya kaaraNa aarambha 'starter for 
doing an untoward deed.' From Seetha's viewpoint it is 'in wooing brother's wife you are the starter 
of an untoward deed.'

Shlok 22b- 23: "You are haranguing all these sermons only on noticing hardship to Rama. It is unsurprising that the 
pitiless ones and rivals of your kind, who always behave in a cloak-and dagger way, will tend to commit 
deadly sins, Lakshmana, and it is not uncommon. [3-45-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: "You are verily maleficent for you have singly and covertly followed Rama, who started to forests all 
alone, or instigated by Bharata, only because of me. [3-45-24]

[Commentary] The covert operation of Lakshmana as instantly surmised by Seetha is that, 'when one half-brother Bharata 
can snatch the kingdom from Rama, you, the other half-brother, can snatch away his wife, hence you have 
come with covert intentions, on your own, leaving all your kinsfolk. Or, Bharata wanted me too along 
with the kingdom, so he might have instigated you to fetch me for him, after Rama's death, thus he covertly 
sent 'you' alone.'

Shlok 25- 26a: "Whether this is an intrigue of yours or that of Bharata it is unachievable, Saumitri. How can I long 
for another commoner when I have put my faith only in the lotus-blue-complexioned and lotus-bright-eyed 
husband of mine, Rama? [3-45-25, 26a]

[Commentary] For how shall I, the chosen bride / Of dark-hued Rama, lotus-eyed, / The queen who once called Rama 
mine, To love of other men decline? - Griffith.

Shlok 26b- 27a: "If that comes to that, I will just discard my life in your presence, Soumitri do not mistake it. I 
do not eke out an existence on this earth even for a moment without Rama." Thus Seetha threatened Lakshmana. 
[3-45-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: When that self-mortified Lakshmana is addressed in this way with hair-raising and acerbic words by Seetha, 
he spoke to her suppliantly adjoining his palm-fold. [3-45-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29: "I do not venture to reply you Maithili, as you are like a deity to me. Women using words that are in 
a class by themselves is not at all surprising. This sort of bringing stilted words into play is the 
nature of women and it is obvious in the world. [3-45-28b, 29]

Shlok 30- 31a: "Women by their nature are unbound by the etiquette of decency, whimsical, cantankerous and they tend 
to become the artificers of vicissitudes, and oh, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka, indeed unbearable 
are this kind of words that are much the same as burnt iron arrows thrust in between my two ears. [3-45-30, 
31a]

[Commentary] The role of women in bringing alterations in joint families, peaceful histories or even in transcending 
legends is evident in every culture. mahaanto api hi bhidyante striibhiH adbhiH iva acalaaH | kaamandaka 
- lavaNa jalaantaa nadyaH strii bhedaantaani bandhu hR^idayaani | praaciina smR^iti - dk - 'They, 
the women, may be great beings but they tear asunder hearts, like oceans tearing great mountains.' Lakshmana 
is not eye-to-eye with Seetha and he is going on listening all her accusations with his two ears. And 
in between his two ears his conscience is there which is not permitting him to tolerate these words, 
yet he is tolerating.

Shlok 31b- 32a: "Let all of the forest-itinerants indeed listen as to how you are addressing me with bitter words, though 
I am reasoning with you conscientiously, and let them become my corroborators for the sake of justice. 
[3-45-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: "Fie upon you, you are acrimoniously tempered owing to your faminality, and by which impulsive reason 
you mistrust me who am presently abiding in my brother's order, may God damn you for that crotchety. 
[3-45-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: "I am going there where Rama is, oh, lady with best visage, you be blest, and oh, broad-eyed one, let 
all of the forest deities protect you. [3-45-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b: "Gauging by those dangerous forebodings that are now bidding fair, can I to see you again along with 
Rama on my return, or not? That I do not know." Thus Lakshmana spoke to Seetha. [3-45-34b, c]

[Commentary] Lakshmana is repeatedly addressing Seetha as 'a broad-eyed-lady,' suggesting that 'though you have broad-eyes, 
but your mental perception is not that broad' 'as your eyes are belying your faculties.' 'And as 'the 
daughter of Janaka,' that is the 'daughter of a judicious person, yet unable to discriminate.' And as 
Vaidehi that is, one 'coming from Videha province.' Videha also means 'without body.' You are some supernatural, 
yet that demon beguiled you,' so on.

[Commentary] Lakshmana said Seetha 'be lost in desolation...' in the first instance and further said that she 'be 
blest...' and seeks the help of pastoral divinities to protect Seetha in his absence. This appears self-contradictory 
on the part of Lakshmana. But it is held correct, for he uttered derogatory words in the first instance 
as a vexed person and then, on knowing what that is suddenly uttered by him, he is correcting himself 
in saying that 'she be blest...' He wished her to prosper as she belongs to Rama. Whatever belongs to 
Rama that cannot be ridiculed, especially his mother-like elder sister-in-law.

Shlok 35: When Lakshmana spoke to that wailful daughter of Janaka, she on her part spoke this curt sentence to 
him, while tears whelmed her to a fault. [3-45-35]

Shlok 36: "Without Rama I plunge myself in River Godavari, or else I string up myself, or discard this body of 
mine from heights..." Thus Seetha started to vent out her feelings. [3-45-36]

Shlok 37: "I drink deadly poison, or I enter a flaring fire, but I will never touch another man other than Raghava. 
[3-45-37]

[Commentary] With regard to touching another man, some texts say the word kadaapi 'never' and some padaa 
api 'by foot, even.' 'I do not touch any other man even with my foot.' This signifies 'marriage.' 
In marriages there is a custom for the newly weds, like handshake and pressing toes of one another, 
in order to acclimatise one with the other's body touch. Here, if this paadaa api is taken 
as that custom in marriages. Thus she says that 'in the process of marriages such foot-pressing of bride 
and bridegroom occurs, hence I do not wish to undergo such situations.' As such, this is not mere touching 
someone with her foot.

[Commentary] These intimidations of Seetha that she will commit suicide by consuming poison, hanging, plunging in 
river, self-immolation etc., are not new to Seetha or to any woman, under these irksome situations. 
She is giving many alternatives for suicide and the last one is self-immolation. If she is not going 
to die by hanging herself, or by consuming poison, or by drowning in river, then the question of self-immolation 
comes up. But she lists all of them in her anguish for Rama. With the same impetuosity she jumps into 
fire in the episode of agni praveshanam after war, when Rama belittles her. There also, she 
orders the very same Lakshmana to arrange pyre for her, disregarding her own accusations made at Lakshmana, 
at this situation.

Shlok 38: Seetha on declaring to Lakshmana in this way, she who is anguished and weeping bitterly, then started 
to smite her belly with both of her palms in a heightened agony. [3-45-38]

Shlok 39: Observing the agonised aspect of Seetha that cheerless Saumitri started to cheer her up by repeatedly 
informing that her husband Rama will come soon. Even then Seetha has not spoken in the least to the 
brother of her husband, and maintained a silence of antipathy. [3-45-39]

Shlok 40: But then, holding Seetha in usual reverence that self-respectful Lakshmana briefly came to her fore 
making a reverential palm-fold that briefly, and then he proceeded to the proximity of Rama, while repeatedly 
looking back at that lonely lady in the thick of forest. [3-45-40]

[Commentary] Till now Lakshmana is at her behind or at her sideways, as he usually stands a foot behind Rama or Seetha, 
and now came to her fore to revere her vis-Ã -vis and made a semi-salute, i.e., briefly and 
briskly adjoined and disjoined his palms, without bringing the joined palms up to his heart or his face. 
Bringing the folded palms up to one's own heart is suggestive of 'pouring forth one's own heart' at 
the other, which is known in prayers as iungo manus ante pectus and if it is lifted up to forehead, 
it is suggestive of 'concentrating with whole of the mind,' and if hands are totally lifted into air 
it is for the god unknown. But here this iungere manus is neither ante pectus, infra pectus,
nor supra abdomen but a quick gesture. He is performing an iSTa namaskaara 'un, 
interested, greeting...' 'a half-hearted gesture' like a 'cold-handshake' rather than a 'warm' one because 
he is now sent by her compulsively and compulsorily.

[Commentary] Indian woman is no sacred cow. For that matter, no woman is of that kind, unless compulsorily conditioned 
to be like that. A woman can be said as cow-faced-tigress, as: go mukha vyaaghra, [not in dissent.] 
She prowls, growls and howls at others if her interests are contradicted. Thus, Seetha's is not only 
a sacred cow but also a shrewd lioness-princess, and her rash talking is not new or instantaneous at 
this place alone. She said something against Kaikeyi with Sumantra, which, Sumantra does not report 
to Kausalya in Ayodhya Kanda, chapter 60, and verse 14. One full chapter, Aranya Kanda of 9th is catered 
to Seetha's haranguing Rama, when Rama wanted to wage an unprovoked war. She does not spare even her 
own husband, if the contemplated deed is contrary to her thinking, and because she is countering her 
own husband she includes a saving clause, 'I have spoken in all my womanliness... it is up to you to 
decide....' otherwise it will be a straight tongue-lashing. Thus talking riff-raff with Lakshmana is 
no great surprise.

[Commentary] Further, she is angering through perplexity caused by the hearing a help cry similar in tone with her 
husband's voice: bhartR^i aarta svara sadR^isham aakrandanam aakraNya vidiirNa hR^idayaa hR^idaya 
dayitu premNaa kartavyam ajaananaa jaanakii - - - sam utpanna kopayaa siitayaa - bhaaShitam - dk 
Seetha said mama hetoH praticchannaH 'for me you are covertly behaving...' and Lakshmana, who 
is famous for his rashness also said to Seetha tiikShNaa bhedakaraaH striyaH 'women are the 
severe wreckers...' of households, kingdoms etc., remembering Sage Agastya's saying in Aranya, Ch. 13 
verse 6: 'With the dangling of hundreds of streaks of thunderbolt and also a weapon's incisiveness, 
and also with the speediness of an eagle and wind's gust, the women are conformable...'

[Commentary] Besides, Seetha vowed to offer many oblations to Ganga, when crossing that river to enter the deep of 
forests in Ayodhya II, Ch. 52, verses 87-90: suraa ghaTa sahasreNa maamsa bhuuta odanena ca yakShyaami 
aham 'I will offer thousand pots of liquor, meaty food, if, my husband and I return safely...' 
Even though Shiromani Vyaakhya says that these are not liquor pots or it is not the meat food, yet they 
are some offerings to be made by Seetha to Ganga, if they return. She uses many 'if' clauses while praying 
thus, for the safety of her husband. What will become of them, if Rama's life itself is at stake?

[Commentary] Here, both Seetha and Lakshmana, are accusing each other. It is not reiterated elsewhere in Ramayana, 
and hence some say that this episode is an interpolation. 'Can these two go on narrating this scandalous 
dialogue to somebody, detailing how each accused the other...' is the ensuing question. This episode 
has happened in between these two and it does not merit a discussion with somebody else, because such 
a discussion will attract many cha, cha-s, and chi, chi--s for Seetha, hence this 
is neither an interpolation nor a repeatable episode.

[Commentary] Then the commentator concludes in saying that each of them is right in his/her way and in emotion, situation 
and portent. siitaa vacanasya bharti aarta shabda shravaNa samjaata kheda vashena aapadi raamo avashyam

janita kopa vashena pravR^ittam | agastya vacanam tu svataH saralaa siitaa iti abhipraayakam iti na 
virodhaH - - dk

[Commentary] Later, Seetha repents for her rash talk with Lakshmana in yuddha kaaNDa, Ch. 113, verses 40, 45-46, 
saying:

[Commentary] 'When my fate is against me, and when my earlier sins [of finding fault with Lakshmana,] have acquired 
this [incarceration in Lanka...] one has to reap the results of one's own faults... a sinner, or a do-gooder, 
or one undergoing a capital punishment shall be treated kindly... who is he/she that does not offend...'

[Commentary] These are the very same words of Sugreeva in Kishkindha, Ch. 36, verse 11: "Either in faith or in friendliness 
if I have overstepped, in the least, that may be pardoned for I am an attendant of yours... for, none 
is unoffending...' All this culminates into the saying 'to err is human...'

[Commentary] On the other hand, in the perspective of mythology, the time has come for Seetha to go to Lanka, in 
order to effectuate her curse to Ravana as Vedavati, where Vedavati cursed Ravana, 'I will be the root 
cause for your total elimination... as Seetha...' For such a transit, Rama shall go away from her, for 
that she wanted that golden deer and as a good husband Rama ran after it. But this security guard is 
an obstinate obstacle than Rama and he will not go away from here, because he has to keep custody of 
his brother's entrustment. Unless such unbearable words are spoken to a self-respectful person like 
Lakshmana, he doe not stir out. To stop his leeching onto her, she had to talk in an abnormal way, which 
made him to go away, though reluctantly, and which paved the way for Ravana's entry. If the Golden Deer 
is not there, Rama will not go, if Rama's voice is not heard Lakshmana cannot be sent, and if Lakshmana 
does not go, Ravana will not come... then a blemish called anavasthaa doSha -- ad infintum...occurs 
to Ramayana. If we do not mind to end Ramayana in that way, Ravana will be ruling high, even today...



SARGA 46
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana praises Seetha's beauty by extolling every limb of hers, though he enters like a Brahman sanyaasi, 
a friar. He indulges in a most untoward laudation that is unbefitting for a saintly and elderly almsman. 
Unable to refute him, because he is in such a pious garb, she had to invite him as an untimely guest.

Shlok 1: Raghava's younger brother Lakshmana is very much infuriated at Seetha who spoke to him rudely, as such 
he journeyed towards Rama at once as though he is yearning to see Rama immediately, albeit his heart 
wanted him to stand guard to Seetha. [3-46-1]

Shlok 2: Quickly taking hold of intervallic time then the ten-headed Ravana approached Vaidehi adopting an aspect 
of a sanyaasi, a meandering Brahman friar. [3-46-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: That sanyaasi is now cloaked in smooth silky saffron, his head-hair is neatly tufted, sandals are wooden, 
umbrella is on right shoulder, and on his left shoulder a shaft of sanyaasi is shouldered, onto which 
his handy water vessel is hooked, and he proceeded towards Vaidehi in a mien of meandering sanyaasi. 
[3-46-3, 4a]

[Commentary] There are many dress rules to a sanyasi 'the Hindu sanyaasi' where the main items are, as said by Sage 
Angiirasa: brahma suutram 
tridanDam ca vastram jantu nivaaraNam | shikyam paatram bR^isiim caiva kaupiinam kaTi veShTitam 
'sacred thread, three-shafts, saffron clothing, deerskin, handy water vessel, grass-mat, loin-cloth, 
girdle-cloth... by these he will be known as a real sanyasi 'Hindu sanyaasi.' Out of all these items, 
the shafts make a difference. Vaishnavaite sanyaasi-s handle three shafts tied into one, and the three 
are symbolic to cit, acit, iishvara 'animate, inanimate, and lord...' and on this Manu says
vaak daNDaH 
ca mano daNDaH kaaya daNDaH tathaiva ca | yasya ete nihitaa buddhau sa tridaNDii ca ucya te 
the word daNDa means 'repressing, suppression, control...' thus a sanyaasi has to control his 'speech, 
mind, and body... by that alone he is renowned as sanyasi... Manu. As such, Ravana is in the getup of 
an unmistakable Brahman sanyaasi, with an unbridled tongue.

Shlok 4b- 5a: As with a pitchiest gloom overcoming the sunless and moonless lively eventide, that great-mighty Ravana 
came over to Vaidehi in that forest, when she is without two of the brothers, namely Rama and Lakshmana. 
[3-46-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: As a sinister planet looks over Star Rohini when she is devoid of Moon, that extremely sinister Ravana 
then looked over the glorious and youthful princess Seetha. [3-46-5b, 6a]

[Commentary] Rohini is the principle star and dear wife of the Moon will be in lunar asterism of the same name, and 
when she comes in the view of planets like Saturn and Mars astrology predicts earthly havocs. Hence, 
Ravana is compared with such a planet and Seetha with Rohini.

Shlok 6b- 7a: On observing ferocious Ravana whose activities are iniquitous, the trees of Janasthaana are not in full 
sway, nor the wind is in full swing. [3-46-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On seeing him who is seeing with his bloodshot eyes, River Godavari too is frightened and started to 
rush off quietly, whose onrush will be rapid otherwise. [3-46-7b, 8a]

[Commentary] The reaction of the trees, wind, and river is as said by gods to Brahma in Bala Kanda, at 1-15-10: "Surya, 
the Sun will not verily parch Ravana. Maarutha, the Air will not surge at his sides. On seeing Ravana, 
the lord of the undulating, drifting waves, Ocean... will not pulsate either, and will hide the undulating 
waves, for the waves are his wives, and Ravana may abduct them... like Seetha."

Shlok 8b- 9a: In the meanwhile the Decahedron demon Ravana, who is all the while waiting for some lapse of Rama, neared 
Vaidehi in the getup of a sanyaasi. [3-46-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: That disgraceful Ravana made advances in a graceful mien of Brahman almsman to Vaidehi who is thinking 
over her husband, like the slow moving Saturn making advance to Star Citra which will be ominous. [3-46-9b, 
10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Like a wellspring shrouded by grass, enshrouded in a decent getup of a Brahman friar, in a trice Ravana 
leeringly stood before of Vaidehi, the admirable wife of Rama. [3-46-10b, 11a]

[Commentary] This idiomatic usage of tR^iNa kuupa which draws upon straw, is held high by Dr. Satya Vrat, which is 
repeated often in Ramayana. He says 'Probably Kalidasa too was inspired by this very expression of Valmiki 
when he put it in the mouth of Shakuntala as she was being repudiated by Dushyanta:
ko anyo dharma 
kancuka praveshinaH tR^iNa kuupa upama asya tava anukaari bhaviShyati - abhij~naana shaakuntalam 
Act 5.

Shlok 11b- 12: While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are 
fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and 
sitting in the straw-cottage, and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry 
silks, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. [3-46-11b, 12,13]

Shlok 14: He who is hit by the arrows of Love-god that king of demons Ravana, on seeing Seetha entered resonating 
the resonances of Vedic-hymns as precursory in seeking alms, and spoke these well-mannered sentences 
to her who is in solitariness. [3-46-14]

Shlok 15: Ravana really acclaimed her who is an excellent one in all the three worlds, beaming forth with the 
beauty of her body, and who is like Goddess Lakshmi but for Divine-lotus as Her settle, for Seetha is 
devoid of her settling, namely Rama. [3-46-15]

Shlok 16: "Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded 
with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?" Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha [3-46-16]

[Commentary] The beautiful outfits on this lotus-stalk like Seetha are her mukha kamala, netra kamala, kara kamala, 
paada kamala... 'lotus-eyes, lotus-face, lotus-stalk like hands and lotus-feet and other limbs...' The 
word padmini also means a 'lake' besides the runner of lotus plant. The first compound is also read 
as: raupya kaancana aabhaa meaning 'shining like silver and gold...' but it is in limited mms and with 
very limited use.

Shlok 17: "Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous 
Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a 
self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God. [3-46-17]

[Commentary] These three attributes are as informed by gods to Vishnu about the three wives of Dasharatha at 
1-15-20, as: hrii, HR^illekha, virtue, modesty, uprightness... shrii, shriikaara 
affluence, prosperity and also suggestive of resplendence, radiance of that prosperity or effluence 
and kiirti fame, renown, glory... a bhuuti, vibhuuti is accordance, give-all, 
fortune. The ash applied on forehead in worships is to be applied with a verse bhuutir bhuutikar 
iishvarii... and for each of these attributes, a presiding deity is there with the same name. 
Here the hrii is also taken to mean bhuu devi 'Mother Earth' another wife of 
Vishnu. The addressing varaarohe etc., are the attributes of the addressees as a beautiful 
woman in the group of: varaarohaa, matta kaashinii, uttamaa, vara varNiniii - amara kosha

Shlok 18: "Your teeth are evenly, smooth and their tips are like jasmine buds, and your whitish broad eyes are 
spotless, reddish at ends, and pupils are black. [3-46-18]

Shlok 19- 20: "Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant's trunks, and these two breasts of yours that are 
ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up 
and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they 
are covetable for they are beautiful. [3-46-19, 20]

Shlok 21- 22a: "Oh, allurer, your smile is alluring, teeth are alluring, and your eyes allure, oh, beauty, your waist 
is palmful, your hair velvety, your breasts are jostling, and you rob my soul as a spate robs riverbank. 
[3-46-21, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "I have not hitherto seen any earthly female with this kind of features on the face of earth; or, a 
goddess - no; a gandharva female - no; yaksha female - no; kinnaraa female - no, none whosoever! [3-46-22b, 
23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "I marvel why an excellent one in all the three worlds by her features, more so, fragile and youthful 
as yourself should be living here in the thick of forest. [3-46-23b, 24, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: Such as you are you go back, let safety betide you, as you are unsuited to live in here, for this forest 
is the dwelling for ghastly demons who by their wish will be changing their guise. [3-46-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: "Delightful rooftops of skyscrapers, flourishing and richly fragranced pleasure-gardens of cities alone 
are meetly to you to saunter. [3-46-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Oh, beauteous lady, I opine that only best garlands, best scents, best foodstuffs, best clothing are 
meetly to you, oh, lady with black pupils, hence it is meet and right to you to have a best husband.



"Getting at you, the garlands, scents, foodstuffs, or clothing, they all become the best, because you 
are the best beauteous one, as such, he alone becomes a best person who gets you as his wife, and it 
is meet and right to you to choose such a husband, [aside: me alone.] [3-46-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: "Oh, curvaceous lady, who are you? Oh, one with an impeccable smile, do you belong to Rudraa-gods, or 
Marut-gods, or to Vasu-s? To me you are beaming forth like a goddess. [3-46-27b, 28a]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'your kind of female is unspotted by me among humans, so you must be some goddess, but I 
have marked all gods and there I did not find you. This province belongs to demons. As such, gods, 
gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s and others cannot enter this place, let alone the gods from Shiva's side, 
because Shiva is the Ultimate for demons. If so, do you belong to ekaa dasha rudraa-s 
eleven Rudraa-s? Or, because Air can circulate here, do you belong to any of the forty-nine 
marut gaNaa-s, Wind-gods? Or, because earth has ancient connections with aSTa vasu-s, 
eight-Vasu-s, do you belong to any one of them?' Further, Seetha is not smiling throughout this 
chapter as her mind is set on her husband's safety. Nevertheless Ravana assumes that if Seetha 
smiles, that smile will be impeccable.

Shlok 28b- 29a: "This is the dwelling-place of demons, and no goddess, nor a gandharva, nor a kinnara can arrive here, 
but how you have come here? [3-46-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: "Here, simians, lions, leopards, tigers, likewise other predators, bears, tigers, vultures will be moving. 
How you are not frightened from them? [3-46-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: "Being alone in this forest, oh, lady with a lovely face, how you are unafraid of horrendous and mighty 
elephants possessed of rut? [3-46-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31- 32b: "Oh, auspicious lady, who are you? Whose are you? Also from where are you? And being lonely, what for 
you are moving in dreadful Dandaka forest that is adored by demons?" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-46-31, 
32b]

Shlok 32b- 33: When the wicked minded Ravana praised her in this way, Vaidehi the princess from Mithila has seen him 
who has arrived in the getup of Brahman and started to revere him with all the respects affordable to 
a casual guest. [3-46-32b, 33]

Shlok 34: She firstly fetched a seat him, then invited him with water for feet-wash, and then said to him who 
looked gracious in his bearing, 'alms are ready.' [3-46-34]

Shlok 35: Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and finding no reason to refute him flatly, as he has come like a Brahman, she invited him as a Brahman.



Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and as he came with an unimperilling appearance of a Brahman, she invited him as she would 
ordinarily invite a real Brahman. [3-46-35]

[Commentary] Did she recognise Ravana as a pseudo-Brahman or not... is the doubt raised by this verse, because 
different texts use different compounds apaaya a darshanam.... upaaya a darshanam etc. It 
is concluded that she, for sure, identified him as a pseudo-Brahman, because she has seen many such
sanyasi-s while she was in Mithila. Hence she is said here as Maithili because she 
hails from Mithila and her father's court was full with these sanyasi-s, yati-s, parivraajaka-s.
Then it is questioned as to why she invited him, though recognised him as a pseudo-Brahman. For 
this Govindaraja says: kaaSaaya daNDa maatreNa yatiH 
puujyo na samshayaH | 'By spotting the saffron robe alone, a sanyasi is venerable...'

[Commentary] Then, another doubt is raised as to how she noticed him to be pseudo- sanyasi . For this it 
is said  raatri advaanam yaanam ca 

strii kathaa laulyam eva ca | mancakam shukla vastram yatiinaam patanaani SaT || 'Meandering during night, using vehicles, showing interest in episodes relating to women, and 
relations with women, using a cot to sleep, wearing white cloths... these six show the downfall of 
his sanyaasi-hood...' Ravana is indulged in strii kathaa in the whole of this chapter, in 
admiring at her lips, breasts, thighs etc., and no usual swasti vacana, shubha aashiis 
'blessings...' are uttered by him and thus Seetha could discern him to be a pseudo- sanyasi.

[Commentary] Though knowing him as such, why should she revere him at all, is another question. What else she 
could do as his appearance itself is uddveSTum a+shakyam 'irrefutable appearance of a 
Brahman sanyasi...' hence, somehow some time is to be gained until the arrival of Rama or 
Lakshmana. Otherwise, this pseudo-sanyasi may cause any pseudo-problem that she cannot 
solve. For this, the reply is at the word in the last verse haritam dadarsha... 'only 
greenery is seen by her not Rama nor Lakshmana...' And in the next verse itself she is addressing 
him as a "Brahman...' but not with the titles like sanyasi or yatiishvara, paramahamsa, 
parivraajaka etc. A Brahman alone is eligible to take up sanyaasa 
'Hindu-sanyaasi-hood...' not Kshatriya or others. Hence, she concluded him to be Brahman. When once 
the sanyaasi-hood is taken he is no more a Brahman and his bodily being neutralises in the Absolute, 
and such a sanyaasi shall drag on his body, without comfortable bodily needs, until his natural 
death. But Seetha is addressing him contrary to his stance.

Shlok 36: "Oh, Brahman, this is the Darbha-grass-seat and you be seated comfortably, here is water, receive it 
for hand and feet wash, here is the forest grown victuals for your sake... dine on them relaxedly..." 
Thus Seetha said to Ravana. [3-46-36]

Shlok 37: Ravana thoroughly observed that wife of the king, Maithili, when she invited him talking civilities 
contextual in inviting a guest, that too Brahman sanyasi, and he firmed up his mind to abduct her even 
forcibly, and started to dedicate himself for destruction. [3-46-37]

Shlok 38: Then she looked forward for her shapely husband who has gone on a hunting game, and who must be returning 
along with Lakshmana, and though she looked intently she could only see the green backdrop of that great 
forest, but not Rama or Lakshmana. [3-46-38]



SARGA 47
------------------------------

[Text] The debate of Seetha and Ravana has started, as Ravana wished to woo Seetha. In the first instance Seetha 
believes him to be a Vedic Brahman but insists to know about him. Ravana reveals his identity and asks 
her to become his wife. Thereupon she goes into a frenzied state and brainstorms Ravana in all her curtness.

Shlok 1: When Ravana whose intention is to abduct her has enquired thus, then on the basis of his Brahman friar's 
mien Seetha informed about herself on her own. [3-47-1]

Shlok 2: Thinking briefly that, 'he is a Brahman and an untimely guest, he will indeed curse me if he is not 
replied,' Seetha spoke this sentence. [3-47-2]

[Commentary] A lie cannot be uttered to a sanyaasi, much less to a Brahman. This friar appears as someone who is 
attired as a sanyaasi to fill his stomach. But he is Brahman, because he came booming Vedic hymns, which 
no other lesser Brahman can do. Thus, he is someone with a perfect Vedic background... and according 
to the saying:  yatiinaam puujanam kaaryam striyaa vaa puruSena... ' an ascetic is to 
be revered either by a lady or a gentleman...' and thus he cannot be turned out saying 'my husband is 
not at home...' and if he is neglected he may curse...' these are the criss-cross thoughts of Seetha 
at that moment. Ghastly Viradha boldly carried her off at one time, but she is yet to see the cunningness 
of a demon. So with a half-belief and half-heart she started to talk to him.

Shlok 3: "I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife 
and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. [3-47-3]

[Commentary] Here some versions use bhaaryaa 'wife' while some use mahiSii 'queen...' and this
bhadram te coupled with jihiirSuNaa 'abduction wisher...' is taken as a forewarning 
to Ravana, as she immediately says who her husband is, as she is aware that this friar is Ravana. Then 
it implicitly means 'you who wish to abduct me, think twice, for my husband is Rama, and let safety 
prevail on whole of your dynasty, for it is hard to deal with Rama or with his dear queen-wife...'

Shlok 4: "On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all 
cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. [3-47-4]

[Commentary] Mythically Seetha is Goddess Lakshmi and an accorder of prosperity. Here she is saying that she had 
to enjoy 'humanly indulgences...' because her husband incarnated himself as a man, and since she had 
to enjoy along with him in her in-law's place, she enjoyed those luxuries. Or, if this is read as
a+ maanuSa bhogaan 'superhuman delights...' [of course, not 'inhuman delights...'] she enjoyed 
heavenly comforts as she was enjoying as Lakshmi in vaikunTha 'Milky Ocean of Vishnu.' And 
then, she is indirectly telling Ravana that she has come now as Seetha, after immolating herself as 
Vedavati, in an earlier incarnation, only to end Ravana.

Shlok 5: "In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers 
to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. [3-47-5]

Shlok 6: "When Raghava's anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her 
husband Dasharatha for a boon. [3-47-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought 
two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. [3-47-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9- 10a: " 'If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,' 
thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful 
riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. [3-47-8b, 9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: "My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years 
are reckoned up from my birth. [3-47-10b, 11a]

[Commentary] These foots are said to be nonexistent in some more ancient mms. But lengthy narrations are there in 
calculating the age of Rama and Seetha, at this point of legend with these stanzas. The letter bha
in the line mama bhartaa mahaatejaa is the ninth letter of Gayatri hymn and thus the ninth 
book of Ramayana with thousand couplets is started from here. The whole of Ramayana is with twenty-four 
thousand verses and Gayatri hymn has twenty-four letters, and each book of Ramayana contains a thousand 
verses, starting with each letter of Gayatri. This is the then classification of the cantos of this 
epic and such grouping of verses is nonexistent now.

Shlok 11b: "Rama - thus he is exalted in the world, an unambiguous, unblemished, unsullied one, and a broad-eyed 
ambidextrous one, who delights in bringing universal welfare, is my husband. [3-47-11b, 12a]

[Commentary] The dexterity of an archer depends mainly on his sighting and targeting eye. Hence, the eyes and dexterity 
are to be coupled instead of cleaving them as two attributes of Rama. Otherwise, in Seetha's saying 
that 'my husband is a broad-eyed one...' it does not make any sense to Ravana, because Ravana's eyes 
are much more bigger and bloodshot. Thus 'my ambidextrous husband's eyes are broad puNDariika vishaala 
akshaH, and those eyes are a couple of fish-eye lenses of a camera and can view in 360Âº, thus you 
cannot escape their target, in any angle...' Further, these and some more attributes in the coming verses 
like simha uraska etc., they are the very same words coined by Sage Narada, while informing 
Valmiki about Rama in the first chapter of Bala Kanda. Some think such repetitions are essentially Homeric. 
But in Indian scripts they are not mere repetitions but reiteration of the very same concept in the 
very same words, which is not an epical flaw in view of the ruling aadaraat punarukti, aadaraat 
dvirukti... 'an affectionate reiteration...' Hence, the very same words are put on the tongue of 
the principle character, Seetha.

Shlok 12b- 13a: "But Rama's father Dasharatha was lovesick for Kaikeyi and to fulfil her desired aspiration that great 
king did not anoint Rama. [3-47-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "When Rama arrived in the presence of his father, Kaikeyi readily and decidedly spoke these words to 
my husband. [3-47-b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15b: " 'What your father has proclaimed, oh, Raghava, that may be heard from me. He said, 'let this thornless 
kingdom be accorded to Bharata.' [3-47-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "And you, oh, Kakutstha Rama, indeed have to inhabit the forests for nine plus five years, hence you 
repair to forests and redeem your father from the remorse of perjury.' [3-47-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: " 'As an unfearing one from any quarter and as a resolute one in his pledge my husband Rama said 'so 
be it' to Kaikeyi and followed her dictate. [3-47-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "My husband is evermore a renderer but not a recipient, and forever he speaks truth, and not the untruth, 
least of all. Oh, Brahman, this is the unalterable and unsurpassable vow of Rama. [3-47-17b, 18a]

[Commentary] In Maha Bharata Dharmaraja is informed that 'a king shall give, but he shall not beseech, he can perform 
a Vedic Ritual but cannot make it performed by others, he can learn Veda-s, but cannot teach them, he 
shall endeavour to govern the people [properly...] dadyaat raajaa na yaaceta yajeta na yaajayeta 
| na adhyaapayet adhiyiita prajaan ca paripaalayet || bhaarata - raaja dharma

Shlok 18b- 19a: "One known as Lakshmana is such a Rama's brother from another mother, and he is a valorous one, tigerly-man, 
and an eliminator of enemies in war. [3-47-18b, 19a]

[Commentary] A stepmother is called as vi maata or dvaimaata and it is said vaimaatreyo vimaatR^ija 
- amara kosha one is other mother, the other is second-mother, both are the nomenclatures of a 
stepmother.

Shlok 19b- 20a: "He who is known as Lakshmana, a follower of virtue and steadfast in his commitment, followed Rama handling 
his bow as a helpmate, when Rama was proceeding to forests along with me. [3-47-19b, 20a]

[Commentary] Some texts use the word brahma caarii 'celibate' basing on the word Rama used when saying about 
Lakshmana to Shuurpanakha about Lakshmana as apuurvii while some others use as above.

Shlok 20b- 21a: "Because Rama always abides in probity and resolutely vowed to it, he entered Dandaka forest in the 
aspect of a tufty haired saint along with me and his brother. [3-47-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: "Such as we are, oh, eminent Brahman, we three are moving about the impenetrable Dandaka forest just 
by our own mettle as we fell down from kingdom owing to Kaikeyi. [3-47-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23: "Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will 
be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches 
meat, aplenty. [3-47-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: "Such as you are, oh, Brahman, you may make mention of your name, parentage and caste, in their actuality. 
For what reason you are wandering in Dandaka forest lonesomely?" Thus Seetha questioned Ravana. [3-47-24]

[Commentary] She is addressing him as 'oh, Brahman...' and yet asking his caste. This is a tricky stanza. This implies 
her knowledge and/or ignorance about Ravana. As a housewife, it is a natural question to be put to an 
out-of-way friar moving in the deep of forests. Here, neither a village, nor a single family, nor even 
a human being is available to accord alms, and this odd almsman is moving here who is supposed to move 
about villages as said: bhiksha artham graamam pravishet.. Or, she must be asking him about 
his caste, creed etc., when he was a householder. But it is out of place. On the other hand, if Seetha 
is from a well-trained family, she is not supposed to question the caste, creed, and name of a real 
sanyaasi. Again, she is asking him to reveal himself 'in essence, truthfully.' She might have thought 
him to be a cursing Brahman in the first instance, but she might have found him out to be a pseudo-sanyaasi. 
Now that she is slowly realising that he may not be a proper Brahman either, she may be asking him straightforwardly. 
Because Ravana is coming out of Brahman's guise in next two stanzas, it is said that she pointedly asked 
him as above.

Shlok 25: Ravana, the great-mighty king of demons, brusquely replied Seetha, the wife of Rama, while she is still 
speaking in this way. [3-47-25]

Shlok 26: "Oh, Seetha, of whom all the worlds composed of gods, demons and humans are highly startled, I am that 
sovereign of hosts of demons, known as Ravana. [3-47-26]

Shlok 27: "On seeing you, oh, impeccable one, glittering with golden complexion and attired in ochry-silks, I 
derive no pleasure in my wives. [3-47-27]

[Commentary] Ravana as a devotee of Lakshmi said the above as a renouncer. tvaam dR^iSTvaa 'on seeing you...' 
after a long time... svakeSu 'in my kith and kin...' daareSu wives...' ratim
'pleasure, involvement...' na adhigacChaami 'not, I attain...' 'On seeing you, I no longer 
can attain pleasure with my kith and kin, or with my wives... for I have seen my ultimate motherly goddess... 
thus I am ready to renounce this accursed being of Ravana...' Maheshvara Tirtha.

Shlok 28: "You become my prime queen above all the choicest women with superior status, whom I have appropriated 
from here and there. [3-47-28]

[Commentary] Ravana as devotee is saying: aaR^itaanaam uttamam striiNaam 'To all of the choicest women appropriated 
by me...; mama to me'; agra mahiSiiyaa 'to the one who is my prime queen'; tasyaaH 
ca mama ca to her and to me; bhava iishvarii you be the ruling deity; 'To all of the choicest 
women appropriated by me... and to the one who is my present prime queen, namely Mandodari, to her and 
to me, and to all of us, you be the ruling deity...' Tiirtha.

Shlok 29: "Nestled on a mountaintop my great city known as Lanka is there in the midst of an ocean and all over 
encompassed by an ocean. [3-47-29]

Shlok 30: "Oh, Seetha, there you can saunter in pleasure-gardens along with me, and oh, lady with resentment, 
you will not think back to this forest-living, at all events. [3-47-30]

[Commentary] The word bhaamini is an addressing to a beautiful lady, who is with some anger or resentment
kopanaa saa eva bhaaminii - amara kosha and Ravana mistook Seetha's fury as 'an anger in passion.'

Shlok 31: "Oh, Seetha, if you become my wife five thousand handmaidens adorned with ornaments of every description 
will be in your attendance." Thus Ravana said to Seetha. [3-47-31]

[Commentary] Ravana, the devotee, is saying panca sahasraaNi daasyaH 'five thousand servants...' me 
'with me... together with me' paricariSyasi yadi tava 'if we all render service to you...' 
then you will be baaryaa; bha + aaryaa; bhaayaa= kaantyaa, aaryaa= puujyaa 'by your splendour...'
bhavasi you will become the venerable Goddess Lakshmi by your own splendour while thousands 
are serving you...'

Shlok 32: When Ravana said in this way, Seetha the daughter of Janaka, a flawless one by her physique, dishonoured 
and replied that demon. [3-47-32]

[Commentary] Here the word tu in raavaNena evam uktaa tu is said as tu shabdena puurvokta upacaara 
vacana vilakshaNa vacana it means ultimately as - Seetha spoke in derision.

Shlok 33: "I have avowed to adhere to such a husband Rama, who is inflexible like a sturdy mountain, comparable 
to lordly Indra, unshakable like a vast ocean. [3-47-33]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'A mountain will be unswerving even if a hundred thunderbolts strike it at once, thus is my 
husband... but you, you are always swerving while hankering after your petty cherishes... thus, you 
are a straw in the wind... my husband is a coequal of Indra, while you are humiliated by Indra's son. 
The ocean will be turbulent on its surface but it will be calm and clear at its abyss, engulfing unusual 
treasures... though my husband appears as a passionate person, an indulgent person in humanly pursuits, 
from hunting games to hollering, in worldly agonies and ecstasies, but at his heart, he is like the 
fathomless serene ocean... I have avowed to follow him in this lifetime.'

Shlok 34: "He who is enriched with all endowments, and who is like a banyan tree with its surmounted orbicularity, 
the high-minded one with truthfulness alone is his target, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. 
[3-47-34]

[Commentary] The banyan tree is an Indian fig tree, Ficus benghalensis, the branches of which hang down and root 
themselves. The simile of a banyan tree to Rama says that: he is an atom in the atomic seed of that 
tree. On its growth, it spreads so wide and broad and every branch take its own root like the manifold 
growth of this universe. Hence, every individual being is his offspring and progeny. And the whole universe 
is pervaded by his 'tree-top' like shelter. Secondly, that tree gives shelter to innumerable beings 
for it is so wide at its apex. Hence, anyone can take shelter under Rama, because he is obliged to oblige 
all sarva jana anukuulata as said in an ancient saying: kuupa udakam vaTa cchaayaa yuvatiinaam stana 
dvayam | shiitaa kaale bhavet uShNam uShNa kaale bhavet shiitalam || 'water in a well, banyan tree 
shade, maiden's two breasts, will warm up in cold season and cool down in hot season...' Govindaraja.

Shlok 35: "He who is ambidextrous, broad-chested, supreme among men, and a lion-like person with the strides of 
prancing lion, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-35]

[Commentary] 'His dexterity is evident from the moment he started to save the order of universe, at the time churning 
Milky Ocean, becoming Mohini, becoming a Fish, a Tortoise etc. His strides are evident, when he as a 
dwarfish boy strode all the three worlds. As a lion-man, he tore the very stomach of the evil and now 
he is striding like a prancing lion towards you, for you alone are the prey for that lionised human 
incarnation...'

Shlok 36: "He who is a valiant one with a face like that of full-moon, a prince with his self-conquered, and he 
who is expressly acclaimed and effectively armed, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-36]

[Commentary] 'He is a valiant person and he confronts, if need be, his enemies straightforwardly, about which you 
have heard when your Khara, Dushana, and others are eliminated by him... but you are sneaky and slithery... 
you are ever a thief, never a valiant one... his face is like a pleasant full-moon, at any given opportunity, 
while yours is revulsive... and you are like the eclipsing planet Rahu or Ketu, whose effect lasts a 
few minutes... he is expressly acclaimed for his welfare activities and of course, you are also expressly 
acclaimed, but, only for your ill-faring actives... the senses of an yet to be crowned prince will be 
like the unbridled horses... but my husband conquered his own senses like an uncrowned sagacious emperor... 
while you, though you declare yourself as the monarch of demons, there is not even an iota of self-righteousness 
in you, befitting even to a petty king... then where is the question of your majesty, monarchy, or sovereignty...'

[Commentary] Seetha reiterates the statement 'I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama...' four times. This 
is daarDhyata - said for the purpose of 'reinforcement' of her statement.

Shlok 37: "You being a fox you woo me who am an absolutely inaccessible lioness? Why wooing, it is impossible 
for you to touch me as with the untouchable Shine of the Sun. [3-47-37]

[Commentary] A fox usually waits in a ditch until the lion or lioness finishes its feast. The lion will have its 
lion's share and go away. Then the lioness and her cubs have their share and go away. Then it is the 
day of the fox-in-the-ditch. 'Like a fox-in-the-ditch, how you dare to come to an inaccessible lioness, 
when the lion departed...' Next, Sun's wife is Prabha or Shine and she is non-figural resplendent entity. 
She is perceivable but untouchable. If anyone can lay his hands on her by the dint of his yogic or ascetic 
practises, and if he baskets that Shine for use in night, that night becomes a day, for it will be shining 
with sunshine, and thus his pleasurable night is evanished. Thereby he looses his minimal personal comfort 
of a night and it will be self-ruinous to experiment with such ideas.

Shlok 38: "You who are an ill-fated demon, oh, demon, by your wooing the dear wife of Raghava, thus you must be 
visualising many golden trees, undeniably. [3-47-38]

[Commentary] A dying person fantasises golden trees and the like presuming his travel to heaven. By these illusions 
his death is predictable.

Shlok 39: "Do you wish to twitch fangs from the mouth of a ravenous lion, the expeditious challenger of animals, 
and from the mouth of a rebounding venomous serpent. [3-47-39]

[Commentary] The simile of lion and serpent is to Rama and the fangs to Seetha. A lion or a snake knows well how 
to protect its instruments, namely fangs. Hence, Seetha is the fang of expeditious and ravenous Rama 
in eliminating evil on earth and now he will become a grudging venomous cobra too, for its tail is going 
to be trampled, by Seetha's abduction. Thus, the instrumentality of Seetha is established and no instrument 
needs to bother on its own, because its owner takes care of that instrument.

Shlok 40: "Do you wish to steal away the massive Mandara Mountain by the sleight of your hand, but how do you 
wish to decamp healthily without consuming lethal poison? [3-47-40]

[Commentary] She is reminiscing her emergence. Mt. Mandara is mentioned but not Mt. Himalayas or Mt. Meru, even 
though they are more massive and lofty. Vishnu used Mt. Mandara as a churn-staff when Milk Ocean was 
churned, but not Himalayas or Meru and the burden of that Mt. Mandara was sustained by Vishnu alone 
as a Tortoise, which is impossible for simpletons like Ravana, as Ravana failed to lift Mt. Kailash. 
Before Lakshmi's emergence from the churning Milk Ocean, Her elder sister haalaahala 
'lethal poison' emerged and it could be contained only by Shiva, and now, if Ravana contemplates to 
consume her elder sister kaalakuuTa, haalaahala 'lethal poison' it is evident what will 
become of him. This is nidarshana alankaara; samaanya vaakyaartha aikyata 'aesthetics of 
correspondence...'

Shlok 41: "If you wish to override the dear wife of Raghava, then it is as good as wishing to deeply scrape your 
eyes with needlepoint, and licking the razorblade with your tongue. [3-47-41]

Shlok 42- 43a: "You who wish to bitterly intimidate the dear wife of Rama are as good as the one who wish to swim an 
ocean arraying a boulder around his neck, and with a pair of hands you wish to steal away both the Sun 
and Moon? [3-47-42, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: "You who wish to abduct me with an auspicious legend as the wife of Rama, thus you wish to steal away 
a glowing fire in a cloth-bundle, though evincing it to be highly flaming? [3-47-43b, 44a]

Shlok 44b: "You who wish to override the befitting and selfsame wife of Rama, are wishing to tread on the needle-sharp 
spikes of iron spears. [3-47-44b, c]

[Commentary] This declaration that she is selfsame to Rama is on the analogy of raamaa the feminal name of Rama.
aham naaraayanii 
naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa - lakShmii tantra 3-1 - yahaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam svaruupeNa svabhaavataH 
| tayaa vaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii ca tathaa iishvarii || 'I am indeed Naaraayanee 
[i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Lord Vishnu----Lakshmi Tantra 3.1. 'In my essence and entity I 
pervade all this universe, and as I pervade all over I am the controller and presiding deity...'

Shlok 45: "Which odds are there between a lion and a fox in a given forest, which odds are there between a turbid-rivulet 
and an ocean, and which odds are there between a fine-wine and sour-gruel, likewise you are also at 
odds with the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-45]

[Commentary] The usage of the word syandanika is said to be the usage of a rare word by
Valmiki, meaning kshudra nadi 'a turbid-rivulet...' as recorded by Pt. Satya Vrat, in
Ramayana - A Linguistic Study.

Shlok 46: "Which imparity is there among the metals of gold and lead, which imparity is there among the waters 
of sandalwood and sewage, which imparity is there between an elephant and a wildcat of forests, such 
an imparity exists between you and the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-46]

Shlok 47: "Which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a crow and an eagle, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a waterfowl 
and a peacock, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a swan and a falcon living in forest, such a dissimilarity 
obtains betwixt you and the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-47]

Shlok 48: "Even if you steal me away now, later when Indra similar Rama posits himself with his bow and arrows 
in hand on the battlefield, you cannot live on, and in the meanwhile you cannot digest me, as with a 
diamond swallowed along with a fly." Thus Seetha gave her vent to her disdainful feelings towards Ravana. 
[3-47-48]

[Commentary] Here, if a fly is accidentally swallowed along with pure ghee, it will be
vomited out for the nausea caused by that fly in the stomach. But diamond rends the stomach. The
word vajram is usually a diamond, and if a diamond is consumed, accidentally or wilfully,
it will tear off the intestines to death. Hence taking the Vedic saying vajro va aajyam
the word is generally translated as ghee.

Shlok 49: On speaking these sentences with high-strung words, with all her unsullied intentions to that highly 
sullied night-rambler Ravana, her fragile body trembled tormentedly as with a banana plant up-heaved 
by gust. [3-47-49]

[Commentary] She poured forth all of her feelings unbothered for consequences and when her haranguing is over, she 
felt certain uneasiness. This uneasiness is two fold. One is in accordance with humanly nature of a 
woman as she is staunch enough to not yield to any, and if anyone makes an untoward advance, she has 
a 'list' of suicide-programs, those that are narrated to Lakshmana in the previous chapter. Further, 
she is yet to know about Rama's welfare, which will be impossible if this demon carries her away now. 
On the other side, as a Divine Consort of Vishnu, her uneasiness is for her separation from Rama, but 
not from the fear of any molestation by Ravana, and as the expected hour has come, the expectancy for 
the prospective elimination of Ravana is making her to tremble, impetuously.

Shlok 50: On closely marking Seetha to be tremulous, he that Ravana whose impetus is Death similar, clearly informed 
her of his name, caste, competency, and capability as his purpose is to cause scare. [3-47-50]



SARGA 48
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana vaingloriously extols himself and tempts Seetha with all impossible comforts and luxuries, if 
she obliges him and comes to Lanka with him, leaving Rama. She curtly dismisses all his baiting and 
luring.

Shlok 1: When Seetha spoke thus Ravana is embittered, and knitting his eyebrows he indeed spoke these rudish 
words to Seetha. [3-48-1]

Shlok 2: "I am known as Ravana, oh, lady with superb complexion, let safety betide you, the highly valorous and 
ten-headed stepbrother of Kubera. [3-48-2]

Shlok 3: "I am that Ravana at whose sight all the gods together with gandharva-s, evil-spirits, birds and snakes 
will always be frightened and fleeing, as with the people frightened and fleeing from death. [3-48-3]

Shlok 4: "I am that Ravana who when infuriated for some other reason took up a duel with Kubera, his brother 
from stepparent, wherein that Kubera is set up against and completely trounced in a combat. [3-48-4]

Shlok 5: "I am that Ravana by whom Kubera, the god for Wealth-Management whose vehicular transport is handled 
by humans, is tormented fearfully and made to completely abandon his wealthiest place which is presided 
over by him till then, and I am the one who made that Kubera to flee to the excellent Mt. Kailash where 
he is somehow living, because I will not cause any harm on Mt. Kailash as I hold it sacred. [3-48-5]

Shlok 6: "I am that Ravana, oh, auspicious lady, who just by his valour acquired Kubera's auspicious aircraft 
known as Pushpaka, whose pilotage is just by the wish of its aviator, with which I will be travelling 
in skies. [3-48-6]

Shlok 7: "Just by seeing rancour-shot face of mine, oh, Maithili, all the gods will quickly shoot off, even if 
Indra is leading them, then where is the question of their confronting me. [3-48-7]

Shlok 8: "Where I will be staying there the Air-god wafts doubtfully, lest his gusts and blasts may hurt me, 
and the Sun also effectuates his singeing sunbeams as cooling moonbeams, lest I may abduct his wife 
Prabha, the Sunshine. [3-48-8]

Shlok 9: "At places where I will be staying or freely moving there the leaves of trees will be less of rustle, 
lest I may wilt them up, and there the gush of water of rivers too will quieten, lest I may dry them 
up. [3-48-9]

Shlok 10: "My magnificent city known as Lanka is there on the other shore of the ocean, plethoric with all kinds 
of amenities, as well as with ghastly demons, which city will be on par with Indra's Amaravati, but 
for meekly gods and meaningless souls. [3-48-10]

Shlok 11: "That gorgeous city is completely walled in with compound walls that are adorned with whitish silver, 
and its palace-chambers are golden, and its archways are fully jewelled with lapis jewels. [3-48-11]

Shlok 12: "It is encumbered with elephants, horses and chariots, well sounded by the sounds of trumpets, and with 
trees which yield fruits that fulfil all the savours, and it is bedecked with chirrupy pleasure-gardens. 
[3-48-12]

Shlok 13: "Oh, princess, oh, self-respectful lady, if you reside there together with me, hÃ¨, Seetha, then you 
will not think of yourself as one from among human females. [3-48-13]

[Commentary] The addressing expression hè, has some significance, as in hè, raam... hè, prabho... hè, 
bhagavaan... This has a signal of reverence than that the usual 'O' or 'oh,' for they are bland 
expressions of addressing.

Shlok 14: "Revelling in humanly luxuries, over and beyond in heavenly luxuries also, you will not recollect humanly 
Rama, whose longevity is lessened. [3-48-14]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'you said that you enjoyed all humanly luxuries when you stayed at your in-law's place in 
Ayodhya, as at 3-47-4... they are nothing when compared with the luxuries I provide in Lanka... they 
are a + maanuSaan bhogaan 'super human luxuries...' as well as divyaan 
'paradisiacal...' so you choose yourself between this forlorn state and a stately living...' Ravana 
spoke this as a perfect tempting debauch.

[Commentary] Ravana as devotee of Lakshmi is saying: 'If you come to Lanka with me and tatra vasatii 
'while staying there...' another text for the above tatra vasa 'you stay there...' 
mayaa ' by me, a servant of yours, suchlike me...' ellipt. samarpitaan 'submitted, 
offered offerings...' maanuSaan ca divyaam ca bhogaan bhunjaanaa 'humanly, and heavenly 
luxuries, on enjoying...' maanuSiiNaam naariiNaam: dvitiiyena SaSTi 'one among human 
females...' na smariSyasi 'you do not reminisce...'

[Commentary] 'You will not count yourself as a human female, if you come over to Lanka and enjoy the humanly and 
heavenly luxuries, which I, as a humble servant of yours, will offer...'

[Commentary] If you come there, you will not think of maanuSasya 'incarnate as man, Rama...' gata 
aayuSasya = gata, aayuSaH = acquired, longevity; 'Rama who acquired a longevity for eleven 
thousand years... raamasya 'about such a Rama... you will not think about him at all...' 
ellipt. naH sambandhinaH 'we, the related beings of Rama...' smariSyasi 'you think 
of...'

[Commentary] 'you will stop thinking about humans and other humanly affairs, and you also will not think of Rama 
alone, but you will think about us, the accursed demons, the dependents and servants of the Supreme 
Person, Vishnu... and in doing so, your thinking shall lead towards our release from this accursed 
demon-hood...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 15: "Though Rama is the eldest son, king Dasharatha established his dear son Bharata as king, and because 
Rama is spineless he is put to flight to forests, and now, what is he and what am I, in matter of sovereignty. 
[3-48-15]

[Commentary] Ravana as devotee says: raaj~naa 'one that rules from within...' like an antaryaami,
'an inner force... i.e., you as Goddess Lakshmi, raaj~naa 'by King Dasharatha...' as 
an inner force of Dasharatha, you made Dasharatha to select manda viiryaH, a priyaH, putram, 
bharatam 'spineless, not, the choicest, son, Bharata...' and sthaapayitvaa 'you made 
Dasharatha to establish Bharata on throne...' raaj~naa 'by the inner ruler, inner force... 
by you...' the King Dasharatha is incited to send his jyeSTaH 'eldest son...' also as said 
in vishNu sahasra naamaavali: jyeSTaH shreSTaH prajaapatiH 'eldest, best, ruler of 
people... Vishnu, is prasthaapito vanam 'sent away to forests...

[Commentary] âyou are Goddess Lakshmi, an inner-ruler in all beings... though Dasharatha was uninterested to 
select Bharata you made Dasharatha, as his inner force, to select a spineless Bharata, and Bharata 
is established on the throne by Dasharatha, through you... besides, though Dasharatha was 
disinterested to send his dear eldest son Rama to forests, you as Dasharathaâs inner force, made 
Dasharatha to send Rama, the eldest, best, and the only ruler of people, namely Rama, [as said in 
Vishnuâs Thousand names,] to forests for the elimination of demons, and thereby to release us from 
our accursed being... hence you, as inner force of everybody, have to come with me, if Ramaâs 
incarnation is to yield its results...â Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 16: "Rama is subverted from kingdom, thus dwindled is valour, thus winded down is his anima, thus he has 
become a pitiable one, thus he became an ascetic as nothing else is there for him to undertake, oh, 
broad-eyed lady, what do you aspire to do with such a Rama? [3-48-16]

[Commentary] When a tempter can convincingly prove that a woman's husband is 'unfit' then only he can succeed in 
his overtures. His theorematic reasoning is to let down Rama from Seetha's viewpoint, as she has 
broad-eyes, and she is supposed to see reality: 'Rama is rendered to nothing as said in an age-old 
saying bhagnaa kR^iSe bhaagavataa bhavanti 'when manly pursuits fail, he turns out as a 
sanctimonious person... sanyaasi, bairaag, a friar...' Hence, living with him here will 
cause only eye-soar in looking at these murky forests, to your wide-eyes... thus, come with me...'

[Commentary] Ravana as devotee says: bhaSTa raajyena; bhraSTam ariiNaam raajyam, yena tena 'subverted, 
enemies', kingdoms, by whom, by him...' 'he who has subverted all the kingdoms of enemies, with such 
a Rama...' gata cetasaa 'devoid of inner soul...' He by himself is the Cosmic Soul and no 
duality of souls occurs in the Absolute Soul. Because He has no duality, there will be no duality in 
his acts na tasya kaaryam, kaaraNam na vidyate... shruti. Then He is taapasena 
tapasvinaam: taapasa ina tapasvinaam 'for ascetics, lord, also an acetic...' because He is lord 
of all ascetics he must also be one with them...' saha raameNa tvam 'with, Rama, you...' 
ellipt. ayam vij~naapanam 'this supplication...' kariSyasi kim 'will you make 
over, isn't it?

[Commentary] 'He who has snubbed down all enemy kingdoms, where enemies are not earthly enemies, and as he has no 
duality in his deeds, won't you make over this request of mine, in welcoming you to Lanka, to 
him...' Tiirtha.

Shlok 17: "I, the king of all the demons, am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you in love, and instead 
of beseeching me to love you, your rejection and speaking this way, is unapt of you.



"Although I am the king of all the demons, on seeing you I am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came 
to you, thus you love me... but rejecting me this way is unapt of you, as you alone will be loosing 
heavenly comforts, if you reject me. [3-48-17]

[Commentary] Ravana, the devotee is saying: 'I maybe the king of all the demons, but kaamaat 'longingly, 
devotedly, zealously...' iha aagatam 'to here, he who came...' manmadha shara aaviSTam 
prati here the last word prati 'towards' is to be taken as iva 'like, as 
though, deem...' then 'deeming me as though I am hit by the arrows of Love-god and talking 
nonsense...' svayam 'you personally... in your right mind' aakhyaatum na arhasi 
'to say so, is inapt of you...'

[Commentary] "I may be a king of all the demons in universes, but I am a zealotry devotee of yours... but deeming 
me to be one who is hit by the arrows of Love-god and thus speaking nonsense... this way of your 
thinking of me and speaking to me, is unapt of you in the right your mind...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 18: "Oh, modest lady, on refusing me you surely become remorseful like Uurvashi who once kicked Puruurava 
with her feet. [3-48-18]

[Commentary] Uurvashi is one among the four celestial chief maidens, apsara-s, namely, Uurvashi, Rambha, Menaka 
and Tiolottama. When Vishnu was in His meditation all the other apsara-s came to Him to disturb His 
meditation. Knowing that, Vishnu gave birth to this Uurvashi from his things. Thus, she is called 
the one who came from thighs uuruH 'from thighs...' and this word is defined as uru 
vaSTi 'muchly, splendorous one...' Then the other apsara-s had to accept ashamedly that 
Uurvashi is a beauty of higher order. Kalidasa took this as his subject for his drama 
'Vikramorvashiiyam.'

Shlok 19: "He that Rama is merely a human, and in war he equals me not by my finger, oh, richly colourful lady, 
and I chanced here merely by your serendipity, thus you honour me and my desire to possess you..." Thus 
Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-48-19]

[Commentary] 'Serendipity' is the faculty of making happy and unexpected discoveries by accident... coined by 
Horace Walpole [1754] after The Three Princes of Serendip [now Sri Lanka,] a fairy tale. Now as a 
Lankan, let Ravana also say so.

[Commentary] Ravana, the devotee is saying: yuddhe 'in war...' yasya angulyaaH samaH ko api na asti
'whose, finger, equalling, whoever, even, not, there...' yaH saH raamaH ' who, he, is 
Rama... or, Vishnu Himself...' maanuSaH 'humanly incarnate...' tam 'him, such a 
Rama...' mama bhaagyena 'by my, fortune...' sampraaptam 'presently' let that Rama 
arrive [in Lanka...]' bhajasva 'him, that Rama, you hold him in honour...'

[Commentary] "In battlefield none can match that Rama even by his little finger, for He is none other than 
Vishnu, and such a Vishnu chanced here in the human incarnation as Rama, and let fortune betide me 
and let that Rama arrive in my Lanka, and you be instrumental to his arrival, then you may hold that 
Rama in high honour... for all this to happen first you come with me..." Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 20: Vaidehi who is spoken thus is infuriated on her part and with her eyes bloodshot spoke these bitter 
words to the king of demons in that lonely lace. [3-48-20]

[Commentary] The lonely place is an advantageous place for such tempters. But if the tempted is self-controlled, 
nothing adverse can happen. raagam viviktaa iti vardhayanti 'inclination increases in 
isolation...' But Seetha is disinclined to any such advances or lures or temptations. Some 
discussion is there in endnote.

Shlok 21: "How you wish to commit sins although saying that Kubera, a god reverenced by all of the gods, is your 
brother? [3-48-21]

Shlok 22: "All the demons will perforce get completely destroyed, oh, Ravana, for whom you the cruel and culpable 
one with uncontrolled senses is the king, and you will be blameworthy for the elimination of righteous 
demons like Vibheeshana, et al. [3-48-22]

Shlok 23: "It may be possible to live after abducting Shaci Devi, the wife of Indra, somehow and anyhow there 
will be no liveability after abducting me, the wife of Rama. [3-48-23]

Shlok 24: "Oh, demon, un-mirrored is the prettiness of prettyish Shaci Devi, and one may live long on forcibly 
snatching her away from the hands of the wielder of Thunderbolt, Indra, but to him who intimidates or 
abuses me or women like me, there will be no moksha, release from the cycle of rebirth, 
even if he has consumed amR^ita ambrosia." Thus Seetha spoke to Ravana. [3-48-24]

[Commentary] Seetha iterated twice about Shaci Devi for reinforcing her argument. She did not
say 'on abducting me you will not survive...' but said 'on abducting me, or women like me...' this
is to say that any husband devote-wife is not to be subjected to such humiliation. Further, this is
for ashliila nivaaraNa artham 'to avoid obscenity from the mouth of this principal
character in legend....' Govindaraja. As Seetha is unsure whether Ravana consumed ambrosia or not,
but, 'if your-like malicious minded beings, though they have gulped amR^ita 'ambrosia'
there is no moksha 'release, deliverance...' from death-birth cycle and that
moksha is possible through wise thinking... and, as your soul is full with foulness, that
unwise state of yours will never attain moksha...' Rama Tilaka Commentary.



SARGA 49
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha's abduction takes place now. Ravana forcefully abducts Seetha in his air-chariot. She bewails 
and bemoans for Rama and Lakshmana and appeals to all nature to inform Rama about this abduction. Finally, 
she sees Jatayu, the eagle, and asks him to narrate her abduction to Rama.

Shlok 1: On hearing Seetha's words that valorous ten-headed Ravana loudly clapped in dissent for once and divulged 
his very mighty body. [3-49-1]

[Commentary] These beings, including Hanuma, change into titanic form when they are infuriated. A cruel aspect minus 
anger is not in consonance with each. Thus, Ravana got wild first, but he does not want to hide his 
reality before his Goddess Lakshmi, hence he divulged his real aspect. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 2: That wordsmith Ravana again spoke these words to Maithili, "Perhaps you have not heard about my valour 
and vanquishes in all your madness for Rama. [3-49-2]

[Commentary] Ravana as devotee is saying to Seetha: 'unheard are my valour and vanquishes na unmattayaa : matta 
janaat udgataa unmatta bhinna taa dR^ishayaa 'not mad... you are far from the maddened crowd, you 
are opposite of a mad personality...' na unmattayaa tvayaa na shrutau manye... 'though you 
are not a madcap in reality, you did not give any ear to my valour and vanity...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

[Commentary] Once the demon Mahisha-asura was eliminated by Goddess Durga, a female, and Ravana is now talking to 
a female, [and maybe she is also in disguise like him.] If this woman assumes her real nature at the 
time of abduction, the abduction will not be easy and handy. Hence, before her assuming her real form, 
it is better to show his real entity. Thus, he clapped for once before changing into his real entity. 
Or, the role-play of a Brahman sanyasi is not in consonance with the villainous abduction and that garb 
of a Brahman itself is a hindrance to his original atrocious nature known to world as raa vaNa 'one 
who makes people to cry...' thus vexed with this role-paying of a Brahman, he clapped loudly and infuriately, 
for once. Rama Tilaka.

Shlok 3: "Standing on the sky I can lift up the earth with two of my arms, I can completely gulp down any ocean, 
standing in war I can even put the Death to death. [3-49-3]

Shlok 4: "Indeed, I can split the Sun and splinter the earth with my splitting arrows, oh, mad woman, I can assume 
any form as I wish, and endow any wish you wish, such as I am, I must be your husband, behold me." So 
said Ravana when revealing his real nature. [3-49-4]

Shlok 5: While the infuriated Ravana is saying in that way his eyes which by themselves are torchlit in their 
shine have became further bloodshot and blackened at their edges. [3-49-5]

Shlok 6: Immediately discarding the gentle form of a Brahman friar, that younger brother of Kubera, Ravana, assumed 
his own ferocious form which is similar to the form of Terminator. [3-49-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: That celebrated Ravana whose eyes are bloodshot as he is ensorcelled by desperate fury transmuted his 
form into a tend-faced, twenty-armed night-walker wearing golden ornaments of purified gold and appearing 
as a black tempestuous cloud. [3-49-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: On discarding that guise of a Brahman friar that sovereign of demons Ravana educed his own physique 
and then that mighty bodied one attired in reddish clothing stood before Maithili observing that gem 
of a lady. [3-49-8b, 9]

[Commentary] He stood before her showing his mighty physique, expecting her to yield on seeing such a magnificent 
manly physique, which dissimilar to the girlish physique of her husband Rama.

Shlok 10: She whose tresses are glossily blackish until their ends, and who has on her glittering jewellery and 
silken-ochry-sari, whereby who is imperceivable like sun's glaring shine, to such Maithili Ravana spoke. 
[3-49-10]

Shlok 11: "If you wish to have a husband of well-renown in three worlds you seek shelter in me, oh, high-hipped 
lady, I alone will match up to you as husband. [3-49-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: "Ultimately you have a much-lauded husband in me, as such you oblige me, and I will not cause any displeasure 
to you at any point of time. Let your heart refrain from that humanly Rama and you start bringing round 
your heart towards me. [3-49-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14- 15a: "Oh, halfwitted lady, you who deem yourself a highly intellectual lady, listen, that mindless Rama who 
just by a word of a woman forebode kingdom along with all of his amiable people, and lives in this forest 
where the predators are on the prowl, thus he who is spurned off from kingdom, ungainful are his purposes, 
and who is even a short-lived human, I wonder by what merits you are impassioned for such a Rama?" Thus 
Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-49-13b, 14, 15a]

[Commentary] For the verses from 11 to 14 Maheshvara Tiirtha, a very ancient commentator, tries hard to establish 
Ravana as an absolute devotee of Goddess Lakshmi, for Ravana himself was their doorkeeper in heaven 
before his accursed being. He is one from the two doorkeepers in vaikuNTha 'abode of Lord Vishnu 
and Lakshmi' called Jaya and Vijaya Ravana is Jaya, the doorkeeper. That commentary is like 
this. yadi aham patiH 'if, I am, the lord...' raakshasaam iti seSaH elliptic, 'of 
demons...' tava sadR^ishaH : kim bhR^itya - iti seSaH 'you befitting, elliptic, am I a befitting 
servant - no I am not...' 'Although I am not a good servant of yours, but if you wish to me be one,
triSu lokeSu vikhyaataam yathaa tathaa 'as if to become famous in all the three worlds...'
maam bhartaaram aashraya 'me, as servant, accept...' Here bharta is defined as 
shushruuSa aadinaa svaaminam bibharti iti bhartaa - bhR^itya iti arthaH 'one who serves his master 
by his services is bhartaa. Thus bhartaa does not only mean a husband but also a servant. 
Why should she accept Ravana now as a newly recruited servant? Because ciraaya tava shlaaghyaH
'for a long time I have been extolling you in vaikunTha as Jaya...' and I am a priya 
: priiNayati iti shshruuSa aadinaa svaaminam - iti priya bhR^ityaH 'a dear, earnest servant of 
yours...' maam bhajasva 'you know me thus as your humble servant...' maanuSe bhaava tyajataam
'humans only are to be saved..' - you leave this thinking and think that we the demons are also 
to be saved...' muuDhe paNDita maaninii mayi bhaava praNiiyataam 'Although I am an unread stupid, 
grace me too because I am your long serving servant...' Further, Rama is raajyaat cyutam 'not 
fallen from kingship, but he is a spurner of kingly pleasures, he thrusts these small things back with 
his foot...' why because a siddha artham - ashca asau siddha arthaH ca 'Vishnu is one with 
His purposes fulfilled... thus He does not care for a petty kingdom, when He is the King of Kings...'
parimita aayuSam : parigatam - tyaktam; mitam - alpam - aayuH yena tam - a parimita aayuSam 
'He is an eternal entity...' kaiH guNaiH - kaiH= anirvacaniiya; guNaiH= ananta kalyaaNa guNa shiila
'One with indefinable, illimitable auspicious merits...' anuraktaa asi 'you are impassioned 
for such a Vishnu, though... and I have no objection for that, but bless me too... durmati : duSTeSu 
api matiH - anugraahikaa buddhi 'He is not a mindless person, but he has a mind for the mindless 
and bad-minded persons like me... So please come with me and let your husband follow you to Lanka and 
accord salvation, as planned by you all...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

Shlok 15b- 16: On saying that sentence to Maithili, who by herself is a nice talker and who is a proper one for addressing 
with nice words, that verily evil-minded demon Ravana maddened by lust drew nigh of Seetha and grabbed 
her, as Budha, the Jupiter grabs the Star Rohini in firmament. [3-49-15b, 16]

[Commentary] What happened to the lakshmaNa rekha? 'A boundary drawn by Lakshmana when he departed Seetha 
in search of Rama?' Some discussion about this is there in the endnote. Here, even though Ravana is
su duSTa aatmaa, kaama mohitaa 'a very wicked souled and lustily crazed....' it is all for 
other women, but not towards Seetha. And thus he caught hold of Seetha, as the planet Budha, Jupiter, 
the son of Moon catches his own Star mother Rohini, a dear wife the Moon, reverentially. Maheshvara 
Tiirtha. Later commentators rejected this saying that, if it were to be so, then Ravana has Oedipus 
complex.

Shlok 17: He that Ravana grabbed the lotus-eyed Seetha on lifting her up with his left hand at her plait of hair 
at nape, and with his right hand at her thighs. [3-49-17]

Shlok 18: On seeing him who grabbed Seetha, who has incisive fangs, mightily armed and who is shining forth like 
a mountain crest and similar to Death, the forest deities quickly fled away terrorised by his terrorism. 
[3-49-18]

Shlok 19: Then the miracle-air-chariot of Ravana which is miraculously designed to appear and disappear at the 
wish of its master, yoked with miraculous mules, and built with its golden wheels and parts, appeared 
afore Ravana braying noisily. [3-49-19]

Shlok 20: Then he whose voice is strident that Ravana lifted her up by her waist and got Vaidehi up on the air-chariot 
intimidating her with bitter words. [3-49-20]

Shlok 21: Agonised with anguish when gone into the captivity of Ravana, she that glorious Seetha wailed loudly 
for Rama saying 'oh, Rama,' which Rama has gone deep into the forest by then. [3-49-21]

Shlok 22: Ravana who is infatuated with lust picked her up, which lady is disinclined for any kind of sensuality 
and who is verily writhing like the wife of King Cobra, and then he surged skyward and flew off with 
her in his air-chariot. [3-49-22]

Shlok 23: While that lord of demons is abducting her in the skyway, Seetha became frenzied with bewildered faculties 
and then bawled stridently like a hysterical person. [3-49-23]

Shlok 24: "Haa, greatly dextrous Lakshmana... oh, rejoicer of your mentor... you are incognisant of me who am 
being abducted by this demon who is a dissembler. [3-49-24]

[Commentary] Seetha tongue-lashed this Lakshmana alone in the earlier chapters and him alone she is addressing now, 
that too firstly, before calling Rama, that too addressing as 'dextrous one...' Is she self-contradictory? 
Not so, 'Lakshmana is the one who can protect even the self-reliant Rama, then where is the question 
of his not protecting Seetha from any calamity?' is her reasoning. On the other hand, Lakshmana left 
the hermitage just now, so he must be within earshot, while Rama went into deep of the forest long back.

Shlok 25: "Oh, Raghava, you have relinquished your high-life, happiness, and riches for the sake of righteousness, 
and though you avowed to protect your observants, you are unobservant of me who am being abducted by 
the unrighteousness itself. [3-49-5]

Shlok 26: "Oh, enemy-inflamer Rama, I reckon that you are an absolute controller of uncontrollable beings, I wonder 
why you are not controlling this kind of sinner, Ravana, indeed?" This is how Seetha started her cry 
in wilderness. [3-49-26]

Shlok 27: "Indeed, the result for an evil act will not be apparent instantaneously. Even the time becomes a factor 
in the matter of cause and effect, as with the crops becoming cookable after certain time lag." Thus, 
she is addressing Ravana now. [3-49-27]

Shlok 28: "The Time has battered your brains and as an infringer you have undertaken this particular exploit, 
whereby you will get a devastating and life-ending tribulation from Rama." Thus, she upbraided Ravana. 
[3-49-28]

Shlok 29: "An honest wife of a glorious one who aspires nothing but honesty, such a wife of Rama as I am, I am 
being abducted, thus the aspiration of Kaikeyi and her kinfolk has now come true. Oh, god!" Thus, she 
soliloquised. [3-49-29]

[Commentary] Rama also talks in this way when Viraadha abducted Seetha in the opening chapter of this Aranya Kanda. 
This small talk is more humanly as said: supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j~naanam dR^iSTam 'in 
the delirious or furious conditions, one's own heart is outspoken...' and if it is spoken in anger none 
but their antagonists are envisaged, firstly.

Shlok 30: "I call the attention of the flowered Karnikaara trees of Janasthaana, you inform Rama that Ravana is 
thieving Seetha." Thus, she is addressing the woods and others on the ground from air-chariot. [3-49-30]

Shlok 31: "I pray you who are with the bustle of swans and saarasa water birds, oh, River Godavari, you promptly 
tell Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha. [3-49-31]

[Commentary] This does not mean that this request is as good as asking that river to overflow its banks to go to 
Rama and tell the news. It is: "I pray you to tell this news to any one of the bustling birds in your 
lap and that bird swiftly takes to flight to go to Rama and informs him, because the birds are also 
sympathetic with Rama and with me, as well...' This is hamsa sandesha, saarasa sandesha which 
idea became more famous at a later time for the emergence of masterpieces like megha sandesha 
of Kalidasa and hamsa sandesha in nala damayanti upaakhyaana.

Shlok 32: "I also venerate you, the sylvan deities that travel in this forest with diverse trees or, those that 
abide on the treetops, you may please inform my husband that I am being stolen. [3-49-32]

[Commentary] The word namaskaromi is of two parts: namaH, karomi and this namaH is again 
cleavable as na mama 'not, mine...' 'I have no 'I-ness' and I wholly submit my 'my-ness' unto 
you...' Thus namaH kaomi is 'I am making myself in submission to you...' and if this said with 
the gesture of adjoined palms called an~jali, which in Latin is iungo, iungere and 
if iun is read as an` and ng be read as j~na of Sanskrit, this
iungo is also an~jali as Latin has many Sanskrit words in it. Then this is called
namaskaara baaNa 'a salutation-arrow' more like a cupid's arrow to bring two together... not 
necessarily a male and a female, but any two or more, in veneration or friendship.

Shlok 33: "Or, over there, some few beings that are living over there on the ground below, I seek shelter of all 
the flocks of birds and hoards of animals, and I pray you to convey this news. [3-49-33]

[Commentary] Seetha firstly appealed to the trees frenziedly. But reasoning herself that the trees can tell only 
when Rama comes to them, for they cannot move, and then she appealed to River Godavari and her swans. 
Presuming that the water loving water birds may not penetrate the deep forest, and then she appealed 
the sylvan deities presiding on the treetops. Again presuming that these sylvan deities of forests may 
not be able to see through the thick of forest, she is now asking the animals and birds that usually 
move on the ground, to locate Rama. This entire criss-cross thinking has happened within split seconds.

Shlok 34: "Inform my husband about his dear and loftier wife than his lives, saying that, 'helpless Seetha is 
stolen by Ravana.' [3-49-34]

Shlok 35: "If that ambidextrous Rama comes to know about me, even if I am taken to heavens, or, even if I am impounded 
by Death, that great-mighty Rama brings me back, on aggressing against all of the gods in heaven, or, 
against Yama, the Death God." Thus, she appealed to one and all, but in vain. [3-49-35]

Shlok 36: She that wide-eyed Seetha who is highly anguished and bewailing with pitiable words then with a wide-eyed 
expectancy saw the eagle Jatayu perching on a tree. [3-49-36]

Shlok 37: She that well-waisted lady who has gone into the captivity of Ravana craned and stared at the eagle, 
and worsted by fear she shrieked squeakily with a stuttering voice that is walloped with anguish. [3-49-37]

Shlok 38: "Oh, fatherly Jatayu, see me, like an orphanized one I am pitiably abducted by this lord of demons with 
sinister deeds. [3-49-38]

Shlok 39: "It is impossible for you to forestall this merciless night-walker, for he is formidable, shining forth 
with cunning conquests, also thus this wicked minded one is with weaponry. [3-49-39]

Shlok 40: "Oh, Jatayu, everything about my abduction shall be narrated to Rama, or to Lakshmana, as it has happened 
in its entirety." Thus Seetha supplicated Jatayu. [3-49-40]

[Commentary] Nobility will not seek help selfishly; if help is sought that way, the seeker instantly becomes an ignoble, 
falling from the heights of personal nobility. Seetha may be an impetuous lady but if she talking to 
a noble elderly person or being, she talks judiciously in all her humbleness. Here she is not asking 
Jatayu to wage a war against Ravana to save her. She is asking Jatayu to convey the news of her abduction 
to Rama, because as an old eagle, as old as her father-in-law, Jatayu may not fight back this Ravana 
successfully. Besides, Ravana is with weaponry and a cunning warrior. Jatayu may be a powerful eagle, 
but if it comes to weapons and missiles, a natural being cannot withstand the artificial ammunition 
of war. Hence, visualising the danger in Jatayu's attempting any combat with Ravana, she is asking him 
to be the carrier of news, as all the trees, river and her birds, sylvan deities, and the other birds 
and animals are not heedful of her request, and this eagle alone is beheld, besides being an old acquaintance.

[Commentary] Whether Seetha is touched by Ravana or not - is a much debated issue by ancient commentators. When Ravana 
is carrying a curse on his head, that makes his head/heads to be splintered, if he lustfully touches 
any woman, against her will, it is questioned how his head is not splintered now, when touching Seetha. 
Maheshvara Tiirtha brings in skaanda puraaNa which says that: chaayaa graahitvam api asi 
sarva vidyaa vishaarade | kesha chaayaam paraamR^ishya jaanu chaayam tahaiva ca | gR^ihiitvaa jaanakiim 
hR^iShTo lankaam praayaa tathaa eva ca | 'Ravana being an expert in all branches of sciences, caught 
Janaki by the shadow of her head-hair and the shadow of thighs...' Maheshvara Tiirtha.

[Commentary] For this Rama Tilaka says yet another way of catching Seetha, as explained for the verse at 3-49-17:
muurdhajeSu kareNa : muudhaja iSu kareNa 'best ones, arrows, with hands...' 'with the hands 
that handle the best arrows... Seetha is caught...' vaama kareNa uurvo saH pari jagraaha here 
the word uuru which usually translates as 'thighs' is said as 'feet...' 'Ravana caught hold 
of her feet as the Planet Budha, the Jupiter caught the feet of his mother Star Rohini in early times; 
and now iks requesting his personal deity Goddess Lakshmi to come to Lanka. Rama Tilaka.

[Commentary] Catching Seetha while she is standing is not possible in both the ways as said above. She should be 
in a supine position on ground to handle her from under her thighs or at the nape of the neck. Her falling 
on ground is not explicitly said in these verses in Aranya. But Seetha says at verse 3-49-34, that 'in 
a state of helplessness, I am abducted...' This word vivasha, vi vashatvam is not only 'helplessness...' 
but also a state of 'swooning...' She repeats the same wording in Sundara Kanda and even in Yuddha Kanda 
II at verse 8 of 116 sarga, while replying Rama's accusation, in saying that yadi aham gaatra samsparsham 
gataa asmi vivashaa prabho 'when I was 'helpless' I was touched by Ravana... fault is not mine, 
gods alone have fouled it...' Thus, it is assumed that Seetha was in a short swoon when caught by Ravana. 
Then again, when she was rolling on ground in the same state Ravana lifts her up by her waist into his 
air-chariot.

[Commentary] All this discussion is to establish Seetha is an 'untouchable' for others, and for fear of a blemish 
to her paativratya 'husband-devotness...' which topic will be raised by no other than Rama, 
after war. The absolute devotees of Rama or Seetha hold Ravana's touching Seetha, as an intolerable 
act. Thus, to portray that Seetha is 'untouchable' there are many more legends woven around this topic.

[Commentary] One among it is lakshmaNa rekha 'Lakshmana's drawing a line around the hermitage, like a firewall...' 
When Seetha transgressed this firewall and came out of it to offer alms to Ravana, in Brahman sanyaasi's 
guise, she in her fear fell down on ground, as said in aadhyaatma raamaayaNa in the verse:
tato vidaarya dharaNiim nakhaiH uddhR^itya baahubhiH | tolayitvaa rathe kShiptaa yayau kShipram 
vihaayasaa || 'then [Ravana] cleaved the earth with his nails, uplifting that clod with his hands 
and with a balancing act put it in the air-chariot, and quickly went away in skyway...'

[Commentary] Another anthology says that Rama while going after the Golden Deer, hid the real Seetha and placed a
maayaa siitaa ' an illusory Seetha...' in the cottage. This deceptive Seetha is continued until 
her self-immolation after Great War. Real Seetha emerged out of the pyre instead of this Maya Seetha. 
Then it is questioned, whether the bemoaning and bewailing of Rama for Seetha, throughout the later 
part of the epic is to hoodwink the readers or so? It is then replied that this also is one among the 
many miraculous effects of Vishnu viSNu maaya All this culminates into the saying of Bhagavad 
Gita: vyavasaayaatmikaa buddhiH eka iha kuru nandana | bahu shakhaa hi anantaah ca buddhayo avyavasaayiNaam 
|| 2-41 'the object to determine is distinct singularly, and many and unending are those who say 
manifoldly with indistinct minds....'

[Commentary] Nothing happens by mere touching of Seetha, for she is a resolute lady to abide by her husband Rama. 
Valmiki is very clear in picturing her to be a stubborn and staunch husband-devote, and no more mythological 
bends are required to prove her chastity. She herself proved this with her agni pravesha ' 
self-immolation...' to all concerned. If Seetha acquired a blemish by mere touch, then Draupadi will 
be in a more pathetic state, since she is physically handled by Keecaka, that too when she is in her 
senses. The common feature in both the cases is, some other man 'touching their braids...' A woman's 
head hair cannot be touched by anybody in molestation. atra dashagriivo atyanta avamati ruupam kula 
kShaya karam kesha grahaNam svasya bhavitavya anuruupatayaa kR^itavaa | kesha grahaNasya - sabhaa nayana 
- paruSha bhaaShaNa - vastra apaharaNa - aadi apekShayaa - vadhopekShayaa ca atyanta avamati karatvam 
kula kShaya karatva ca bhaarate prati paaditam - dk 'Ravana is predestined for self-ruin, hence 
touched the braid of Seetha, and touching the braid of a lady, dragging her to king's court, roughly 
talking to her, undressing her, all these lead to the destruction of one's own clan, as demonstrated 
in Maha Bharata...' In vana parva of mahA bhaarata, when Draupadi goes on complaining that 
'I am dragged by my braid... I am dragged by my braid...' Krishna says to Draupadi: rudiShyanti 
striyo hi evam yeShaam kruddhaa asi bhaamini | satyam te pratijaanaaami raaj~naa raaj~nii bhaviShyasi 
|| 'you women always go on weeping for such tings... [having suffered in such a way,] I promise 
that you alone will become the empress...' So also, Seetha is instrumental for the elimination of evil, 
called Ravana together with all his clansmen. This is as pledged by Veadavati, an earlier incarnation 
of Goddess Lakshmi. As such, Seetha has to go to Lanka to attend that complete eradication, according 
to mythology.

[Commentary] Whether it is myth or real she is not all a frailty to yield up that easily nor a weak bodied one for 
an easy molestation. She travelled the length and breadth of the country barefooted, that too in impenetrable 
forests. These ladies of lore had their yogic faculties with which Gaandhaari, the mother Duryodhana, 
in Maha Bharata makes him a diamond-bodied one, excepting his thighs. Their words come true if they 
utter them with certain concentration. At the time of burning the tail of Hanuma in Sundara Kaanda Seetha 
says: siito bhava 'cool down...' 'Let the fire on the tail of that monkey be coolant to him...' 
and it happened accordingly. That burning tail burnt whole Lanka, except some places, without any scorching 
effect on Hanuma. Likewise she would have said at Ravana hato bhava 'dead, you are...' but 
she does not say so. Rama's pledge to saints and sages to eliminate evil on earth is to be fulfilled 
by Rama alone.

[Commentary] Leaving the untouchablness or otherwise of Seetha aside, since every negative act is to be solemnised, 
let us listen to the fruits of listening or reading of this episode, siitaa apaharaNa 'abduction 
of Seetha...' as it involves the elimination of evil on earth, Skanda Puraana says 'nothing 
inauspicious will happen to those best people who listen this episode of Seetha's abduction...'



SARGA 50
------------------------------

[Text] Jataayu confronts Ravana on hearing the wailing of Seetha. He boldly forestalls Ravana and his air-chariot 
in the sky itself, and as an elderly being he reviles Ravana from the viewpoint of righteousness befitting 
to kings, but of no avail. His dilemma is that he cannot take flight to Rama's place, nor he can forestall 
Ravana until Rama comes. Yet, he persists to affront Ravana.

Shlok 1: Jataayu who is slumbering away craned and stared on hearing the voicing of Seetha and then he saw Ravana 
and even Vaidehi. [3-50-1]

Shlok 2: That best bird majestic Jataayu with a very sharp beak and appearing like a mountain peak, then uttered 
these words of expediency still perching on a tree. [3-50-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: "Oh, brother, now it is inapt of you to undertake a deplorable deed. I am one of those who abide by 
perpetual probity and avowed to truthfulness. Such as I am, oh, Decahedral-demon Ravana, I am the mightiest 
king of eagles known by the name Jataayu. [3-50-3, 4a]

[Commentary] This self-assured statement of Jataayu is like this: aham puraaNe dharme sthitaH 'I abide by 
the sanaatana dharama, 'The Eternal Virtue...' 'belonging to the master and the servant...'
aham daashyaH, 'I am a humble servant of Supreme Soul...' aham satya samshrayaH, 'I 
am sheltered by the Everlasting Truth... that Everlasting Truth is made known in satyam j~naanam 
anantam brahma... and thus bhagavat ekopaaya niSTaH, 'I have a complete dedication unto 
god...' - 'I with my unwavering determination am subservient to Him alone, and such as I am, in my presence 
you cannot undertake a deplorable deed, deplorable to that Eternal Virtue or to three worlds...' On 
telling about himself, next he started to tell about his master. Govindaraja.

Shlok 4b- 5a: "Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is the master of all the world, one similar to Mahendra and Varuna, the 
Rain-god, and the one who is connected with the well-being of all the world. [3-50-4b, 5a]

[Commentary] The simile of Indra and Rain-god to Rama is to say that 'Rama is a bestower of rains and livelihood 
like Indra, the presiding deity of east, through the Rain-god, the presiding deity of west, unlike you 
who are a pilferer... and he is the preserver of all the worlds... so, you also get persevered by him, 
because he is also the lord of yours...' Govindaraja.

Shlok 5b- 6a: "Whom you desire to abduct now, that best lady is Seetha by her name, and this glorious one is the legitimate 
wife of that preserver of all the worlds, namely Rama. [3-50-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "How a king adhering to probity can lay his hands on the wives of others? If it is a king's wife, oh, 
great-mighty Ravana, she is to be safeguarded particularly. [3-50-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8: "Reverse your filthy course, or fortuity, or mind form laying your hands on other's wives. A sagacious 
person does not undertake that deed by which others deplore him. As with the protection of one's own 
wife from somebody's laying hands on her, other person's wife is also to be protected in that way. [3-50-8 
[3-50-7b, 8]

[Commentary] If it is asked that a king's wife is a special entity to be protected, and then other's wives are less 
fortunate or what? Not so, it is said that the wife of a king is a motherly entity. Other's wives may 
become sisters or sister-in-laws etc., but a mother is a mother. The difference in dealing with a king's 
wife and with wife of a commoner is that of a difference between a sinner and a criminal. Either way 
unrighteous it is. The very basic concept of wooing others' wives itself, is both a crime and a sin.
'R^itaa upeyaat...' iti shaastraat - gamyaa sva bhaaryaa | anyaa bhaaryaa agamyaa iti- maadhava 
aacaarya - dk.

[Commentary] Here the word 'king' also denotes the god, as Manu uses the word 'raajaa' for Yama, the Terminator yamo 
vaivasvato raajaa yaH tava eSa hR^iodi sthitaa... For this, Ravana may refute saying, 'this Rama may 
be a god of yours... but not mine...' And for this it is countered in saying, devaanaam ca devataaanaam 
ca saamaanyam adhi daivam... 'there is no your god or my god, but god is one... to everyone...'

[Commentary] Jataayu is asking for a reversal of Ravana's mind or course, otherwise misfortune likely to happen to 
him. Further, being a king one shall never do a deplorable and unkingly act.

Shlok 9: "If the means to gain probity, or prosperities, or even pleasures are inconspicuous in scriptures, oh, 
the scion of Paulastya, then even the erudite scholars will conduct themselves following the king and 
his demeanour. [3-50-9]

[Commentary] There is another flex for the raajaanam anu as raajaanam anu as raajaanam iva 
'like king, like subjects...' shiSTaaH  'anyone who takes recourse to righteous behaviour...' Because the king shall possess an aptitude to 
go through the scriptures and ascertain what is right and what is wrong, then only his subjects will 
follow likewise. Even if the course of conduct is imperceptible in scriptures, a king shall decide the 
right way, and thus the subjects automatically follow him, in the same way... thus, 'being a king, yet 
behaving like a criminal and a sinner, is inapt of you...' so said Jataayu to Ravana. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

[Commentary] Ravana is the son of Vishravasa who again is the son of Pulastya, the brainchild of Brahma, who are 
all supposed to be the well-read scholars in all scriptures and sciences. Hence, Jataayu is addressing 
Ravana to remember his scholarship, which is in effrontery with his present behaviour. And the suggestion 
that 'protect wives of others persons as you protect your own wife...' is to say that 'if somebody from 
your subjects, on following your present path, gains access to your wife Mandodari, do you tolerate?'

Shlok 10: "A king is the best repository for probity, prosperities, and pleasures, and whether it is probity or 
felicity or even iniquity that will emerge from the fount called king. [3-50-10]

[Commentary] Other mms read raajaa dharmasya kaamasya... then 'the king is the root
cause for the prevalence of probity, felicity etc. anena prajaa raajaanam anusaranti iti
suucitam... dk 'subjects follow what a king does...'

Shlok 11: "Oh, prominent one among demons, deviltry and mercuriality are but natural for you demons, but how you 
have amassed affluence, as with an evildoer attaining an aircraft that puts him to flight to heaven.



"You by your nature are a devilish and mercurial personality though you have come from a decent lineage, 
how you have become an outranking demon among demons and how you could attain kingdom, which is to be 
ruled righteously, like an evildoer attaining a heaven-bound aircraft. [3-50-11]

Shlok 12: "He whose nature is such, that nature is perhaps impossible to efface, a sermon does not dwell in the 
heart of an evil-minded one for a long time, indeed.



"He whose nature itself is vile, it is perhaps impossible for him to efface it, and in the residence 
of such an evil-minded person, evilly acquired prosperity does not dwell for a long time, indeed. [3-50-12]

[Commentary] Ruling the kingdom righteously, in itself is a merit that leads that king to heavens. When the kingdom 
itself is acquired unrighteously, and so the oppulence, there is no question of merit or heaven, or 
even an air ticket to that heaven. For such persons, all these are ad hoc luxuries.
anena paapiShTasya 
aishvaryam na bhavati | praaptam cet api na tiShTati - adharmaat ca eva nahuShaH pratipede rasaatalam 
- kaamandaka - dk

[Commentary] The reference to an aircraft that carries Ravana to heaven is not the Pushpaka aircraft, which he already 
grabbed from Kubera. The airports of Pushpaka aircraft are in the mortal worlds and in heavens it can 
land at the best in Indra's heaven, say paradise. There is no entry for these petty airships into the 
higher realms of Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheshvara if piloted by Ravana like demons.

Shlok 13: "When that great-mighty Rama has not transgressed either in your country or in your city Lanka, then 
how you become a transgressor in respect of that noble-souled Rama? [3-50-13]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'you may say that abduction of enemy's wife is my hobby... but you are abducting the wife of 
one who is neither a friend nor an enemy of yours... why for is this fancy when viewed in the prospective 
of righteousness or polity of kingships... anena anaparaadhiShu 
samiiciineShu aparaadho na kartavyam iti suucitam | tathaa ca udyoga parve - mahaa bhaarate - duryodhanam

mithyaa raajan pravartate || iti - dk 'No unilateral aggression is desirable at the unaggressive 
lot... Thus, Lord Krishna says to Duryodhana in Udyoga parva of Maha Bharata: broadly: 'a wood is felled 
by its own kin-wood, namely a wooden shaft attached to the axe... so, the present pseudo-kings will 
be felled down by their own kinsfolk...'

[Commentary] Jataayu's questioning is the same that was once Seetha asked Rama in the early chapters of Aranya, 'why 
wage a war without a cause...' She must have understood the answer by now by the acts of Ravana.

Shlok 14: "If Rama of indefatigable deeds firstly eliminated Khara who is stationed at Janasthaana, and who transgressed 
for the sake of Shuurpanakha, tell me what in actuality is the highly overstepping behaviour of Rama 
in that matter, whereupon you are stealing off with the wife of such a lord of world? [3-50-14, 15]

Shlok 16: "Instantly deliver up Vaidehi. Let not the disastrous and glowing fire-like eyes of Rama, which transmogrify 
so when he assumes fury, burn you down as the Thunderbolt of Indra once burnt the demon Vritta. [3-50-16]

Shlok 17: "You are unconscious that you have presently bundled a lethally venomous serpent at the fringe of your 
attire, and you are equally unwary that the Terminator's lasso is presently loosened around your neck. 
[3-50-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, cultured one, that weight alone is to be shouldered by which a man is not brought down, and that 
repast alone is to be consumed by which nothing upsets. [3-50-18]

[Commentary] Futile is the experimentation with impossible undertakings as they will be upsetting normalcy. 
anena ashakyam 
karma na kartavyam iti suucitm | tathaa ca kaamandake - shakya ashakya paricchedam kuryaat budhyaa prasannatayaa

is to be assessed firstly, with a judicious mind... one's own teeth may not be hit with a stone, only 
to examine how easily they can be broken by that stone...'

Shlok 19: "Who will undertake a deed that yields neither probity, nor deference, nor distinction but results in 
just physical drudgery? [3-50-19]

[Commentary] The words kiirti, yashaas may look synonymous but have been defined separately. kiirti 
is the fame which arises from acts of valour, etc., while yashas is the fame which arises from 
acts of charity and the like. In another way kiirti is the renown obtained from doing merited 
and socio-economic deeds done through conducting Vedic rituals and the like, and yashas is 
the renown obtained from having riches, wealth, and affluence. Rama Tilaka says that kiirti = deshaantara 
khyaati fame which 'spreads in countries beyond one's own country...' while yashas = sva desha 
khyaaati is 'the fame confined to one's own country.' Dr. Satya Vrat is of the opinion that 'which 
of the two explanations of the commentator, Rama Tilaka, is acceptable and more reasonable we cannot 
say in our present stage of knowledge... In fact the commentator himself is not sure; one strikes him 
at one time, and another at another place...' Kulluka Bhatt in his commentary on manu dharma shaastra 
says that jiivataH khyati ruupam - yashaH 'fame in living time is yashaH and the other
mR^itasya khyaati ruupam - kiirtim 'the fame that remains after death is kiirti

[Commentary] Fruitless, wearisome undertakings are meaningless thus they need not be undertaken.
ananena niShphalam 
aayaasakaram karma na aarambhaNiiyam iti suucitam | tathaa ca manuH - na karma niShphalam kuryaat yasmaat 
asukhodayam - dk

Shlok 20: "I have dedicated myself to the kingdom of my fathers and forefathers according to tradition, and sixty 
thousand years have elapsed since I was born. [3-50-20]

Shlok 21: "You are youngish whereas I am oldish, you are an armoured archer darting arrows from an air-chariot, 
whereas I am pensile bird in an open sky. Nevertheless, on taking Vaidehi you cannot abscond safely. 
[3-50-21]

Shlok 22: "It will be incapable of you to forcibly abduct Vaidehi when I keep an eye one her, as with the defilement 
of definitive Vedic scriptures by the logicians, dialecticians, materialists and suchlike non-believers, 
with their conjectural logic.



"Veda-s are definitive in their canons and their authority is established beyond doubt, yet the doubtful 
scholarly logicians still try to pamper their import with their conjectural logic, and when I am watchful 
of what is going on I do not let you pamper Seetha, as such take this caution and release her. [3-50-22]

[Commentary] The Indian materialists called caarkavaa-s, or, the nihilists like Sage Jaabaali, 
who tries to preach nihilism to Rama, and the non-conformists to Veda-s, called a-Vaidika-s 
like Buddhists and Jain-s etc., try hard to let down what Veda says, with all their masterly 
dialectics. Even then, at one stage or 
the other, they all yield up, or a stalemate, or a faux pas occurs in their debates. Thus, no scholar 
need abuse the scriptures, for he does not know the subject in its entirety, or what those scriptures 
contain. anena shruti 
pratipanno artho na aabhaasaiH tarkaiH baadhayitum shakyata iti suucitam | tathaa ca manuH - yo avamanyeta 
te tuubhe hetu shaastra aashrayaat naraH | sa saadhubhiH bahiShkaaryo naastiko veda nindakaH || - dk

[Commentary] This Seetha is compared with Veda-s, one to many times, for the reason of her sacredness as a devout 
husband-devotee. Sugreeva also says this alone at 4-6-5: 'for I will fetch her very soon, like the retrieval 
of Scriptures of Veda-s...

[Commentary] Basing on these references of Seetha to Vedic canons, there is a thinking that the subject of Ramayana 
is the problem of god in retrieving the lost word, where that word was with the god at the beginning. 
Seetha is Veda, the word, Gayatri etc. And god has lost it. In search of that word, Veda, Gayatri, the 
god started his search. In his search he helps all those who abide by 'word' or 'faithful to word' and 
ultimately annihilates the demons that falsify or abuse the 'word.'

Shlok 23: "Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right 
away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. 
[3-50-23]

[Commentary] Or optionally, you can combat with me in which meantime Rama will come hither...

Shlok 24: "He who eliminated demons and ogres in combats time after time, that Rama though apparently attired 
in jute-cloths like a meek-saint, will become a towering-inferno in a given combat, and he eliminates 
you very soon. [3-50-24]

Shlok 25: "What can possibly be done by me when those princes have gone far-off! It is beyond the scope of my 
fetching them in time! You knave, you who are scared of them will now be lost to my blockade, without 
a doubt. [3-50-25]

Shlok 26: "When I am alive you cannot lead away this auspicious, lotus-leave-eyed Seetha, the dear queen of Rama. 
[3-50-26]

Shlok 27: "But I must definitely accomplish something to forestall you till they come, for I cannot willingly 
depart from here to fetch any of the two brothers, and that deed I needs must do shall be agreeable 
to the great-souled Rama, likewise even to Dasharatha, even at the stake of my life. [3-50-27]

Shlok 28: "Stopoff! Stopoff! Oh, Decahedral Ravana, briefly learn of me as how I jettison you from your best air-chariot, 
as with the unloading of a burdensome fruit from its sepals. Oh, nightwalker, I will be giving guestship 
to you in a duel as long as I am alive. [3-50-28]



SARGA 51
------------------------------

[Text] The combat of Jataayu and Ravana ensues now, as Ravana was adamantine to the righteous sermons of Jataayu. 
In combating with Ravana, Jataayu shatters Ravana's bows, arrows, and chariot and kills the mules of 
the chariot and plucks off the head of the charioteer with his beak. Further Jataayu attacks on the 
body of Ravana lacerating severally. Enraged at the bird-hits Ravana severs that eagle's wings, feet, 
and sides. Then seeing that fallen eagle Seetha weeps over, as if Jataayu is her own relative.

Shlok 1: When Ravana is spoken to by Jataayu with judicious words, Ravana's eyes reddened infuriately, and his 
burnished golden ear-knobs flickered injuriously, and that lord of demons dashed towards the lord of 
birds, intolerantly. [3-51-1]

[Commentary] Ravana's ear-knobs jerked flickeringly, as if they are fireballsas, when he gnashed his teeth in anger. Here 
another type of rendering for this verse is available in other versions, which reads: iti uktasya 
yathaa nyaayam raavaNasya jaTaayuShaa | kruddhasya agni nibhaaH sarvaa rejuH vimshati dR^iShTayaH ||'thus 
when Jataayu spoke to Ravana in judicious words, all the twenty eyes of infuriated Ravana are torched, 
like torchlit fires...'

Shlok 2: As with two gigantic clouds up-heaved by the tornadic gusts will be hard hitting each other tempestuously 
in sky, the combat between those two, Ravana and Jataayu, became tempestuous in the sky. [3-51-2]

Shlok 3: As with a startling combat between two gigantic and winged mountains, called Mt. Maalyavanta-s, that 
combat between the eagle and demon then became a startling one. [3-51-3]

[Commentary] One commentator said that one Mt. Maalyavanta is in Dandaka forest and the other in Kishkindha, while 
another commentator said that one is in Dandaka forests and the other is nearby Mt. Meru. There appears 
to be no second Mt. Maalyavanta and the poet seems to be taking one mountain and mirroring it, and thus 
saying that if two selfsame mountains were to confront, then it will be disastrous. This is to narrate 
the equivalence between their courage and strength.

Shlok 4: Then the great-mighty Ravana incessantly stormed the lord of eagles Jataayu, with arrows that have excruciating 
and highly dreadful arrowheads, like tubular arrows, iron arrows, and with arrows that have crescentic 
arrowheads. [3-51-4]

Shlok 5: That eagle Jataayu who is the lord of winged-chariots, namely birds, in turn sustained those arrays 
of Ravana's arrows in that combat. [3-51-5]

Shlok 6: But that great-mighty Jataayu severally made gashes on the body of Ravana with his two feet that have 
gashing claws for that bird is with best stamina. [3-51-6]

Shlok 7: Now the Decahedral demon Ravana infuriately took up ten deadly arrows that are similar in their shine 
to the Shafts of the Terminator, wishful of the elimination of his enemy. [3-51-7]

Shlok 8: That highly energetic Ravana released and impaled the eagle with straight shooting arrows on fully stretching 
the bowstring up to his ear, whose steel-pointed arrowheads are sharp, hurtful, and deadly. [3-51-8]

Shlok 9: That Jataayu on seeing teary-eyed Jaanaki in the chariot of the demon forcefully lunged towards that 
demon heedless of arrows that are lunging at him. [3-51-9]

Shlok 10: That unexcelled bird of high refulgence then shattered Ravana's bow which is decorated with pearls and 
gemstones, and on which an arrow is admitted targeting the eagle, just by the pair of his bare feet. 
[3-51-10]

Shlok 11: Ravana convulsed in anger then took up another bow and stormed hundreds and thousands of arrow storms. 
[3-51-11]

Shlok 12: Nested in the arrows shot by Ravana that lordly bird Jataayu then shone forth in that combat like a 
bird that obtains a readymade nest. [3-51-12]

Shlok 13: On winnowing those arrays of arrows with both of his wings, he that highly refulgent Jataayu shattered 
the mighty bow of Ravana with both of his feet. [3-51-13]

Shlok 14: That highly resplendent lord of birds also blasted off the armour of Ravana, which is glowing and flamelike 
in its flare, with both of his feet. [3-51-14]

[Commentary] The word used here for armour is sharaavara and for this Pt. Satya Vrat says: 'Another word 
which is also not noticed by Monier Williams is sharaavara. It means an armour kavaca
and occurs at least twice in the Ramayana...' i.e., here and at 3-64-49 of this canto.

Shlok 15: Mighty Jataayu also knocked off the ghost-faced mules yoked to the chariot of Ravana which are covered 
in golden armours and tantivy in fastness. [3-51-15]

Shlok 16: Then that great-chariot which is flourishing with three bamboos from chassis to yoke, and which traverses 
just by its steersman's wish, and which is crafted fantastically with gem-studded body and stairs, or, 
whose wheels are crafted with gold and gemstones, and which in its flare is like a Ritual-fire, Jataayu 
splintered down even that chariot of Ravana. [3-51-16]

Shlok 17: Jataayu swiftly collapsed the parasol of Ravana which in shine is mirroring the full moon, along with 
the regalia of white-royal-fur-fans, together with the demons handling them for fanning Ravana. [3-51-17]

Shlok 18: Again that highly energetic and imposing king of birds pecked off the robust head of the charioteer 
of Ravana with beak. [3-51-18]

Shlok 19: Now Ravana who is with his devastated bow, devoid of chariot, dispatched are his horses and departed 
is his charioteer, and such as he is, he on grabbing Vaidehi by her torso, or, placing her on the lower 
end of his torso, jumped to earth. [3-51-19]

[Commentary] Again the problem of 'untouchability of Seetha' occurred. Hence that compound ankena 
aadaaya vaidehiim 
can be expressed in two ways, one is like the usual villain's grabbing by torso, and the other is like 
an ardent devotee of Goddess Lakshmi, keeping her on his torso. This is similar to the method adopted 
by Viraadha while handling Seetha.

Shlok 20: On seeing Ravana who is foundered onto earth from his crumbled vehicle, all beings like sylvan deities, 
caarana-s, siddha-s and suchlike, reverenced that lordly eagle Jataayu. [3-51-20]

Shlok 21: But on seeing the commandant of birds Jataayu is fatigued owing to his senescence, Ravana is gladdened 
and he again rose up to skies taking Maithili. [3-51-21]

Shlok 22- 23: The highly resplendent king of eagles Jataayu swiftly rose to sky dashing practically to forestall Ravana, 
which demon's assault devices are all demolished by now save for a single sword, but who is cheerful 
to spirit away the daughter of Janaka, and actually spiriting away holding her onto his flank, and Jataayu 
spoke this to such Ravana. [3-51-22, 23]

Shlok 24: "You mean-minded Ravana, you abduct her whose husband wields arrows that touch off like the Thunderbolt 
of Indra, and this spite of yours is definitely for the destruction of all the demons. [3-51-24]

Shlok 25: "As one thirsteth drinketh water, you drinketh venomous drink along with your friends, relatives, ministers, 
armies, and with your accomplices, as this abduction of Seetha itself is squirrelling away dangerous 
poison. [3-51-25]

Shlok 26: "As with the mindless adventurers quickly getting ruination for they undertake self-ruinous exploits, 
unknowing the backlashes thereof, so also you too will ruin that quickly with this mindless adventure. 
[3-51-26]

Shlok 27: "You are tethered for termination with the lasso of the Terminator, as with a fish that can go nowhere 
on its biting fishhook with a piece of flesh. How do you untether yourself from that lasso of the Terminator, 
even if you go anywhere? [3-51-27]

[Commentary] Vividly: The Terminator gives a sinner a longest rope possible to hang himself from a tallest tree. 
Perchance there may be fish that bites the bait, stripping fishhook from fish line, dives deep down 
to escape from the fisherman, and yet it cannot survive even there, because the fishhook is already 
in its throat, which the fish can neither vomit nor swallow. Thus, it is destined to die. Likewise, 
you bit the baited hook called Seetha and running away with that bait and hook around your neck, thereby 
the Terminator has already lassoed His noose around your neck, and perchance you may presently abscond 
from this hermitage, but not from that noose, called Rama's arrow, for a long time.

Shlok 28: "But, oh Ravana, the unassailable Raghava-s of Kakutstha dynasty will nevermore condone your assailing 
this hermitage. [3-51-28]

Shlok 29: "Like a dastard you are committing a crime of thieving Seetha when none at home in the footsteps of 
thieves, this thieving is contemptible to society and condemnable by valiant ones. [3-51-29]

Shlok 23: "Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right 
away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. 
[3-50-23]

[Commentary] This verse is a repeat of verse at 3-50-23, and such iterations are not for want of paucity of verses 
or verbiage, but they are reckoned as the determination of the character to express his/her stance in 
similar terms.

Shlok 31: "A person undertakes such an unrighteous and fateful activity if only death looms large on him. You 
too have undertaken this unrighteous fateful activity only for your self-ruination. [3-51-31]

Shlok 32: "If sin is consequential to any given activity who will undertake it? Even if that person vies with 
the Self-Born God and Lord of the Universe, namely Brahma, will he undertake it?" Thus Jataayu advised 
Ravana. [3-51-32]

Shlok 33: Even on speaking those commonsensical words to Ravana, Jataayu found him carrying off Seetha heedlessly, 
then that valorous Jataayu descended on the hind-side of that Decahedral demon Ravana, devastatingly. 
[3-51-33]

Shlok 34: On clasping Ravana with incisive claws Jataayu lacerated deeply and rampantly, as a mahout, an elephant-trainer-controller, 
sitting astride on it will try to control an uncontrollable elephant that is running amok with an incisive 
goad. [3-51-34]

Shlok 35: Weaponed only with his claws, wings, and beak, Jataayu not only tore the back of Ravana asunder applying 
his beak and claws, but started to tweeze even his hair. [3-51-35]

Shlok 36: His lips becoming intolerantly quivery when Ravana is exasperated by that king of eagles repetitiously, 
that demon staggered on to his right targeting the hovering eagle at his hind-side to fell it down. 
[3-51-36]

Shlok 37: Ravana who is aggrieved and convulsed in fury hit back Jataayu with his palm while firmly clutching 
Vaidehi onto his left flank. [3-51-37]

Shlok 38: Jataayu, the lord of birds, being a vanquisher of enemies outstripped Ravana and ripped off ten left-arms 
of Ravana with his beak, with which left arms Ravana is clutching Vaidehi, in order to release her from 
his clutches. [3-51-38]

Shlok 39: Though his arms are mutilated thus, they instantaneously ricocheted from his body like snakes possessing 
a series of venomous blazes sprawling out from a snake pit. [3-51-39]

Shlok 40: The valorous Decahedron Ravana then threw off Seetha, and out of fury he scuffled with the king of eagles 
with fisticuffs and kicks, by both his feet and fists. [3-51-40]

Shlok 41: Then there chanced an encounter for some time between those two valorous ones with mutually outweighing 
capabilities, namely the chieftain of demons and the chief of the birds. [3-51-41]

Shlok 42: Ravana brandishing his sword at Jataayu, who is revolting for the sake of Rama, hewed off both of his 
wings, sides, and feet. [3-51-42]

Shlok 43: When that demon of cruel actions has ruptured his wings that colossal eagle Jataayu immediately fell 
down to earth with a lessened life. [3-51-43]

Shlok 44: On seeing Jataayu fallen on earth and dampened with blood Vaidehi fell into a fit of weeping and ran 
towards him as if he is her own relative. [3-51-44]

Shlok 45: Ravana, the monarch of Lanka, gazed at that worthily valorous Jataayu, who in his shine is like a blue-black 
cloud with a whitely white chest and who by now is like a quiescent fire-storm flattened onto ground. 
[3-51-45]

[Commentary] The cloudy blackness is simile to the black feathers of the eagle, and to the charred material by a 
wildfire. The whitely white colour is to the whitish feathers on the chest of the eagle, and to the 
white ashes overlaid on the charred material by wildfire, before they ashen. Thus, Jataayu fell down 
in a supine posture.

Shlok 46: But then Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, whose face vies with moonshine hugged eagle Jataayu, whom Ravana 
has subjugated with his forcefulness and felled down onto the surface of earth, and she wept over incessantly. 
[3-51-46]

[Commentary] Seetha is hugging Jataayu. 'Is it admissible or not...' is another debatable issue. 'Because it is bird, 
it may be handled...' is one adjustment, while the other is, 'when Jataayu is a personified entity and 
a friend of Dasharatha, this bird is as good as a man. So, Seetha's touching him shall be a taboo...' 
The commentators deal this aspect in the next chapter of this canto.

[Commentary] The character of Jataayu is not introduced just to give information 
to Rama at the time of his physical death. He is an example of self-duteous, self-dedicated, unpaid 
servant to his master. In Ch.14 of this Aranya canto when Jataayu firstly met Rama he says:
so aham 
vaasa sahaayaH te bhaviShyaami yadi icChasi | idam durgam hi kaantaaram mR^iga raakShasa sevitam siitaam 
ca taata rakShiShye tvayi yaate salakShmaNe ||"That is what I am, I will be your helpmate 
at your residence, should you wish so, for this forest is one that is impassable and adorned by predators 
and demons...oh boy, I wish to protect Seetha, if you go out of your residence with Lakshmana..." 3-14-34 
And Jataayu kept up his pledge in 'helping Rama and protecting Seetha' as much as he can, without hesitation. 
This selfless service and sermons he rendered to Ravana are exemplary. This is called
daasya bhakti 'devoutness through selfless service...' and service whether 
paid or unpaid is thus to be rendered selflessly - is the lesson he taught.

[Commentary] Secondly, birds hitting airplanes is not a recent phenomenon and 
it existed even before airplanes were invented, as is evident from Jataayu's hitting Ravana's aircraft. 
And Ravana's aircraft that is variously and amazingly portrayed by the sage-poet, is nothing before 
a bird. Hence, Ravana should have used some other latest state of art technology to prevent such bird-hits. 
This is to say, any artificial paraphernalia is nothing before a living organism, and Hanuma, a mere 
monkey, taking lessons from Jataayu, a mere eagle, reduces even the artificially devised Lanka to ashes.



SARGA 52
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha is abducted by Ravana. When they are on their way to Lanka the whole nature along with its inhabitants 
laments for the atrocious abduction of Seetha. In here, almost every verse is elaborated, for they contain 
poetic niceties, and hence more stuffing in introduction is unbefitting.

Shlok 1: Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jataayu whom Ravana nearly 
killed. [3-52-1]

[Commentary] There occurs another verse before this one in Eastern recension which says that Ravana has firstly seen 
Jataayu who is spinning on earth to breath his last:
<>tam alpa 
jiivitam gR^idhram sphurantam raakSha adipa | dadarsha bhuumau patitam samipe raaghava aashramaat ||
thereby giving some time to Seetha to recollect what has happened.

Shlok 2: "Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics 
of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, 
or by cognising calls of birds. [3-52-2]

[Commentary] Vividly: Seetha's plaint is like this: 'Oh, Rama, we humans do perceive good or bad happenings by the 
presages, like concomitant happenings of some hindrances when a deed is attempted, like unforeseen tidings 
like sneezing, a minor accident or a misfire, or unable to catch a sight of one's own face in a mirror... 
or by the undue reflexes of bodily parts, like flutter of eyelids or shudder of shoulders or arms... 
or by the callings of birds and movements of animals... so, by now your left shoulder and left eye should 
have shuddered, or some crows might have cawed uglily, or some birds might have gone from your right 
to left, except garuDa, bharadwaja  birds, and by these forebodings why do not you cognise that something 
is happening to me and thus why not come to my rescue?'

Shlok 3: "Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you, 
even though oh, Kakutstha, these animals and birds are running towards you surely for my sake, to tell 
about me. [3-52-3]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: 'Oh, Rama you may not be able to perceive the prognostications as you are in a fit of 
hunting that Golden Deer, but, for a while keep that hunting at bay and give an ear to these birds and 
animals that are rushing towards you to convey the news of my kidnap... and for god's sake do not kill 
these animals, presuming that they are pestering you...

Shlok 4: "Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jataayu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering 
Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck." Thus Seetha wailed. [3-52-4]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: 'My ill luck is so preponderant, in that it has demolished this Jataayu, who by himself 
is a pious and merited being who came to help the helpless one like me... but my ill luck pervaded over 
such an impeccable being also... otherwise Jataayu would have vanquished Ravana... thus, when an immeasurable 
ill luck is holding sway, it is for you, and you alone, oh, Rama, to come for my rescue...'

Shlok 5: That best lady who is very highly panicked bawled noisily, "oh, Rama of Kakutstha... oh, Lakshmana... 
liberate me now..." as though the addressees are before her. [3-52-5]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: A subject's bawling in the audience of a king is different from that of a cry of a subject 
in a moor. Here Seetha is visualising those two Kakutstha-s, Rama, and Lakshmana, right in her front, 
in a halo, and suppliantly bawling, as though asking them to come out that halo to help her out. Her 
bawling is not in a clamorous tone but it is a roshantiim madhura svaraam 'crying with mellowly voice...' 
as detailed at verse 42 below, for there should be difference between the braying of an ass and parroting 
of a parrot.

Shlok 6: That sovereign of demons, Ravana, rushed towards Vaidehi whose garlands and jewellery are muddled up 
and who is bawling like an orphanized one. [3-52-6]

Shlok 7- 8: Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, 'leave it off, leave it 
off...' when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a 
climber plant, and bawling, 'Rama, Rama,' and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched 
her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. [3-52-7, 8]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: Here the word vane 'in timberland...' is actually 'loneliness...' plus, 'minus Rama...' 
and her crying is araNya rodana 'a cry in wilderness...' And from the viewpoint of Ravana, she is uttering 
a wild cry indicating that 'the giant tree called Ravana is going to fall...' as with the woodcutters' 
yelling 'timber... timber...' as a warning cry that a tree is about to fall, when the word 'timber' 
is used esp. as intransitive. This catching a chaste woman by her hair is the worst possible crime and 
sin as explained at 3-50-13 of this chapter. And now all the gods feel satisfied for the commencement 
of the process for elimination of vice on earth, called Ravana, though pitying Seetha.

[Commentary] Here, the 'capturing Seetha by her shadow' as explained by Maheshvara Tiirtha, is an untouched subject. 
If she can be captured by shadow while she is in her senses and agitating and clinging a sturdy tree, 
as with Simhika-Hanuma in Sundara Kanda, Ravana should not have given her this much time to bemoan, 
but should have captured by her shadow without leaving her to pay a visit to dying Jataayu. Hence, this 
capture is viewed on a human plane, rather than a conjuror's trick.

Shlok 9- 10a: While Vaidehi is insulted thus, entire world together with its mobile or sessile beings became chaotic, 
and there chanced a blanketing of a blinding blackness, and waft-less is the Wind and shine-less is 
the Sun. [3-52-9]

[Commentary] This 'blackness' is a poetic gloominess of the mood, rather than a material or mythical, or superimposing 
darkness. Sun is gloomy, wind is gloomy, and the entire nature is in oblivion of sadness.

Shlok 10b- 11: On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an inappropriate being with His clairvoyant eyes, the illustrious 
Grandparent of Universe Brahma declared, "the deed is done..." but all of the supreme sages in Brahma's 
abode on seeing Seetha in such a condition became despondent, and yet delighted in foreseeing results. 
[3-52-10b, 11a]

[Commentary] Usually this expression parama R^iSaya 'quintessential sages...' is linked with the words
danDakaraNya in next verse and said that 'the sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are delighted 
and yet, despondent...' If some elderly sages were available in the vicinity, they would have waited 
until the arrival of Rama and would have informed Rama of Seetha's abduction, though they may not be 
able to combat Ravana or hurl a curse at Ravana. But Ravana is no fool to abduct Seetha while a bystander 
stands over looking on the spectacle. Hence, these sages said here are those that are available in the 
academy of Brahma. And the danDaraNya vaasinaH in the next foot are the voiceless and incommunicable 
beings in Dandaka forest.

Shlok 12: On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an impropriate being, the dwellers in Dandaka forest cognised that 
Ravana's annihilation has chanced coincidentally. [3-52-12]

[Commentary] Again a poetic 'thinking' that even speechless beings can presage and prognosticate. Though they may 
not tell us directly, their body language and odd behaviour will certainly tell. The behaviour of animals 
and birds before an earthquake or a storm or any natural devastation is not an unknown phenomena. After 
all, a frog crocks before a rain.

Shlok 13: Ravana, the lord of demons, on wresting Seetha who is bawling, "Rama... Rama..." also thus as, "Lakshmana..." 
took flight skyward. [3-52-13]

Shlok 14: That princess Seetha scintillated like the oblique flashes of lightning in a cloud, owing to her golden 
coloured body which is muffled up with jewellery of pure gold, and added with a golden coloured ocherish 
silky dress, while traversing in the sky. [3-52-14]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: A lightening in a cloud does not last for a long period. So also, for being with this 
cloudlike Ravana, these flashes of lightning, called Seetha, will not last long, albeit those flashes 
alone will electrocute that cloud, called Ravana.

Shlok 15: When her ochreish silk sari's upper fringe is upheaved by air onto to Ravana, Ravana looked blazing 
like a mountain set ablaze, muchly and overly. [3-52-15]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: If some parts of a mountain are afire it is no problem since it is usual. But when 
the mountain itself is overly and muchly aflame, it is impracticable for any to prevent it or help it 
out. The upper cloth of Seetha's sari is goldenly silky and thus it will have a tinge of reddish brown 
hue, like the outer edge of the tongue of fire. That fringe pallu is upheaved, [intr.] rise and fall 
rhythmically or spasmodically, by air and it is flagging off the annihilation of Ravana, by its flag-like 
motions on his face. Thus, Ravana who is standing like a mountain as of now is destined soon to become 
a mountain with a self-ruinous fire, overly and muchly.

Shlok 16: Reddish and scented lotus-petals adorning that highly auspicious Seetha have slithered, but again upheaved 
by air they are bestrewn on Ravana. [3-52-16]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: The reddish lotus petals which hitherto are on her body, as garlands and on her braid 
as a chaplet, are crumpled and loosened in the tussle and thus each petal is falling each time. Instead 
of falling onto earth, they are upheaved and sprinkled on Ravana's body by the fast wind under the feet 
of Ravana, somewhat like a floral welcome. This is in one way a good omen to Ravana to get a release 
from his accursed state, while on the other, it suggests that his opulence is soon destined to wither 
away like a withered petal of lotus. The last foot is taken, which obtains in other mms, leaving off 
the middle foot, that also says the same.

Shlok 17: Upper fringe of Seetha's silk sari with golden glitter is upheaved in the sky, and with the reddish 
hue of sun in red heat of midday it beamed forth like a reddish cloud. [3-52-17]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: A reddish cloud is acceptable either in morning or in evening but not in midday since 
it is a bad omen.

Shlok 18: As with a stalk-less lotus the immaculate visage of Seetha is unbright in the sky when she is on the 
flank of Ravana as Rama is not in vicinage. [3-52-18]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: A lotus without a stalk looses its glamour as well as its infrastructure. As sun brightens 
the face of moon, Rama brightens Seetha's visage. As moon depends on sun, Seetha depends on Rama, and 
devoid of him, she is lost to the world for a glimpse.

Shlok 19- 20- 21: Her lotus pistil like un-pimply face is adorned with a pretty forehead on which prettyish curls are 
fluttering, and with teeth that are spick and span and sparkling, but tears dabbed on that face to sideways 
when she wept, yet it is pleasant like moon for a sight with shapely nose, pretty eyes, roseate lips, 
and shining with golden hue in sky. Nevertheless, when she has gone in the flank of Ravana on the sky 
such an immaculate face of Seetha turned like a palish moon that has just risen bursting a bluish cloud. 
[3-52-19, 20, 21]

Shlok 22: Highly disconcerted by the king of demons that auspicious face of Seetha is unbright like the moon arisen 
in daytime with somewhat golden hue, owing to the absence of Rama. [3-52-22]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: One moon is enough. If there were to be two moons, it is indicative of some havoc. Now, 
a silvern moon is there and this lady with her golden-moon face may supersede that silvern moon and 
thus may cause havocs. Moon coming out when sun is still on sky will be somewhat golden in hue. She 
is un-brightened because Rama is not at her side as of now, but like a diamond that is coexistent with 
coal, Seetha is now with this coal-like Ravana.

Shlok 23: She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth 
like a sapphirine gemstone studded in a golden cincture.



She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone 
forth like a golden cincture girded to an elephant. [3-52-23]

[Commentary] The gemstone sapphire, more precisely indra niila maNi, shines brilliantly when studded in 
silver ornaments, rather than in golden ones. Gold is no match to that blue stone. So also, Seetha's 
shine is dullish. This is vyatireka ukti alankaara 'a litotes...' The mms of Govindaraja 
says shushubhe kaa.ncanii kaa.ncii niilam maNim iva aashritaa 'shone like a sapphire with 
gold...' while Maheshvara Tiirtha puts it as gajam iva aashritaa 'a golden cincture like 
elephant's girdle, where Ravana is the elephant and golden cincture is Seetha...' Though this text 
of Tiirtha is found more emphatic, but the blemish of reiteration occurs to the epic, because 
another verse, namely 30 below, contains similar 'elephant-golden-cincture' expression gajam 
kakshyaa iva kaa.ncanii Then, in the text of Maheshvara Tiirtha this verse 30 is pushed to a 
farther place that is at 30. 'Then unblemished it is, insofar as proximate reiteration is 
concerned...' it is said so.

Shlok 24: Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, with a complexion that is goldenly yellowish in the tinge of a lotus, 
moreover with her ornaments of purified gold, flashed like a lightning possessed in a dark-cloud, when 
that stonehearted Ravana possessed her. [3-52-24]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: A lightning seeks no mercy. Though Seetha is overlain on the shoulder of that ghana 
saara hR^idaya 'stonehearted...' Ravana, she does not seek for his mercy to leave her off, as lightning 
overlain on a cloud does not seek the mercy of a ghanaa ghanaH 'a darkly massive cloud...' 
The nearness or the proximity of a lightning and cloud is short-lived, so is this proximity of Seetha 
with Ravana. And the lightning will brighten a darkish cloud, but the darkish cloud cannot darken that 
silvery lightning.

Shlok 25: With the rustles of Vaidehi's jewellery that lord of demons shone forth like a shipshape blue-black 
cloud with rumbles and undulating lightning. [3-52-25]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: A massive darkish cloud may rumble, roar or blare, but its bursting will be scanty 
and short. So also, this Ravana may appear like a thunderous cloud as of now, but it dissipates soon.

Shlok 26: Flowers gracing her best body on her head, in garlands on chest, and on armlets have fallen all-over 
the surface of earth like showers of flowers while she is being abducted. [3-52-26]

Shlok 27: Though that flower-shower has fallen all-over, it is windswept by the speed of Ravana, and fell again 
on that Decahedral demon. [3-52-27]

[Commentary] All the gods have caused the flower-shower, for their mission is going to fructify by this act of
siitaa apaharaNa 'Abduction of Seetha...' saying, 'Oh Goddess Lakshmi, you have graced all 
of us and the earth to allow yourself for abduction... thus triggered off is our mission of elimination 
of vice, in the shape of Ravana, on earth...' So said in kaTaka vyaakhya kaTaka's commentary. 
But Maheshvara Tiirtha says that 'when gods have no guts to affront Ravana or come into the sight of 
Ravana, wherefrom they cause a flower-shower? So, it is not gods that showered these flowers, but they 
are the flowers on her body fallen down by the gust caused by the speed of Ravana, but again windswept, 
up-heaved and fallen on the body of Ravana...' In either the case, Goddess Lakshmi has blessed Ravana 
with the flowers fallen from her physique onto the head of Ravana, as with the flowers slid from an 
idol in a temple, becoming worthy to wear on heads of devotees.

Shlok 28: Like the garland of pristine stars that circles round the loftiest Mt. Meru, that flower-shower circled 
Ravana, the brother of Kubera. [3-52-28]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: This whirling and twirling of flowers around Ravana is not a one time affair. It is 
continued by his dashing speed. When the circling flowers are lowered by gravity, they are again up-heaved 
by Ravana's speed and thus it is recurrent.

Shlok 29: Slid from the left foot of Vaidehi her anklet adorned with gems fell down onto the plane of earth like 
an electric annulus with its sparky sparkles. [3-52-29]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: This anklet has not suddenly fallen. It is whirling for sometime against the gust raised 
by Ravana's rush. When it is circuitously whirling, that ring's sparkles are like the sparks of electricity 
in a circular band. And this ringlet is a symbolic of an electric ring-like guard for the entire earth 
against further atrocities on earth, which is why it exhibited its electric-sparks in sky for a while 
and descended onto earth.

Shlok 30: She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of 
demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, herself becoming a golden girdle girded around the elephant 
like Ravana.



She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of 
demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, as with an elephant, with a golden girdle, stabled in an elephant-stable 
by a mahout, the elephant-trainer. [3-52-30]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: The first gist is the apparent and lexical in its meaning and the second one is like 
this: An elephant that runs amock and berserk will be controlled and brought back to normalcy by a mahout, 
an elephant-trainer. He will use all necessary items like ropes, chains, hurdles etc., to stop its haphazard 
running, and among them is a girdle rope with which he mounts that elephant with his goad to control 
it. Here Seetha is that golden girdle to this elephantine Ravana, with the help that rope Rama, the 
mahout, can control this elephant in rut, namely Ravana, and can place that pachyderm in its elephant-stable. 
Govindaraja.

Shlok 31: Ravana, the brother of Kubera, on invading the sky abducted that radiant Seetha who is radiating the 
sky by her own radiancy like a massive meteor. [3-52-31]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: The sighting of a meteor in itself is a bad omen mahaa utpaata suucitam 'augural of a 
great havoc...' and this Ravana is personally handling such a causer of a great havoc. A meteor, though 
visible as a streak of light falling in yonder sky, becomes incandescent as a result of friction with 
the earth's atmosphere. As such, it is tantamount to a massive fireball. Ravana is carrying this fireball 
to set his home afire. Perhaps Ravana might have thought in similar way and thus kept Seetha in Ashoka 
gardens, instead of placing her in his golden palace, so that his golden palace will not be burnt with 
this torch, called Seetha. But the same torch burns that golden palace down to ashes, though not directly 
but indirectly through Hanuma, in Sundara Kanda, as a coincidence.

Shlok 32: Some of her ornaments which are lustrously flamy, for they are sparkling like the sparkles of fireworks, 
are strewn about on the plane of earth with much clatter like the stars pelted down from the sky. [3-52-32]

Shlok 33: A multi-string pearl pendant, a riviï¿½re, that vies with the moonshine has glissaded from the medial 
of her breasts, and while glissading from sky it is sheeny like River Ganga while she glissaded from 
skies. [3-52-33]

[Commentary] bhaava/import: The simile upama of Seetha's pearly strings of a pendant to River Ganga may 
be observed and the portrayal of ganga avataraNa 'Ganga's descent to earth...' may be referred 
in Bala Kanda. The pearls of the pendant are shining like Ganga's glistening froth and foam, the strings 
are her streams, and the string's wavy movement is Ganga's beautiful flexuous and curvy drift, moreover 
the stings are falling off medially from two mountains, called Seetha's breasts, as Ganga also rose 
and fell from mountainous heights.

Shlok 34: The trees on which diverse birds are perching have been stirred up with the wind blown and up-heaved 
by the gust of Ravana's flight, while the swaying motion of those treetops is as though waving hands 
to console Seetha saying, "fear not... fear not..." [3-52-34]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: When the treetops, rather whole of a tree is swaying, will not the birds abiding on 
it chirp and chitter? Yes! They will. Thus, the birds are twittering and trees are swaying their tops 
for a bon voyage. The chirrups of the birds are abhaya vaakyaaH the 'expression of good wishes 
to a departing traveller...' and the swaying motion of treetops are abhaya hasta abhinaya are 
the 'gesturing with raised and swaying hands wishing good to a departing traveller... etc. minus voicing, 
as with 'ta-ta, cheerio, best of luck...'. The word is 'tree' which comes out of earth and stands on 
earth, thus an earth-born one. Seetha is also an earth-born one and kindred of trees, i.e., nature. 
Nature itself is assuring Seetha to not to fear.

Shlok 35: With wilted lotuses and scared fishes and other beings moving in water the lotus lakes are unenthusiastically 
sorrowing for Maithili as though Seetha is their girlfriend.



The lakes with lotuses as their faces, and fishes as their eyes, and with the other facial adornments 
like the swimming, sweeping and sailing water-moving beings like tortoises, waterfowls and the like 
are unenthused, for a similar girlfriend of theirs, the lotus-faced, fish-eyed, lotus-modelled Seetha 
is beleaguered, and thus they are sorrowing for such a selfsame Maithili. [3-52-35]

Shlok 36: All lions, tigers, animals and birds have then gathered in herds from all-over and ran rancorously and 
pursuantly shadowing the shadow of Seetha. [3-52-36]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: Even the cruellest animals will be compassionate, if only humans are compassionate 
to them. Neither Seetha scared any animal nor any animal scared Seetha. This may be a useful verse for 
Animal Rights Activists.

Shlok 37: The mountains appeared bewailing with their waterfalls as shedding tears and with their peaks as upraised 
arms, while Seetha is thus being abducted. [3-52-37]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo:A mountain cannot fly up to confront Ravana like an eagle, nor it can express its anguish 
like a swaying tree or a chirping bird, nor it cannot doggedly run after like lions and other animals, 
thus it is a 'cannot but situation' for any mountain to sit back and weep, as it is sessile. The eyes 
do not shed tears only in one direction. So also, the waterfalls are shed in many directions at the 
face-level of mountains, but not from their peaks. Then how to express their anguish bodily, to her 
who is up above the sky or pray the Almighty to rescue her? Hence, their raised mountaintops are their 
upraised arms, expressing all of their anguish, more so, with the booming weepy noise of the air coming 
out their caves, which in normal situations will be like the booming voicing of Sama Veda.

Shlok 38: On seeing Vaidehi who is being abducted thus, magnificent Sun in firmament is saddened, and lowly weakened 
is his sunshine, palely whitened is his sun-disc, and faintly deadened is his solar constant. [3-52-38]

Shlok 39- 40a: "When Ravana is abducting none other than the wife of Rama, then there is no probity. At such a juncture, 
how conscience can prevail? Unfounded are candour and compassion," thus the throngs of all beings overly 
regretted. [3-52-39, 40a]

Shlok 40b- 41a: Verily frightened are the fawns of deer, and their saddened faces are with tear shedding eyes with flustered 
looks, and they looked up and up at Seetha in sky and wept. [3-52-40b, 41a]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: The fawns are frightened because they have very broad and comely eyes like Seetha and 
someday some seducer like Ravana may also lead them astray, as collapsed is the equilibrium of conscience, 
candour or compassion. Hence, they are peeking out skyward repeatedly while Seetha is also looking down 
for Rama and Lakshmana, where the commonality is in the fawn-eyes filled with tears, both to the fawns 
and Seetha.

Shlok 41b- 42a: On seeing Seetha who is undergoing anguish in that way the sylvan deities physically shuddered in a 
worst way. [3-52-41b, 42a]

Shlok 42b- 43: She who is looking searchingly at the plane of earth for Rama or Lakshmana, and truly bawling in high-pitched 
but mellowly voice calling "Rama, Lakshmana", and whose hair-lengths are tousled, and whose felicitous 
vermilion mark on her forehead is smudged very untidily, that Decahedral demon abducted such an uncompromising 
husband-devout, Vaidehi, only for his self-ruination. [3-52-42a, 43]

Shlok 44: She who is already detracted from her kinsfolk in Mithila or in Ayodhya, that Maithili with pretty teeth 
and clean-cut smile is then distanced from the only two last kinsmen, for either Raghava or Lakshmana 
or both are unseen by her, and thus her face is paled for she is chastened by the cumber of consternation. 
[3-52-44]

[Commentary] There are many taboos annexed to woman saying that 'a woman is untouchable by other men...' and much 
discussion is also there in Ramayana. For this, the commentator of Dharmaakuutam says, that when Seetha 
herself said to Hanuma that touching other men is indecent in Sundara Kanda, Ch. 37, at verses 60 or 
so: bhartur bhaktim puraskrtya raamaat anyasya vaanara | na aham spraShTum padaa gaatram iccheyam 
vaanarottama || yadaham gaatra samsparsham raavaNasya gataa balaat | aniishaa kim kariShyaami vinaathaa 
vivashaa satii ||  the commentator questions 'how then can she embrace Jataayu, let alone touching?' 
and in answer he says iti hanuumantam prati para puruSha sparshana maatram anucitam iti vakShyasi 
| evam taadR^ishiiyam siitaa para puruSham jataayuSham katham aali~Ngatavati iti cet na | duShTa bhaavena

[Commentary] 'advances towards a woman with a libidinous look, or a voluptuous gesticulation 
or lustful approaches are 'immoral' but mere touching or embracing age-old people, people in anguish 
etc, is as good as fondling her own babies...' Again according to gautama suutraa-s 
'lustful eying, or teasingly hankering after other's women is to be avoided...'

[Commentary] Even the
mitraakshara 'A treatise of Friendlily Advises' says: 'seeing voyeuristically, 
bodily gesticulations, habitual observations, or hankering after lustfully etc., are immoral for a man 
of age at any woman...' This is discussed for the act of Seetha in hugging Jataayu at last verse of 
previous chapter of this Aranya Kanda: punaH ca samgR^ihya ruroda 'again 
taken into hands, wept away...' Some publications of this Gorakhpur version has this word
samgR^ihya a word of less intensity, 'taken into hands...' has a replacement
parishvajya, aali.ngya the words with clear-cut action, 'embraced, hugged 
a dying eagle with a fatherly affection. Therefore it does not mean women are 'untouchables' in general.

[Commentary] From Ravana's side his curse is that, 'his head splinters into 
thousands of pieces if he touches other's woman...' But it is not yet splintered though he handled Seetha 
that roughly. Hence, that curse in its actuality is 'raping' but not mere 'touching' of body parts. 
Touching the 'untouchable' parts of other's women, that too without proper and full consent of that 
woman. As such, though he touched Seetha, carried on his flanks, took to his Lanka on his own body, 
he gives her time to reconcile herself, but does not make haphazard advances unilaterally. Thus, a difference 
between touching and fondling, grasping and caressing is established and it is no sin or taboo for any 
woman to do so.



SARGA 53
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha denounces Ravana's misdeed and challenges him to brave her husband in a manly
combat, rather than thieving her in a mousy way. She reasons with him about his propriety in
abducting other's wives, in vainglory.

Shlok 1: Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, on seeing the skyward flight of Ravana taking her
along became highly frantic and remaining in highest dismay she is distraught. [3-53-1]

Shlok 2: Seetha whose eyes turned coppery-red with tears and resentment, still outpouring
tears while being abducted she piteously poured this scorn on that gory-eyed demon's chief, Ravana.
[3-53-2]

Shlok 3: "You knave Ravana, you are taking flight on thieving me after prowling about my
loneliness, such as you are, are you not ashamed in the least for this subterfuge. [3-53-3]

Shlok 4: "You black-hearted fiend, for sure, you alone sidelined my husband in a trickish
guise of Golden Deer wishful to abduct me as you are a coward. [3-53-4]

Shlok 5: "Which king of eagles battled against you to bail me out, an old friend of my
father-in-law, such as he is he is also felled, indeed. [3-53-5]

[Commentary] Annex: 'You have felled an old and withered eagle after a long-drawn battle...
then, how long can you battle that Raghava? Does this felling of an age-old eagle adds any feather
to your crown?'

Shlok 6: "Ah, truly what an audacious audacity is shown by you... you basely demon... by
ear-shattering your great name saying that 'I am Ravana...' I am conquered in a combat -
Really?



"Am I conquered by you in a combat between my husband and you, wherein you on
announcing your name to my husband and truly showing your audacious audacity defeated my husband,
and thus triumphing over me - or what? Tell me, you mousy demon...



"Unable to conquer my husband in a combat, but able to earbash your name to a lonely
woman and abducting her, will this tantamount to your apparently audacious audacity? Thus, I am not
really triumphed over by a lowly demon like you... [3-53-6]

Shlok 7: "A woman, that too a lonely one, that too the other man's wife, that too an
abduction, but not winning or wooing her... you knave, on your undertaking such a kind of
deplorable deed, how unashamed are you? [3-53-7]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Will not the other males deplore you for your unmasculine female
stealing, for this kind of undertaking is unobserved even in animal world?'

Shlok 8: "A self-glorifier as you are, this highly inhuman, iniquitous, imputable deed of
yours will be recounted by all men in all worlds. [3-53-8]

[Commentary] Annex: 'For this is an unmanly action of yours, all the manly men wish to
recount this as a fabulously fabled account, in dissent, for exemplification of their manliness and
also to retroject your self-vainglory...'

Shlok 9: "Damn with what you have said then about your might and mettle... damn with this
kind of your demeanour which is lamentable to whole of your clan in this world. [3-53-9]

[Commentary] Annex: 'You were boastful of your triumphs and victories at the time of
captivating me, damn with them... since there is not an iota of gallantry in thieving me, a lonely
one in the thick of the forests... and this misdemeanour of yours which not only ruins you but
becomes a lamentable affair to whole of your clan, while being burnt in the infernos of Raghava's
arrows...'

Shlok 10: "What can be done possibly... why because you are fleeing very speedily in this
way... wait for a moment to ascertain whether you can go back in aliveness... [3-53-10]

[Commentary] Annex: 'You are fleeing as though death is haunting you... death is at your
behind... wait, wait and stay... it will approach you speedily... when death nears you, let us
watchfully ascertain whose is glory or whose is vainglory... between your Death similar Raghava and
deadened you...'

Shlok 11: "On your coming into the line of sight of those two princes, even if you are with
whole of your military, you will be incapacitated to live on, indeed even for a moment...
[3-53-11]

Shlok 12: "Anywise it will be incapable of you to endure the touch of their arrows, as with a
bird that cannot endure the overly flaring up wildfire in a forest. [3-53-12]

[Commentary] Annex: 'After all, birds flee by the very touch of fiery air of forest fire even
it is burning distantly... thus, where is the question of your tolerating those infernos, called my
husband's arrows, shot from long, long a distance... and whereby you can stop them from hitting
you, or with what you can retaliate them...'

Shlok 13- 14a: "Oh, Ravana, positively contemplate in your soul and politely release me... and if
you do not release me, indeed by the rancour of insulting me, my husband along with his brother
devises your doom... [3-53-13, 14a]

[Commentary] All women, without exception, have a weapon called prathama kopam 'a
preambular fury...' it is exactly not 'fury' but a sort of bewilderment and insultment meted out by
their indignation. Seetha spewed out a stomachful of ire. Pausing a while, she now started to
sermonise this demon with hita bodha 'moral teaching...' thinking in 'his' shoes and
foreseeing 'his' annihilation. What and why does he care? And how does she bother for his
well-being? These questions have their answers in mythology.

Shlok 14b- 15a: "You rogue! By which endeavour you are desirous of thieving me under duress, that
endeavour of yours behoves absurd. [3-53-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] Seetha's wording should have been 'for lovemaking with me...' instead of
'endeavour' but as an urbane lady, she used a + graamya pada prayoga, 'urbane' language rather than
the graamya bhaaSa 'boorish wording.' Her calculated and cultured talking indicates her staunchness
in her 'husband-devoutness...'

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Though I am in aliveness now, but on my going under the control of an enemy and on
unseeing godlike husband of mine I am indeed unenthused to bear up my lives for a long.
[3-53-15]

[Commentary] Again she may recount her list of 'suicide programs' as related to Lakshmana
after this dialogue. She prefers to use whatever means to end her life, rather than to surrender to
immorality. To indicate this 'character's mood' paatra aucityam  of Seetha, all her opinions about
'somebody's possessing her' were listed when Lakshmana was hastened after Rama, though at the cost
of Lakshmana's steadfastness in his duty.

Shlok 16b- 17a: "Definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either that which is
worthwhile or that which is beneficial to you, as mortals undertake a quirkily behaviour at the
time of their death...



"At the time of their death mortals wish to enjoy noxious and non-recuperative
foods, thus definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either nontoxic or beneficial
nourishments for your well-being. [3-53-16b, 17a]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Bechanced is your death-time hence you behave eccentrically and as a
dying person wants to feast on with disagreeable foods, you also would like to consume a lethal
poison, that is me, and on your death Yama, the Terminator, is ready to offer you a sumptuous feast
with hellish edibles...'

Shlok 17b- 18a: "But which is recuperative that is unpalatable to all of the death-rattlers, and
indeed, I behold you as one around whose throat the noose of Time is looped. [3-53-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "As you are dauntless in this daunting situation as for yourself, oh, Decahedral
demon, indeed it is clear that you are clearly fantasising the ill-omened golden trees all around.
[3-53-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Oh, Ravana, you will see the ghastly River Vaitarani which will be tumultuously
streaming with blood streams, also thus you will see the grisly sword-leaved-forests in hell.
[3-53-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "You will see silk-cotton trees flowered with molten gold, shrouded with lapis
gemlike melting leaves, and enshrouded with sharp irony thorns in hell. [3-53-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] Annex: Then Ravana may retort her by saying 'if such a condition comes, it comes
after my death... but while living I will enjoy you and your company...' for this 'as on date
enjoyment' of Ravana, she is repudiating him with her next statement... 'you have already quaffed
off a venom, called Seetha... dwindled is your lifetime...'

[Commentary] This is a kind of punishment in a section called asi patra vana
'sword-leaved-forest...' in the Hell of Yama, namely naraka. The sinners are asked to hug a
silk-cotton tree like wooden structure with golden leaves and sappharine flowers and irony thorns,
where all these items will be sweltering the sinners besides pinching and piercing with thorns.
This punishment is aimed at those who abduct, molest, or rape the other man's wife.

Shlok 21b- 22a: "Oh, unmerciful one, on doing this kind of misdeed to that noble-souled Rama you are
incapable to bear up life for a long time like the one who quaffed venom. [3-53-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] Then Ravana may say 'nonsense, these venoms, poisons, toxins... all these things
can do nothing to me as I am immortalised, I take you off to a distant place, come what may...' for
that Seetha is saying that 'the lasso of the Time is very long, but its noose is just throat sized
and that noose is already noosed around your throat, called arm-length-sized arrow of Rama, already
shot from his bowstring, called sting-like Seetha, as I am his and only his... as such, inescapable
you are, anywhere you go...'

Shlok 22b- 23a: "You are bound by the unpreventable lasso of the Time, oh, Ravana, on going where
you will get complacency from that uncompromising husband of mine? [3-53-22b, 23a]

[Commentary] Ravana may say: 'is it? What is the proof of his mettle basing on which you
sermonise me?' For this, her reply is in the next verse.

Shlok 23b- 24- 25a: "By whom fourteen thousand demons are killed in war just within a minute,
single-handedly without any help from his brother, how then that brave and mighty Raghava, an
expert in all kinds of missiles, will not eliminate you, the stealer of his chosen wife, with his
mordant arrows?" Thus Seetha poured forth her ire at Ravana. [3-53-23b, 24, 25a]

Shlok 25b: On saying this much and other exacting words, Vaidehi who has gone onto the flank of
Ravana, indeed lamented lamentably as her dismay is coalesced with her distress. [3-53-25b, c]

Shlok 26: She who is highly agonised and weeping before talking, a ranter who ranted much, a
resentful lady who has come of age, and a pitiable whirler in the hands of demon whose whirligig
has transformed into spasmodic jerking of her body for deliverance from that sinner, and in that
way that sinner stole that princess Seetha. [3-53-26]



SARGA 54
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha drops her ornaments at Sugreeva and other monkeys available on a mountaintop
during the course of her abduction. Ravana does not take notice of this as he is hurrying as though
haunted by Rama. On crossing the southerly ocean, his jitteriness in stealing Seetha ceases and he
hypocritically feels elated in gaining both Seetha and an animosity with Rama.

Shlok 1: Vaidehi has not seen any rescuer while she is abducted, but she has seen five
prominent vanara-s staying on a mountaintop. [3-54-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: That broad-eyed and curvaceous lady with resentment Seetha, inwrapping her
auspicious ornaments in the upper-fringe of her sari, dropped in the midmost of those five Vanara-s
with a thinking that 'these creatures may perhaps indicate them to Rama.' [3-54-2, 3a]

[Commentary] Some say that Seetha shore her upper cloth and bundled the ornaments while some
others say that whole of the upper cloth was dropped. The Indian sari
worn by those women of yore was in a different fashion, where they wore sari like the present day dhoti with pleated back
stuffing like men, but they also used an upper cloth enough to cover their busts. A three-piece
dress is a must, either to man or a woman in Indian style. It comprises of a loincloth dhoti or
sari, and a shirt-like or a jacket-like bust cover, and an upper-cloth to hang on the shoulder to
men or to muffle the bust for women. So some say the whole of upper cloth of Seetha is dropped
bundled with ornaments.

Shlok 3b- 4a: On his part that Decahedron Ravana has not noticed her action in whipping up her
silky upper-cloth and ornaments, their bundling and stowing away at five vanara-s, owing to his own
hurry. [3-54-3]

[Commentary] Ravana is in his own hurry because Rama may have heard the wailing of Seetha and
thus may be chasing him, or will chase his shortly. He bothers like this until he crosses the ocean
and enters his city-state Lanka. There he is absolutely secured. Until such time his 'mousy
thievishness' haunts him. But Seetha is on his flank and under his arm, her trunk turned against
his. Then she shortly saw the oddish Vanara-s, who look unlike ordinary monkeys, but with some
presumably pro-human and non-demonic features, yet monkeyish with some regality, and then she
quickly plucked off her ornaments and upcast her upper-cloth, and hastily but carefully, bundled
her jewellery and downcast that bundle at them.

[Commentary] These ornaments are said to be one nosering, one earring, one bracelet, one
biceps-let, one anklet with tinkling bells - all from her right side - because showing
ornaments/items worn on left-side to husband is held improper. The anklet that has fallen from her
leg on earth, in earlier chapters, is from her left leg.

Shlok 4b- 5a: Those ochreish-eyed best Vanara-s with their unwinking eyes have observed the
broad-eyed Seetha, who at that time is verily wailing. [3-54-4b, 5a]

[Commentary] The 'wink-less-ness' is the property of celestials, thus the vanara-s saw with
wink-less eyes with their wide-eyed amazement. Here the Vanara-s are said to be bulishly impetuous
beings and if so, could they not have averted or countered Ravana - will be the question. It is a
regular scene for them to see this skywalker demon to carry off such goddess like ladies and they
have seen many women thus carried off. But this particular one is appearing to be somewhat
different, more over she is repeatedly calling for some 'Rama...' and she is wriggling in that
demon's capture. They know this demon to be Ravana and they even know of the alliance of Ravana
with Vali. If these handfuls of vanara-s dare Ravana, they die at the hands of Ravana instead at
the hand of Vali. Hence, they remained silent spectators to save themselves. This is why Sugreeva
did not indicate the way Seetha in which was abducted by 'some' demon, to Rama, in Kishkindha, when
they firstly met.

Shlok 5b- 6a: The chief of demons Ravana captivating Maithili, who is still wailing, has crossed
the Pampa region down underneath and advanced facing the City of Lanka. [3-54-5b, 6a]

[Commentary] So far Ravana's travel is proceeding with his looking backward, sideward, and
frontward, expecting any attack from anywhere, as this Dandaka or Janasthaana are his frontiers for
operation but not the areas of his stronghold. And when once these areas are crossed reaching
Pampa, there is no more self-confessed fear.

Shlok 6b- 7a: Ravana is jubilantly happy in stealing his own death alias Seetha, as one would
carry a stingingly fanged and lethally venomous she-snake in his own lap. [3-54-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: He bolted out in skyway up above the woodlands, waterways, pools, and mountains at
the double, as with an arrow bolting from a bow. [3-4-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: On reaching the ocean, a housing for sharks, alligators, a home of Rain-god, a
never-draining deep and an ultimate course of the rivers, he hastily crossed it over. [3-54-8b,
9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: That ocean being the abode of Rain-god is highly flustered when Vaidehi is being
abducted over it, and its waves became topsy-turvy and its fishes and great marine-reptiles
remained shilly-shally. [3-54-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Then the siddha-s and caarana-s available in airspace averred saying, "this alone is
the end of Decahedron Ravana." [3-54-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: Ravana entered the city of Lanka transporting Seetha, while she wriggling in his
flank, who appeared like the personified death of Ravana wriggling its way into his Lanka.
[3-54-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, then he entered
his own palace-chambers which is with very many doors and chambers thronging with crowds.



On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, he then entered
his own palace chambers in which royal servants are thronging at many doorways as that palace has
very many chambers. [3-54-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya once kept his
lady-love, a nymphet called Hema, in a demonic Black Hole.



Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya kept his demonic
power in a Black Hole.



Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in
bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya had once kept al his
demonic scriptures duly usurping them from his own mentor, namely Shukracaarya, at an unknown
illusory place. [3-54-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] This verse has some divergences from the viewpoints of commentators.
Govindaraja's text uses maayaam iva striyam while Tilaka uses mayaH maayaam iva
aasuriim thereby the word 'aasurriim...' suggests that Ravana brought a maayaa siita
'an illusory Seetha...' instead of original Seetha, which original Seetha is said to have been in
safe keeping of Ritual-fire until the elimination of Ravana, and comes out of the same Ritual-fire
after the elimination of Ravana. A very big controversy surrounds this statement and whole of the
auxiliary Ramayana-s are brought in, along with puraaNa-s, which substantiate this
riddler, maayaa siita.

[Commentary] As it is, we do not find that much debatable aspect in Valmiki Ramayana, if the
statement that 'Ravana placed Seetha in an unapproachable Black Hole like Lanka, as Maya once
placed Hema in an unapproachable underground Black Hole...' is taken up. This episode of demon
Maya-Hema occurs in Kishkindha, Ch. 51, which may please be referred. Then it suffices to satisfy
the verbiage of aasuriim, when the analogy of 1] Lanka of Ravana and R^iksha
bila, 'Black Hole' of Maya, both being the constructions of artifice, and again between 2]
Maya, the demon and Ravana, the demon, [that too, the eliminable demons,] 3] nymphet Hema and
nymphal Seetha, [the causative factors for elimination,] and the actual eliminators Indra and Rama,
is taken into consideration.

[Commentary] The eyes of Seetha are said to be blackish at their ends. This is not mascara or
something like a makeup article. The eyelashes are longish like those of celestials, so as to give
a blackish orb around her eyeball and because she is now ceaselessly shedding tears, these
eyelashes are tear-wet and slanted edge-ward to give a blackish shade at the end of her eyes.

Shlok 14b- 15a: That Decahedron Ravana also instructed the bogey-sightly bogeywomen, "your watch and
ward shall be in such a way that neither a female nor a male can see Seetha impermissibly."
[3-54-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Whatever she wishes to have, gold, jewels, pearls, apparels or adornments, they all
be given to her as you would give me according to my whimsies. [3-54-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "Whosoever speaks unpleasant words to Vaidehi in the least, either unknowingly or
knowingly, her life becomes unpleasant for herself." Thus Ravana ordered the chamber-demonesses.
[3-54-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: On speaking to those demonesses thus that chief of demons exited from that palace
chamber, and giving a thought to what is to be done in sequel, then he gave audience to eight
highly vigorous demons, the feasters on raw-flesh. [3-54-17b, 18]

Shlok 19: He who is egocentric by the boon awarded by Brahma for his invincibleness, that
Ravana on giving an audience to those eight demons spoke this sentence to them praiseful of their
might and valour. [3-54-19]

Shlok 20: "You immediately take up multiple assaultive weaponry and begone from here to
Janasthaana speedily, a place now deadpanned for demons, which earlier was the placement of Khara.
[3-54-20]

Shlok 21: "Throwaway your fright faraway and you stay in that Janasthaana which fell void as
the demons are voided by someone called Rama, and there you shall stay self-assuredly and
self-confidently. [3-54-21]

[Commentary] Then those eight demons may as, 'when these many leading warriors and commanders
are there why we eight are picked and chosen?' for this Ravana is saying 'you eight are
self-assured and self-confident and can to mete out any assault on our race...' and again they may
hesitate as to 'why we should depend on our own personal strengths...' for that Ravana is saying 'a
still mightier Dushana, still mightiest Khara are eliminated... thus you perk up your sprites,
personally...'

Shlok 22: "Though highly forceful forces are deployed in Janasthaana, Rama's arrows have
utterly destroyed them, together with Khara and Duushana. [3-54-22]

[Commentary] Expecting another enquiry from them as, 'when such mighty, mightier, and
mightiest demons are dead at the hand of a lonely Rama, do you wish us also die in the same way?'
and to them Ravana is saying 'you are the next best in line of order of military, hence it is your
turn to assume command, as committed soldiers, as I am at loggerheads with Rama...' Ravana follows
such 'order of priorities' in warring scrupulously and we chance to meet them in Yuddha Kanda,
canto of Great War.

Shlok 23: "Thereby an unprecedented fury is escalating over and above my courage, and an
unhindered and unforgivable animosity towards that Rama is evoked in me. [3-54-23]

[Commentary] Then the eight commandant demons may say 'what if, let all of us wage a war and
end him up...' for that Ravana is saying suggestively that 'my fury is hovering over my courage...
thus fury alone is scaling up, while courage is scaling down... as I came to know that only one was
warring against fourteen thousand demons and eliminated all... thus we cannot wage large scale war
overtly when our courage is lessening... but we can covertly do some kind of harm... hence, you go
there and undertake any kind of activity that will be harmful to that Rama... as I am uncourageous
and uncomfortable, as of now...'

Shlok 24: "I wish to cast out my begrudging against my enemy who bears a grudge against me,
and indeed, to me 'sleep' is not the word for it, until my enemy is undone in a war. [3-54-24]

[Commentary] By an enforced enmity one's own sleep vanishes as he will always be wakeful of his enemy, for he who 
has purchased enmity is a weakling and worthless to confront... vidura niiti: Maha Bharata, Udyoga 
parve: anena balavad virodhino nidraa na bhaviShyati iti suucitam | tathaa ca udyoge viduraH - ayuktam 
balavataa durbalam hiina saadhanam | hR^ita svam kaaminam coram aavishanti pra jaagaraaH || - dk

Shlok 25: "I for myself will be comfortable only on eliminating him who has eliminated Khara
and Duushana as with a pauper acquiring riches. [3-54-25]

Shlok 26: "While you remain in Janasthaana you have to accurately bring me the information
about Rama's activities and deportment. [3-54-26]

Shlok 27: "Do not go heedlessly, you all night-walkers, for that Rama appears to be too
dangerous, and on your going there heedfully, you have to continually try for the elimination of
that Raghava. [3-54-27]

Shlok 28: "I am aware of your might in battle fronts for a number of times, as such I have
commissioned you all in that Janasthaana." Thus Ravana spoke to those eight demons. [3-54-28]

Shlok 29: Then on picking up those words amiable to all intents and purposes of Ravana, those
eight demons departed from Lanka on hailing Ravana, and they collectively journeyed in the
direction of Janasthaana with their imperceivable appearances. [3-54-29]

Shlok 30: Ravana is then highly gladdened well and truly on gaining over Seetha, and even for
holding sway over that Maithili, and equally for the well-wrought and archly animosity with Rama,
whereby that demon Ravana is hypocritically amused. [3-54-30]

[Commentary] The wording in this verse mohaat mudiataH sa raakshasaH together with the word hR^iSTaH 
raavaNaH at verse 6, is discussed by commentators stating that he is self-conceitedly and hypocritically 
lost in his own hallucinations of possessing Seetha. Tilaka commentary says that bringing Seetha to 
Lanka is a villainous act but not with an iota of reverence to her, when elucidating verse 1 of next 
chapter where it contains: aatmaanam buddhi vaiklbyaat kR^ita kR^ityam amanyata... 'he believed 
in his own self that he achieved a great feat, as his brain gone astray foolishly...' But the poet also 
says proximately that he is amused in gaining an archenemy's animosity, i.e. that of Rama. 
It is therefore said that he is happy as his release from his accursed demon-hood is set to happen soon, 
as he achieved the abduction of Seetha, thus paved way for Rama to come to Lanka to release him from 
his accursed being. This is supported by the statement in verse that Ravana's words have some mahaa 
artham 'words with allusion, or secret message' to Rama perhaps, as at verse 29.

[Commentary] If Lanka is a body, it embodies pleasure seeking traits seated in manas 'pleasuring heart...' 
along with an 'ever witnessing soul...' called saakshi buuta aatma. Along with the release 
of captivated soul, called Seetha, this pleasure seeking manas 'heart' also gets released. 
And the releaser or the deliverer is Rama, and hence Ravana is happy.



SARGA 55
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana entices Seetha to marry him by demonstrating various luxuries and comforts, and even baiting 
her to become his empress. The words of Ravana have some latent meanings as derived by ancient commentators 
and they are included here, as far as possible.

Shlok 1: On directing those eight ghastly demons Ravana is amused in his heart of hearts that he has accomplished 
a great feat. [3-55-1]

Shlok 2: On continually musing upon Vaidehi Ravana is tormented with the arrows of Love-god, thereby to lay eyes 
on Seetha he post-hastily entered the beautiful palace. [3-55-2]

Shlok 3: On entering the palace-chamber that supremo of demons beheld Seetha overwhelmed with ruefulness amongst 
demonesses. [3-55-3]

Shlok 4- 5- 6: She whose visage is brimming over with tears, one browbeaten and downtrodden with the burden of bewail, 
one capsized like a boat that is about to capsize in an ocean spreadeagled with whirlwinds, and one 
alike an impala altogether swerved from its herd of impala yet hemmed in with dog-wolves, that nightwalker 
came nigh of such a Seetha whose face is downcast unwilling to see any, and to such a pitiable Seetha 
who is in the shackles of her sorrow, that supremo of demons compellingly started to show his palace 
which is similar to any paradisiacal palace. [3-55-4, 5, 6]

[Commentary] Then he must have hauled her by her hand or demonesses must have dragged all along the corridors, chambers 
and all over, or as usual, he must have carried her on his flank to show his palace. Taking this situation 
and the statement at verse 1, aatmaanam buddhi vaiklavyaat  Rama Tilaka negates the idea 
that Seetha is brought to Lanka as a much cherished Goddess Lakshmi, but her bringing is only with a 
villainous intent. Even then, the supporters of Ravana - the devotee - disagree. There are many such 
slants given to Ravana's dialogs, to portray him as a devotee, in this chapter itself.

Shlok 7- 8- 9a: That paradisiacal mansion house of Decahedral Ravana is congestive with innumerable cupolaed skyscrapers, 
adored with thousands of females, frequented by diverse bevies of birds, and it comprised of numerous 
gemstones. The pillars are amazingly gilded with engraving of ivory, gilt, quartz, silvern linocuts, 
and they are even embossed with diamonds and with lapis gems, which are heart-pleasing for a look. The 
drumbeats of divine drums are echoing in entire palace, and its archways are adorned with the gildings 
of pure gold. [3-55-7, 8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: Ravana walked up the wonderful golden staircase along with Seetha, and the rows of skyscrapers with 
windows that are ivoried and silvered and with window-blinds are seen from the windows of the landing 
on that flight of stairs, which are also ivoried and silvered windows with window-blinds, and all are 
amusing for sight. [3-55-9b, 10]

[Commentary] Did she walk on her own or was she dragged on the flight of stairs? Yes! She had to walk up the staircase 
after Ravana, but defiantly and straggly.

Shlok 11: That Decahedral Ravana displayed the multiple stories of his own palace which is all over white-marbled 
and diamond encrusted to Maithili. [3-55-11]

Shlok 12: Ravana continued to display the descendible wellsprings and leisure pools from which diverse flowers 
have sprung and overspread them, regardless of Seetha's languishing under her anguish. [3-55-12]

[Commentary] Has she seen all these riches of Ravana? Yes! She had seen, but in disdain and scorn. Refraining and 
desisting from allurement is possible only on seeing the objects of lure. And yielding to such an opulent 
demon or his opulence, just for the sake of carnality, is beyond the scope of Seetha's thinking according 
to her reply to Ravana, in next chapter 'all this affluence is going to be reduced to ashes...' keeping 
Rama in view as the reducing agent, for Hanuma, the actual reducer of this affluence, is yet an unknown 
entity.

Shlok 13: On flaunting his best palace in its entirety to Vaidehi that dirty-minded Ravana spoke this sentence 
to Seetha in order that she may be tempted on her own, lustily. [3-55-13]

Shlok 14- 15a: "Oh, Seetha, ten crores of first-rated demons are there, furthermore, twenty-two crores of demons of 
ghastly exploits are there, thus all put together, three hundred twenty millions of demons are there 
in Lanka, omitting the weakish, oldish, youngish demons. For all of them I am the lord." Thus Ravana 
started his self-eulogy. [3-55-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16: "For every single work of mine a thousand servitors will rush in. Such as I am I pledge entire life 
of mine along with the suzerainty of this sovereign city-state Lanka to you, oh, broad-eyed lady, for 
you are loftier than my lives. [3-55-15b, 16]

Shlok 17: "Oh, Seetha, you will become an empress for all of the those countless females of finest fabric amassed 
by me, oh, dear, if only you marry me. [3-55-17]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: Ravana the devotee is saying: 'oh, Seetha... you become my empress and lord over me 
and all of my wives that are amassed by me... for, You are the most adorable Goddess Lakshmi, and now 
though appearing in a gross form of Seetha, you are the real Subtlety, Goddess Lakshmi... bhaaryaa; 
bhaa= cidruupiNii= oh, Subtlety; aaryaa = oh, adorable one; a+bhava = oh, Redeemer;
priye = most adorable Goddess Lakshmi.'

Shlok 18: "You be keen on my amiable words and it will be apt of you to show compassion on me, for I have burning 
desire for you, and of what use is your thinking conversely about that long-lost Rama? [3-55-18]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: The word kaama is ellipted here as it appears in other mms. Then it is said 
' kaama 'desirous... I have the burning desire of regaining my servitude at your door...' thus
maam bhajasva 'me, you accept accordingly...'

Shlok 19: "It is impossible to assail this Lanka even for Indra with all of the gods and demons, as an ocean roundly 
enshrouds this Lanka which is hundred-yojana-s witdthwise. [3-55-19]

Shlok 20: "I behold none matchable to my vitality is existent among gods; among yaksha-s - no; among gandharva-s 
- no; among sages - no, nor anyone in any world. [3-55-20]

Shlok 21: "What can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant Rama who is short-lived, for after 
all, he is a human with littlest vitality? [3-55-21]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: Ravana, the devotee is saying: 'Why this wasteful lamenting about an un-lamentable 
entity, called Rama, for he is raajya bhraSTa yena 'by whom enemies are dethroned...' raajyaat 
bhrSTaa ripavo yasmaat tena and take this as one word diinenataapasenagataayuSaa by which 
I mean... diina ina taapasa ina gata aayuSaa where ina means 'lord...' thus a lord 
of hapless, a lord for seers, and maanuSeNa gataayuSaa whereby 'for a man who gained longevity...' 
that is ekaa dasha sahasra samvatsara parimita aayuSa yena gataH - praaptaH, saH 'one who has 
achieved eleven thousands years of age in human incarnation...' in which he has to lord over and save 
the saints, sages, seers and such hapless lot...' and alpa tejasaa by which I mean alpam 
itareSaam teejo yasmaat tena 'by whom others' resplendency is dwindled and lessened, just by his 
own resplendence... about such raameNa kim? Why you bother about such Rama, since he is 
parama puruSa the Supreme Person?

Shlok 22: "Oh, Seetha, you apotheosise me only for I am your seemliest husband, oh, jumpy lady, indeed, primeness 
has impermanence, thus here you be blithesome with me. [3-55-22]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: Ravana, the devotee is saying, me yauvanam 'my lifespan...' where the word
yauvana indicates total lifespan from childhood, to young age, to old age... 'Thereby the total 
lifespan of mine is a + dhruvam 'impermanent...' life itself is impermanent... and with elliptic
yataH 'whereby...' aham tava sadR^ishaH 'I am your seemliest... bhartaa; bibharti 
shushruuSa aadinaa svaaminam iti bharta= sevakaH 'a servant...' and with elliptic ataH 
'thereby...' maa bhajava 'me alone, you deify, as un-godly beings cannot be in the service 
of Goddess Lakshmi... take me as your servant...' maameva= maa ava 'me, deliver... accord deliverance...' 
for that you stay here in Lanka maya saha which cleaves like maa= lakshmi, raajya lakshmi 
'with Fortune of Kingdom...' saha 'along with...' ramasva 'you grace us...'

[Commentary] 'Whereby my lifespan is impermanent to adore you, thereby you deify me from this accursed being to be 
in your service constantly... for which I am the seemliest servant of yours... for that you stay in 
Lanka and grace me and this Fortune of Kingdom, till the arrival of Rama, and then accord deliverance 
through Rama...

Shlok 23: "Oh, beautifully visaged lady, it is needless to have half a mind to see that Raghava, oh, Seetha, even 
if his wits chariot him what is his calibre to come thither crossing an un-crossable ocean? [3-55-23]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: Rama is living by his own wits and wisdom to come to Lanka, and his chariot called 
heart, is ambitiously steered by that chariot's horses, called the five senses of Rama, towards Lanka 
alone all through this incarnation. And bechanced is that time and opportunity, thus he has to come 
here, hence oh, Seetha, you needn't worry...

Shlok 24: "It is impossible to knot the currents of cyclonic gusts in mid air, more so, it is impracticable to 
lay hold on the tongues of radiately irradiant fire. [3-55-24]

Shlok 25: "Oh, benefactress of bliss, he who can lead you back with his valour, while you are being fended off 
by my mighty arms, him I do not envisage even in any one world of this threefold world. [3-55-25]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: 'Who can manaH rathaiH api wishfully iha aagantum enter this Lanka, 
and if tried, he becomes a straw in the gale or char in flame... hence tam na pashyaami I don't 
foresee anyone else... raamam vinaa, iti seSaH 'excepting Rama...' ellipted. Thus, Rama is 
scheduled to come here as we have our own dealings, hence maa kR^ithaaH buddhim darshane raamasya 
don't get perturbed at mind in not seeing Rama... he comes soon...'

Shlok 26: "You rule over this very great empire of Lanka as an empress of Lanka, while me and mine, also thus 
all gods like me who hitherto are under my rule, and all mobile and sessile entities of whom I am the 
ruler, they too will hereafter make ourselves useful as your royal stewards, if you marry me. [3-55-26]

[Commentary] From now on Ravana is dedicating whatever he has or acquired to his benefactress, Goddess Lakshmi. By 
saying madvidhaa 'me-like...' it is aatma samarpaNa self-dedication...' lankaayaam 
raajyam anu paalaya 'from Lanka you rule over...' this is aatmiiya samarpaNa 'selfless 
dedication...'

Shlok 27- 28a: "Wet with the waters of anointment you be elated and then delight me. By your damnable dwelling in forests 
bygone is your bad-luck that you misdealt in bygone times. And what dutiable good deed is to be done 
by you in marrying me, you do that now, and secure the fruits of that good deed here by marrying me. 
[3-55-27, 28a]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: 'A damnable demon living in vana vaasena where vana is to betaken 
as waters, 'suchlike me living in an island surrounded by oceanic waters...' mayaa, iti sheSaH 
ellipted 'by me...' puraa yat duSkR^itam karma - kR^itam iti sheSaH 'earlier what sinful act...' 
ellipted 'was done...' tat= duSkarma; tava= mama iSTa devataa darshana maatreNa - gataH 'that 
sin - just by the chance of seeing my choicest deity Goddess Lakshmi - it has gone...' puraa maya 
sukR^ito yo dharmaH 'by which good deed I have done earlier...' tasya phalam 'its good 
results...' te - nivedayaami 'I surrender unto you... tat aapnuhi 'that you kindly 
accept...'

[Commentary] 'As a damnable and islanded demon living amidst water surrounded island, what all the evil-acts done 
by me are evanished just by getting a glimpse of my choicest deity Goddess Lakshmi in you, thus I am 
absolved of all demerits... and any merit, if remnant with me by my performing some good deeds, intentionally 
or unintentionally, I surrender the fruits of all those merits even, unto to you... pray accept...'

Shlok 28b: "Oh, Maithili, here all the garlands are divinely fragranced and the jewellery is topmost, you will 
dress up with them along with me should you become my wife. [3-55-28b]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: A woman is attractable by embellishments and nothing is uncommon about it. A commonplace 
devotee offers just a leaf, or a mere fruit, or at least water to his deity as Bhagavad Gita said:
phalam, puSpam, toyam 'a fruit, a leaf or water is enough to satisfy God...' since a mountainous 
God cannot be appeased with mountainy offerings. But here Ravana, the devotee wants to embellish his 
deity with divinely garlands and topmost jewellery... maya - samarpitaani iti sheSaH 'by me...' 
ellipted: 'offered...' saha= ekadaiva 'at least once...' sevasva 'accept them...' 
'Touch my offerings at least for once... thereby I deem that I am graced by you...'

Shlok 29b- 30a: "Oh, well-waisted lady, just by my might I notched up an aircraft known as Pushpaka from my brother 
Kubera in a war with him, which is similar sun in its shine. [3-55-29b. 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: "That aircraft is expansive and exhilarating, also its speed is on par with intuition, oh, Seetha, in 
that you can cheerfully fly about along with me, should you marry me. [3-55-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: 'That aircraft maya - samarpite - iti sheSaH when I dedicated that aircraft 
to you...' sa artham= sarva sampadbhiH 'with all other riches, besides this aircraft... 
viharasva 'you enjoy...' 'Apart from this aircraft, I denounce all the riches I gained in you... 
you enjoy the fruits of my action and release me...'

Shlok 31b- 32a: "Oh, lady with a comely countenance, your visage is lotus similar in its shine, besides being immaculate, 
fairish and eyeful, but oh, curvaceous lady, with such a mushily maudlin of such a face this palace 
of mine is unbright, thus marry me to brighten everything" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-55-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: While Ravana is speaking to her in this way that graceful lady Seetha veiled her moonier face with fringe 
of her sari, and stiflingly dispelled tears on that mooniest face behind her half-veil. [3-55-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: To her who is disconcerted and whose anguish marred her brilliance and who is appearing as though pondering 
over the question of her submittal to Ravana, or otherwise, although she is meditating, to such a Seetha 
Ravana the nightwalker said these words. [3-55-33b, 34a]

[Commentary] She allowed him to prattle whatever he wished, but when it is aimed at her face, she had to veil it 
customarily to conceal the flood of sobbing tears, aversely. But Ravana, being a leech of lechery, amusedly 
thinks that she is bashful, thus silent, and because silence is 'half-agreeing', thus he furthers his 
leeching.

Shlok 34b- 35a: "Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental 
to scriptural canons, oh, empress, what that is approaching you in the form of queen-hood is absolutely 
compatible with the tradition.



"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental 
to scriptural canons, what that is approaching you in the mode of queen-hood is ordained by gods and 
it is absolutely traditional. [3-55-34b, 35a]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: 'Enough is this embarrassment alam vriidena in the matter of 'served and servant..'
ayam daiva niSSyandaH for this is preordained by gods... aarSaH 'age old, traditional, 
and perennial...' tvaam abhigamiSyati 'the same 'served and servant relation' is now approaching 
you... in this incarnation and nothing new about it, for this is preordained by gods, age old, perennial, 
and traditional, thus enough with your embarrassment... and accept me as your devotee...' Maheshvara 
Tiirtha.

[Commentary] Much is commented on this verse and this verse itself is held controversial as the meaning for niSyandaH 
as 'connection...' is said to be ill defined. Further, some versions use differently as shown above. 
It is said that yet another ancient mms of Ramayana contains the same verse as: alam vriiDena vaidehi 
dharma taapa kR^itena ca | harSho ayam devi vispaShTo yaH tvaam upagamiShyati || where the first 
foot is almost the same and the second foot: harSo ayam devi vispaSTo yaH tvaam upagamiSyati 
which means devi oh, lady yaH harSaH which pleasure you are going to get with your 
queen-hood tvaam upagamiSyati to you approaching in the mode of queen-hood ayam harSaH 
vispaSTaH that pleasure is evident...

[Commentary] 'Oh, Lady, which pleasure you are going to get as a queen, for that queen-hood is fast approaching you, 
that pleasure is evident... why then you presume that marrying me is anti-canonical, and thus be ashamed...' 
so said Ravana with a kind of epicurean philosophy.

[Commentary] A woman who marries twice is called punarbhuH and these are of three kinds. And then there 
is another type called svairiNi. The first category are the women who leave off their first 
husbands and get married to another, thus become the first punarbhuH and the svairiNi 
is the kind of women who will not care customs but follow their own course of alliances. para puurvaaH 
striyaH tvat anyaaH sapta proktaa svayambhuvaa | punarbhuuH trividhaa taasaam tu svairiNii catur vidhaa 
|| naarada Then Ravana is supposed to have argued with Seetha 'you become a punarbhuH 
or choose whatever kind of scriptural statement about the rules of remarriages, but marry me - Govindaraja.

[Commentary] There is another kind of Indian marriage called raakshasa vivaaha loosely: 'demonical marriage...' 
i.e., abducting a girl with her consent and marrying secretly. But this 
way of raakshasa vivaaha 'marriage through abduction...' is admissible only to unmarried girls 
but not to the married women. Hence, the scriptural canons again cannot be satisfied. Therefore Ravana 
is said to have stated all this as an eyewash due to his tamo guNa praadhaanyata 'stupid contrivance 
of scripture with his stolidity of mind...' Maheshvara Tirtha

[Commentary] 'If Ravana is stupid enough to distort scriptures how then can his - devotee-goddess relation - with 
Seetha can be established...' is the question of Rama Tilaka. Thus, it is concluded that Ravana's advances 
are only with a lecherous intent, contrary to what Maheshvara Tiirtha tried to establish Ravana as a 
devotee... Tilaka.

[Commentary] In spite of all these debates and counter-debates of commentators - Ravana remained as a devotee of 
Seetha, namely Goddess Lakshmi, legendarily.

Shlok 35b- 36a: "Let these two feet of yours be massaged by my ten heads, do me favour readily, for I am your subordinate 
and servant. [3-55-35b. 36a]

Shlok 36b- 36c: "I with a lustful hollow-heart spoke all these hollow words that are unbefitting to my stature, indeed, 
Ravana will never supplicate headlong to whosoever woman. [3-55-36b, 36c]

[Commentary] Here the expression shunyaaH is held inconvenient to derive proper meaning and another ancient 
mms is said to have this as: na imaaH shuunyaaH kR^ithaa vaacaH shuSyamaaNena bhaaSitaaH where 
the wordage is shunnyamaanena emptied by lust...' imaaH vaacaH 'these words...'
shuunyaaH 'empty...' na kR^ithaa 'do not make them...' 'Nullified by lust I spoke 
all these words... and you, on taking them as mere nullities, pray, do not nullify my lovelorn words...' 
Tiirtha calls this as rasaabhaasa 'desiring an undesirous woman of others, by hook or by crook.

Shlok 37: That Decahedral Ravana on speaking thus to Maithili, who is the daughter of Janaka, deemed that 'she 
is mine,' as he has gone under the sway of the Terminator. [3-55-37]



SARGA 56
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha reprimands Ravana in saying that her unswerving devotion to Rama will not permit her to be dominated 
by anyone. She gives word-by-word replies to all that is prattled by Ravana in earlier chapter. A discussion 
about Seetha's stance and stability is given in the endnote of this chapter.

Shlok 1: She that Vaidehi who is haggard by anguish boldly spoke to Ravana when he addressed her in that way, 
duly placing a blade of straw in between herself and Ravana. [3-56-1]

[Commentary] The place of conversation is a speckles palace and then where from a blade of straw is available to 
Seetha to place in between them - is the question. It is adjusted by saying that a straw blade stuck 
to her sari, which she removed and placed in between. Has she searched whole of sari, inch by inch, 
for a blade of straw that too to talk to a debased character - is its counter-question. Anyway she treated 
Ravana just as a worthless straw - is another viewpoint. Either way, 'husband-devout' wives do not chat 
with 'the other' males without making an improvised screen in between, may it be a half-veil, a door, 
or any other item that prevent the vilely ogles of others.

[Commentary] She is also said to be talking 'boldly...' where this boldness is the derivative of her self-assured 
'husband-devoutness.' When this boldness is there why she is emaciated through sadness - is the collateral 
question. For this, it is said that her wailing is not for herself, but for her separation from Rama, 
coupled with her thinking about Rama's miseries in forest, besides, due to the ambiguity about Lakshmana's 
meeting with Rama or otherwise.

[Commentary] Tilaka says, 'Seetha is aware of the curse of Ravana that his heads get splintered into pieces if he 
makes advances to any female without her consent, hence Seetha is talking fearlessly. And if Ravana 
tries to make any further advances, Seetha is ready to disappear, as is the practice with gods, or to 
become an untouchable entity, like a hologram...' But this is negated, taking Seetha as a human level 
entity rather than an incarnation, saying that 'human Seetha is unaware of Ravana himself, thus her 
becoming aware of his curse is untenable...' Maybe, Goddess Lakshmi or Maya Seetha is aware of that 
curse of Ravana.

Shlok 2: "He whose son is Raghava, is a resolute king known as Dasharatha. That king is a kingly rampart for 
righteousness, a kingpin abiding in forthrightness and thereby his kingliness is well renowned in all 
worlds, and my husband Rama is such a king's son. [3-56-2]

[Commentary] The word used setu also means a 'bridge' apart from a rampart. Thus Dasharatha is not only 
a rampart 'a defensive wall with a broad top and usu. a stone parapet...' for the defence of dharma 
from its mismanagement, but he is also the bridge between a dharma and dharma. Thus 
this bridge called Dasharatha enables anyone to crossover it towards dharma. That bridge called 
Dasharatha allowed Rama to cross and to reach forests for the annihilation of demons.

[Commentary] Therefore, Seetha is saying 'being such a righteous king's daughter-in-law, I cannot bring blemish to 
my in-laws, or to their dynasty in surrendering to you... furthermore, my husband is the one from such 
a dynasty who never tolerates unrighteousness...'

[Commentary] And by taking the name of Dasharatha, where dasha ratha 'ten way charioteer, or charioteer 
of ten chariots...' she is explaining 'my father-in-law chariots his one chariot in ten ways, whereas 
you can steer only one in one way, called lust... my father-in-law chariots ten chariots in a single 
instance, whereas you can handle only one, at any given time besides being dependent on the capability 
of auto-propelling Pushpaka aircraft, rather than on your own steersman's capability...

Shlok 3: "Such a Dasharatha's son who is virtue-souled one, who is highly renowned in all the three worlds for 
his ambidexterity and perspicacity, and who is known as Rama is my husband and a god to me. [3-56-3]

[Commentary] Annex: 'And he is named as Rama because he causes rejoice in one and all, thus he is well renowned in 
all worlds, unlike you who are named as Ravana, meaning that 'the one who makes one and all rueful...' 
thus you are also well renowned in the worlds, but by your notoriety. On the other hand Rama is virtue-souled, 
unlike you a virtueless, meritless and lawless knave... and his ambidexterity contrasts with your guile-handedness, 
while his perceptiveness with your purblindness of the proximate problem of yours... such a husband's 
wife as I am, how do you think that I on my own get estranged from such a godlike husband of mine, unrighteously...

Shlok 4: "He who took birth in Ikshvaku's dynasty is a great-resplendent one with his shoulders like those of 
a lion, and who comes here along with similarly lion-shouldered and nearly great-resplendent brother 
of his, namely Lakshmana, to take your lives away. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-4]

[Commentary] Annex: Ravana asked Seetha at 3-55-21 'what can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant 
Rama and who is short-lived, for after all, he is a human with littlest vitality?' Thus belittling Rama's 
possessions in the shape of palaces, riches and kingdoms. For that Seetha is now saying that Rama does 
not possess anything, but the whole world is possessed of him. saha lakshmaNa= sa ha lakshmaNa ; 
cihnaa naamno saha lakshmii ke saumitrau saa rasa striyaam 'Supreme Person's possession is the 
eternal opulence of the Universe...' para brahma mantraNayo 'one achievable by constant meditation 
upon Him alone...' To such Rama now adjoined is Lakshmana, the personified prosperity. As such, that 
Supreme Splendour has taken incarnation as Rama because of the curse of Anaranya. Thus, Seetha took 
the name of Ikshvaku dynasty.

[Commentary] The curse of Anaranya: Anaranya is the ancestor of Rama in Ikshvaku dynasty. His son is Haryashva, a 
grandparent of Rama. When Ravana subjugated Anaranya, dying Anaranya curses Ravana to die at the hands 
of his great-grandson Rama in later generations.

[Commentary] 'Such Ikshvaku will now come along with prosperous Lakshmana not only to belittle your opulence of falsity, 
but also to terminate such a vainglorious mischief... thus foxlike creatures like you cannot dare a 
lion, for he is lion-shouldered... and because you foxed Rama you are still alive, otherwise...' - continuation 
with next verse.

Shlok 5: "Had I been forcibly humiliated by you in the presence of Rama, you too would have been killed by Rama 
in combat and by now you too would be sprawling on earth, as with Khara in Janasthaana, but you foxed 
him. However, such Rama is my husband. [3-56-5]

Shlok 6: "Those demons who are spoken of you to be with ghastly forms and gruelling power, they all will become 
formless and powerless in face of Raghava, as with all snakes becoming non-poisonous earthworms in the 
face of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-6]

[Commentary] Annex: 'You said that you have millions and millions of ghastly demons... but where are they, in the 
backyard of your house and behind your back? None has surfaced so far to confront my husband, for they 
are nothing but your kitchenware... and thus you are a gehe shuuraH 'a champion in your own 
home... a paper tiger...' boastful of your paper-thin-tigerish-ness before me, a solitary woman... thus 
you and your forces will be rendered ineffectual the minute you confront my husband...'

Shlok 7: "Those gilded arrows of Rama unloosened directly and unswervingly from his bowstring will utterly batter 
your body, as the waves of River Ganga will be battering that river's riverbanks. Such Rama is my husband. 
[3-56-7]

[Commentary] Annex: 'What if Rama is dethroned or enthroned? He is not a 'hapless' person as observed by you, but 
he solitarily depends upon his self-confidence and a pair of skilful arms

Shlok 8: "Even if you are unkillable either by gods or by demons, you Ravana, you will not be disenthralled by 
Rama while you are alive, for you hatched a very great animosity in him against you. [3-56-8]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Maybe god or demons or others, other than humans, cannot kill you... why the humans were slighted 
by you as your killing agents at the time of your seeking boons from Brahma, or at least at the time 
of my abduction why humans are disregarded... hence, that heedlessness alone becomes the very cause 
for your self-ruination...'

Shlok 9: "That mighty Rama will become the terminator of the vestige of your life, and as with an animal fastened 
to the stake of sacrifice your life too will become irretrievable. [3-56-9]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Even the beasts like cattle and goats when herded towards a slaughterhouse they will be apprehensively 
fearsome and walk closely and snugly, for they know not what will become of them... and for your part, 
your intellect is far too low than that of a beastie bovine... and you say vaingloriously that everything 
in every world fears you... firstly you fear for yourself as an animal tied to a stake...

[Commentary] 'Rama's life itself is yaj~na 'a sacrificial ritual...' his actions are ritualistic performances... 
in which he sacrifices a dharma for the sake of dharma even by sacrificing his own 
comforts... and you said of him as a 'vagrant...' yes, his yaj~na is to be performed not by 
sitting in some hall of ritual, but meandering vagrantly... because entire earth is his hall of ritual... 
and now, you as a sacrificial beast are fastened to the stake of sacrifice by a rope called Seetha, 
and you be ready awaiting for your slaughter in that raama yaj~na

Shlok 10: "If he that Rama glances you with his rancour-torched eyes, you demon, you will be completely burnt 
down now itself, as with Love-god burnt down by Furious Shiva. [3-56-10]

[Commentary] Annex: 'exacting eroticism is an inexcusable impasse... did you not learn this lesson from the legend 
of your iSTa daiva 'most cherished god...' God Shiva, who burnt down the Love-god... and if there is 
any thinly separated state between love and lust, how then will you be unburnt by the furious glances 
of Rama for your lustfulness...

Shlok 11: "He that Rama who hurls down the moon from skies onto earth, or else extirpates it if need be, or even 
desiccates an ocean, he alone rescues Seetha from here. [3-56-11]

[Commentary] Annex: 'You need not sit back gleefully thinking that none can cross over an ocean and come thither, 
presuming that 'a hundred-yojana ocean roundly enshrouds this Lanka...' Rama can dehydrate any ocean 
of any size in its entirety... thus he just walk on its sands in commissioning his mission...

Shlok 12: "Gone is your liveability, gone is your prosperity, gone is your vivacity, and gone is your faculty. 
Thus Lanka is widowed by a single deed of yours. [3-56-12]

[Commentary] Annex: 'as such, you yourself cannot be on the throne of Lanka since her widowhood is admonished by 
your single act of touching 'other man's wife' that is me, and in abducting me... wherewith you daydream 
and daresay to me 'you rule over this very great empire of Lanka as empress of Lanka...'

Shlok 13: "In forest you have separated me from the propinquity of my husband, which diabolic deed of yours will 
not result in any ultimate happiness for you. [3-56-13]

[Commentary] Annex: you said to me, 'of what use is your thinking conversely about that long-lost Rama...' what else 
am I to do, for I am diabolically dragged away from him by you, as such I am, I am now contemplating 
upon that Rama alone to come here to handover 'a fruit of unhappiness' to you as a barter for my release...'

Shlok 14: "In fact, that great-resplendent husband of mine, Rama, is still residing in the eremitical Dandaka 
forest, bravely hinging on to his own valour, in tandem only with my brother-in-law. [3-56-14]

[Commentary] Annex: 'you said that you do not envisage 'him who can lead me back with his valour...' but my husband 
is still there in Dandaka along with his brother, both in tandem only with God Almighty, whose biting 
bravery and venomous valour are yet to be tasted by you... and if you too are brave enough, confront 
him to know whether I am winnable or otherwise...'

Shlok 15: "With storms of his arrows in a given combat my husband will dislodge arrogance, insolence, puissance, 
like that impudence from every limb of yours. [3-56-15]

[Commentary] Annex: 'for yours is only bodily might as you have said 'I behold none matchable to my vitality...' 
and no spiritual or ethical, or whatsoever merits abide in you... thus, should you confront an ethical 
and scrupulous combatant, evanished are your bodily vanities...'

Shlok 16: "As and when ruination of created beings manifests actuated by Time, then all of them will place their 
behaviour in endangerment, as they have gone under the control of End-Time. [3-56-16]

[Commentary] Annex: 'you said to me that 'by your damnable dwelling in forests, bygone is your bad-luck which you 
misdealt in bygone times...' and I agree for that assertion of yours as my damnable bad-luck is nearing 
its completion, but your damnable, ill-lucky, self-ruinous time as started, and hence you are placing 
your behaviour in endangerment, by this quirkish act of abducting me...'

Shlok 17: "This is that time which has bechanced on you owing to your molesting me, you basely demon, by which 
time-factor yourself, all of your demons, and even all of your queens in the Chambers of Queens will 
be devastated. [3-56-17]

[Commentary] Annex: You said that I will become an empress among all females you brought. I need not become an empress 
for the 'countless females of finest fabric you amassed...' Because all those females have yielded themselves 
to you, and they are going to be devastated and evanished along with their Chambers of Queens, which 
chambers you endowed to them as gifts. But Rama will rescue others who are still captivated yet reticent. 
Where is the question of my becoming an empress of dead souls?

Shlok 18: "It is impossible for a profaner to heavily tread on the Altar of Fire amidst a Ritual Hall surrounded 
by oblational vessels, further sanctified by Vedic hymns. [3-56-18]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Liken me to that Altar of Fire, centrally located in the ritual hall of Rama, namely the whole 
earth, and liken the oblational receptacles to nature's bounties like lakes, rivers, mountains, trees, 
and liken the offerings to flowers, fruits, and waters, and liken Vedic sound to the background drone 
of nature... and every bit of it is sanctified by all the hymns of Veda-s, as all Veda-s glorify them, 
the components of nature alone... and you profaner... it is impossible for you tread on this Fire Altar, 
that is me, blasphemously...'

[Commentary] This expression caNDaal has its own impact. Though this is amplified elsewhere it is reiterated 
here also. The nomenclature of caNDaal is not the present day 'untouchable' 'outcaste' or a 
'pariah' etc., because he is also a member and an important functionary in Hindu system of castes. The 
analogy is between the Vedic-scholar and profaner, [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious 
rites or any esoteric knowledge...] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, and between the 
Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar may perhaps conduct a
yaj~na but he is no authority to conduct antya kriya 'funerals' till its end. At best, 
a priest's function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps until kapaala moksha 
'breakage of cranium...' and from then on it is the function of this caNDaal to take care of 
the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since leaving half burnt corpse to vultures 
and foxes or wolves, is sinning. Thus, if a Vedic scholar conducts jaata aadi kriyaaH 'rites 
from birth onwards...' as an initiator, whereas a caNDaal conducts antya, uttara kriyaaH 
'rites of death afterwards...' as a terminator. Thus, Ravana being a Vedic scholar is now conducting 
himself as a self-cremator.

Shlok 19: "Likewise, I am the solemnly pledged legitimate wife of one who steadied himself in righteousness, and 
such as I am, you basely demon, it is impossible for you trespasser to touch me even. [3-56-19]

Shlok 20: "How a she-swan ever frolicking with majestic swans in bunches of lotuses can leer at a water-crow sneaking 
in a bunch of grass? [3-56-20]

Shlok 21- 22a: "Oh, demon, you may either trammel or vandalise this inertial body of mine. I claim neither this body 
nor life of mine as my own. But I am intolerant to bear with any disrepute on this earth." Thus Seetha 
castigated Ravana. [3-56-21, 22a]

[Commentary] Annex: 'my father endowed me to Rama bodily in kanyaa daana 'bride betrothal...' and I soulfully 
resigned my soul, let alone my life, unto that Rama by my vara sviikaara, paaNi grahaNa... 
'marriage...' as such I cannot reclaim my body and soul from Rama for placement in other's unworthy 
hands... thereby it is up Rama to win back his wife, or it is up to you to tangle, mangle, and wrangle 
with these ideas...'

[Commentary] Nobility is nobler than life. Hence, it is to be protected even at the cost of one's own life...

Shlok 22b- 23a: Vaidehi on speaking those highly caustic words angrily to Ravana in this way, she that Maithili spoke 
no more in that matter. [3-56-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: On hearing Seetha's scathing and hair-raising censures, then Ravana retorted with these intimidatory 
chides. [3-56-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25: "Oh, angry lady Maithili, listen to my words. A period of twelve months is given to you. And oh, smiley 
smiler, if you do not come nigh of me within that period, then the cooks will slice you to pieces for 
the purpose of a morning meal." [3-56-24b, 25]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: Ravana the devotee is saying: 'I will wait for a period of twelve months... and if 
I am na abhyeSi 'unblessed...' tataH tvaam uddishya 'then, on your account...' 
praataH 'morning, next morning after twelve month period...' aashaa artham 'for the purpose 
of crows, eagles and vultures in direction, quarters...' suudaaH 'cooks...' maam Chesyanti 
'me, they slice to pieces...' mat aaj~nayaa, iti shesaH 'by my order, thus ellipted...'

[Commentary] 'I will wait for a period of twelve months... and if I am unblessed even by that time, by my order my 
cooks will slice me to pieces for the morning meal of vultures in all the directions of compass, as 
a kind of self-immolation by getting sliced to pieces as I will become unworthy for your grace...' Tiirtha.

[Commentary] If one king conquers another and lay seize to queens, a twelve month time is given to the defeated king 
to regain his captivated queens, by making another round of combat. If the defeated king is unable to 
do so, or reluctant to do so, the captivated queens of the defeated king automatically belong to the 
conquering king after twelve months, raja niita - shaanti parva - Maha Bharata.

Shlok 26: Thus on saying those harsh words, Ravana, the one who makes his enemies to bewail, and who is now infuriated 
said this sentence to the guarding demonesses. [3-56-26]

Shlok 27: "Oh, gnarled demonesses of grisly mien and devourers of meat and blood, you have to indeed remove her 
pride immediately. [3-56-27]

[Commentary] dhvani/innuendo: 'Oh, demonesses you now immediately become a+ vikR^itaa 'not, ghastly, not 
gnarled...' darpam vinaa 'your pride, without...' asyaat samiipe 'in her proximity, 
in her audience...' iSyadhvam 'be servitors...'

[Commentary] 'Oh, demonesses of gnarled grisly mien and devourers of meat and blood, now you immediately become presentable, 
casting off your gnarled and ghastly appearances... and without your personal pride be in her servitude 
as servitors in her audience... for she is my Goddess Lakshmi...'

Shlok 28: Just by that order of Ravana those demonesses of grotesque and ugly appearance have obediently made 
palm-fold to him and encircled Maithili. [3-56-28]

Shlok 29: That king Ravana paced in an earth-shattering manner as though to cleave it and clearly said this to 
those demonesses with ghastly look. [3-56-29]

Shlok 30: "Let this Maithili be taken to the centre of Ashoka gardens, where you all shall blockade and guard 
her stealthily. [3-56-30]

Shlok 31: "You threaten her with dreadful admonitions and again speaking imploringly you all have to bring her 
under control, as a wild she-elephant of age will be brought under control. [3-56-31]

[Commentary] Annex: Ravana the devotee's the caution is: vinaa tarjaniaH 'without threats, tame her; or
tarjanaiH vinaa ghoraiH where vinaa 'without...' is ellipted by commentators and said 
'threats without dreadfulness...

[Commentary] 'You as demons are already habituated to threat sages and saints till their death... but, mind it... 
just threaten Maithili till threat-tolerability... do not overdo it, lest she may die of threats... 
again brainwash her with good words of me and my generosity... if Maithili is dead at your hands deem 
that you and your families are effaced... for I cherish Maithili to live...'

Shlok 32- 33: When Ravana has clearly ordered, those demonesses on their part took Maithili to Ashoka garden. That 
Ashoka gardens are surrounded with trees that yield fruits to every savour, and now they are diversely 
flowered and fruited. Further, those gardens are highly adored by all-time lusty birds. [3-56-32, 33]

Shlok 34: But she that Janaka's daughter Maithili whose body is with a coverall of anguish, further on obtaining 
the control of demonesses, she is as good as a she-deer under the coverall of tigresses. [3-56-34]

Shlok 35: Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, who is already consumed by utmost agony has not obtained any placidity 
now as with a she-deer bound by tether - where timorousness is common to both. [3-56-35]

Shlok 36: Maithili knows no peace when the bizarre-eyed demonesses have highly intimidated her, and by shut-seeing 
those demonesses her reminiscences went over to her dear husband and about her brother-in-law Lakshmana 
too, and when she felt about the improbability of their coming here, she is distraught with alarm and 
anguish, and then she swooned. [3-56-36]

[Commentary] Is Seetha really the Goddess Lakshmi? This question 
is often raised and answered by commentators. Ravana kidnapped umpteen numbers of beautiful women and 
goddess, but why his dialogues with Seetha are given many shades of meanings by all most all commentators. 
Is this for proving Ravana as devotee or else to prove that Seetha is not a human but Goddess Lakshmi 
- is the collateral objection. Apparently, Seetha is behaving like a normal woman but latently her speeches, 
verbiage, or the words put by Valmiki on her tongue, indicate that she is an all-powerful enigma... 
without saying who she is.

[Commentary] If she is an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi how 
then can Ravana lift her up and carry this far - is the next dilemma, because Ravana's strength becomes 
useless to lift up Lakshmana who swooned on the battlefield when Ravana used Shakti missile. In Yuddha 
Kaanda Ch. 59 verse 111 it is said: himavaan 
mandaro meroH trai lokyam vaa saha amaraiH | shakyam bhujaabhyaam uddhartum na shakyo bharata anujaH

[Commentary] 'Ravana may have lifted Mt. Himavan, 
Mt. Mandara, Mt. Meru or all the three worlds along with all gods, but he could not lift up Bharata's 
brother Lakshmana with both of his shoulders...'

[Commentary] Ravana wanted to distance fiercer Lakshmana from 
Rama so that Rama's intensity of warring lessens. Then an episode of this lifting occurs and Hanuma 
on seeing this comes to Ravana and hits Ravana with fist, by which Ravana falls distantly with blood 
effusing from eyes, ears, and mouth. Then Hanuma easily lifts up Lakshmana and takes him to Rama. A 
man in swoon will not weigh differently to two different lifters. How then Ravana could not lift Lakshmana, 
which is not at all a great feat to Hanuma? For this the very next verse 112 gives a reply saying that:

[Commentary] 'even if Lakshmana is hit by Shakti 
missile of Brahma, he is conscious of himself as an unimaginable entity of God Vishnu, so Ravana could 
not lift Lakshmana. Whereas Hanuma happened to be a true devotee of God Almighty, he could easily lift 
Lakshmana...'

[Commentary] Then the original topic of Ravana's lifting and 
carrying off Seetha comes to fore. She is also another unimaginable entity of Supreme Person. How then 
can Ravana lift her? For this it is said that Seetha allowed herself to be carried off by Ravana as 
she pledged in the incarnation of Vedavati.

[Commentary] The legend goes on to say that Vedavati is the 
brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati only to Vishnu in marriage. 
But it is an unfulfilled desire in his lifetime. Then Vedavati starts a rigorous penance to achieve 
her father's wish. When she is at the culmination point of her penance, Ravana passing that way in skyway 
sees this beautiful lady, nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation curses 
Ravana saying that she will reincarnate herself to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. Then she causes 
a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. Ravana took this as prattle by a woman-hermit, dismisses that 
curse, and conveniently forgets it.

[Commentary] Later, Ravana being an ardent devotee of Shiva, 
on one day when he enters a lake to get lotuses for his daily worship of Shiva, and finds among lotuses 
a baby in a lotus. He brings that lotus and the baby to his palace, in all his fondness for children. 
But his empress Mandodari doubts the arrival of this baby in lotus and recognises that baby as Goddess 
Lakshmi. They consult their teachers about that baby's arrival. Those teachers, priests and pundits 
advise to get rid of this baby immediately, for she is Vedavati, arrived here only to end Ravana and 
his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders the servants to carry away this baby in a casket, and bury it.

[Commentary] Empress Mandodari further curses that girl saying: 
'this faithless girl [for Wealth has no faithfulness, and this girl is recognised as Goddess Lakshmi 
- presiding deity of Wealth,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses conquered, 
and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though wealthy and supreme by himself, 
will care nothing for the riches but view whole of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial 
attitude...' Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal world, 
and thus presumed this curse to be twisty. But there is King Janaka who has all these attributes. A 
king without ego, wealthy one living simple, childless but yet does not crave for children, like King 
Dasharatha. Hence, he is called raajarshi a saintly king. While King Janaka 
was about to perform a Vedic ritual, he had to till some piece of land as a ceremonial act to commence 
that ritual. Then this casket with the baby is touched to the blade at the end of plough-beam and that 
plough halted. The attendants dug up that area only to find this casket with baby. The childless Janaka 
takes the baby into his arms and names her as 'Seetha...' where Seetha in Sanskrit means 'furrow.' This 
is as per aananda raamaayaNa Thus, Goddess Lakshmi became Vedavati and 
Vedavati became Seetha of Ramayana, as such Valmiki calls his Ramayana siithaayaH 
charitam mahaan...

[Commentary] Then another counter objection - it is all correct 
to say that all puraaNaa-s say that these characters in Ramayana as gods 
and goddesses, as Vishnu Puraana says raaghavatve havat siitaa rukmiNii kR^iSNa 
jananii. But does Valmiki say it in his epic? For this it is answered, though it is not said 
explicitly there are many instances indicating towards this divinity of Seetha. Seetha asks Fire-god 
to become cool for Hanuma, when his tail is burnt saying siito bhava hanumataa 
and likewise she could have said hato bhava raavaNa 'dead you are Ravana...' 
But she does not say so for, because Rama has to undertake that process of elimination of vice called 
Ravana. As Seetha said in Sundara Kanda Ch. 22, verse 20:
a sandeshaat 
tu raamasya tapasaH ca anupaalanaat | na tvaam kurmi dashagriiva bhasma bhasmaarha tejasaa ||

[Commentary] 'As I have no indication from 
Rama to burn you down, nor do I wish to waste my ascetic power, therefore I do not burn you to ashes, 
though you are worthy to become a mound of ash...'na apahartum aham shkyaa tvayaa raamasya dhiimataH | vidhiH tava vadha arthaaya vihito na atra samshayaH ||

[Commentary] 'I am un-seizable for [any] as 
I am the wife of bold Rama, but it happened so, for you are fated to doom [you could seize me...] undoubtedly...'

[Commentary] Again in 
Yuddha Kanda Brahma in eulogising Rama for eliminating Ravana says in Ch. 117, verse 28:
siitaa lakshmiiH bhavaan viSNuH... 'Seetha is Lakshmi and you are Vishnu...' 
Like this, there are many bits and pieces of information to establish her as an incarnate of Vedavati 
alias Goddess Lakshmi. Govindaraja.

[Commentary] Then why she and Rama behaved 
like humans in their wailing, moaning, and bawling is again a secondary query. This is according to
loka riiti, laukika vidhaana 'humanly nature, behaviour in human world...' 
Though this humanly behaviour is not innate trait as Rama says aatmaanam aham 
maanuSam manye 'I for myself confess to be human...' Hence this humanly wailing and bawling are 
due to an adopted human behaviour, where incarnation itself is an adaptation.

[Commentary] Their humanly behaviour 
is to show themselves as one with the humans, asking humans to undergo these series of sufferings to 
eliminate unrighteousness, either in the society or within themselves. Besides, their mission is to 
make believe Ravana that they are just humans, as Ravana is killable by humans and monkeys, but not 
to hoodwink readers, the adherents or all of us put together. Maheshvara Tiirtha.

[Commentary] This incarceration of Seetha 
in Ashoka gardens is viewed as the incarceration of the innate soul in birthed being's body. The release 
from that body, namely moksha is achievable only when that being wants 
a perfect release by transcending the threefold nature consisting of sattva, rajas, 
tamo guNaaH 'purity, activity and stolidity...' and with an unswerving devotion to the Supreme 
as said in Gita, 14-26: maam 
ca yo avyabhicaareNa bhakti yogena sevate | sa guNaan samatiitya etaan brahma bhuuya kalpate ||

[Commentary] 'And such- / With single, fervent faith adoring 
Me, / Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms / To Brahma, and attains Me!' - Sir Edwin Arnold.

[Commentary] God Almighty is said to 
be masculine single, the rest of the universe is taken as feminine, as said in Vishnu Puraana:
sa eva vaasudevo ayam saakShaat puruSha ucyate | strii praayam etat sarvam jagat brahma purassaram || 
Then the way the innate soul, called Seetha, is incarcerated is, when she had no help of the Supreme 
or the Adherent of the Supreme, [Rama and Lakshmana.] Then the Decahedral demon [the demon called Ten 
Motor Senses,] came and captured the Soul, called Seetha and incarcerated that soul in Lanka. The syllable 
'lam' in the word Lanka is lam - biijaakshara which stands for earth, and 
because body is earthly, lascivious and carnal, the soul enters that body by its bondage. If that soul 
again tries for a final release, that soul shall seek the Ultimate as said in the verse of Gita, quoted 
above.

[Commentary] There is no instance to quote that Rama or Seetha have performed 
some miracles, special effects or any other optical works... perhaps due to lack of any FX studio or 
something like that, or due to their humanly behaviour. This wizardry is shown by demons and monkeys 
but not by mannish Rama or womanish Seetha. Yet Seetha is held more enigmatic than Rama. If she is not 
an enigma how she footslogged miles and miles in forests without hiring a taxi, and how she came out 
of blazing fire when she performed self-immolation after Great War? These are but two questions among 
many. Because these questions are never-ending and more enigmatic, because we think that we have deciphered 
what Rama is, it is better retain Seetha as an undecipherable enigma.



SARGA 57
------------------------------

[Text] Rama meets Lakshmana while returning to hermitage after killing the deer demon Maareecha. He also confronts 
some ill omens and worries why Lakshmana left Seetha alone and came to him, sad facedly.

Shlok 1: Rama on killing that demon Maareecha, who is a guise changer at his wish and who moved about in the 
guise of a deer, instantly started to return on the trail by which he trailed after that deer-demon. 
[3-57-1]

Shlok 2: While Rama is anxiously hurrying to see Maithili, then a brutish voiced jackal deafeningly howled at 
his behind. [3-57-2]

Shlok 3: On hearing that threatening and hair-raising howl of jackal Rama is overly threatened just by the tone 
of fox in which it is foreboding, inasmuch as the forbidding intoning of Maareecha. [3-57-3]

Shlok 4: "Huh! As to how this jackal has howled I deem that as inauspicious. As yet undevoured by demons would 
Vaidehi be safe? [3-57-4]

Shlok 5- 6: "On knowing the nature of my voice Maareecha in the semblance of a deer yelled out mimicking my voice. 
If Lakshmana listens that voice, recognising it as my voice he will instantly rush to my near. Else 
if Maithili listens, she will hasten him to go over here and Soumitri instantly rushes here leaving 
her off. [3-57-5, 6]

Shlok 7- 8: "As could be seen from Maareecha's becoming a Golden Deer only to sidetrack and take me away from hermitage, 
his becoming a demon when hit with an arrow, and his shouting words indeed like, 'ha, Lakshmana, ha, 
Seetha, I am killed,' the demons are collectively intending to do away with Seetha. It is certain. [3-57-7, 
8]

Shlok 9- 10a: "Whether there will be safety in forest for those two in my absence, or not, is my doubt. Owing to my 
devastating Janasthaana I have become a harboured grudge for demons, am not I! As such, foretokens are 
appearing now, severely and severally." Thus Rama's thoughts have sprinted. [3-57-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: When that soulful Rama has heard the whistle of jackal while returning, he persistently thought in this 
way about his detour caused by demon in the disguise of a deer, thus he speedily advanced towards his 
hermitage. [3-57-10b, 11]

Shlok 12: Raghava came to Janasthaana doubting overly, and the animals and birds of Janasthaana which look doleful 
have neared him whose heart has become doleful. [3-57-12]

Shlok 13: Those doleful animals and birds moving in circumambulations from the left side to right of that noble-souled 
Rama they let off frightening shrieks, and then observing those highly forbidding foretokens Rama returned 
to his own hermitage hastily and hurriedly. [3-57-13]

[Commentary] It is ill-omened if the animals or birds move round from one's left to right side.

Shlok 14- 15a: Then Rama saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a lacklustre face, and then Lakshmana, who is melancholic 
and anguishing in his divergence from Seetha, met Rama not a long-way-off, where Rama is a similar partaker 
in melancholy and anguishing by way of his convergence upon ill-omens. [3-57-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: On seeing Lakshmana who has arrived at this place leaving off Seetha in a forest that is desolate, more 
so an adorable forest for demons, Rama reproached him as his elder brother. [3-57-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Taking Lakshmana's left hand into his, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, alike a bewailer spoke this brusque 
speech that has a mellowly fruition in future. [3-57-16b, 17a]

[Commentary] This statement obtains two shades of meaning. One, the speech of Rama in reproaching Lakshmana though 
appear to be brusque, latently it is congratulatory to Lakshmana, to make happen the abduction of Seetha 
firstly, and thereby the ultimate elimination of Ravana. Two, he scolded Lakshmana prima facie for leaving 
Seetha, but on realising that he is not at fault, his speech is softened.

Shlok 17b- 18a: "You have done a deplorable deed in coming here forsaking Seetha. Now, oh, gentle Lakshmana, are we 
somewhat safe, or everything has already gone astray now itself, or what. [3-57-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: "Oh, brave one, according to these many inauspicious forebodings that have manifested themselves to 
me, we might have lost Janaka's daughter Seetha, or the forest ranging demons might have devoured her, 
or else they might have kidnapped her, I am doubtless about it. [3-57-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: "Oh, tigerly-man Lakshmana, I wonder whether we can at least make out the daughter of Janaka Seetha 
in her intactness and aliveness. [3-57-20]

Shlok 21: "On observing these mobs of deer, this jackal, also even these birds which are voicing noisily facing 
the direction lit by the sun, oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, can we presume that there will be safety to 
that princes Seetha? [3-57-21]

Shlok 22: "This very demon in his likeness to a deer led me on and led me off distantly as I was indeed following 
him, and by an intense effort somehow he was killed, and when dying he transfigured into a demon. [3-57-22]

Shlok 23: "Now even my heart is woeful and I am woebegone, my left eye is also fluttering erratically, oh, Lakshmana, 
no doubt Seetha is not there in hermitage, maybe she is whisked away, or, wiped out, or, wandering around 
on a wrong way. [3-57-23]

[Text] Rama is anguished for Seetha's aloneness and it is expressed in his chastening Lakshmana. Rama asks 
him as to why he left Seetha unguarded in the lonely forest. Rama rushes rapidly to hermitage thinking 
and talking that rapidly to Lakshmana about Seetha, and on arriving he finds vacuity in hermitage and 
then he is thrown in throes of despair.

Shlok 1: On seeing dreary Lakshmana coming into the void of forest devoid of Vaidehi, then the virtue-souled 
Rama, the son of Dasharatha, has asked him impatiently. [3-58-1]

Shlok 2: "She who has come in tow with me to Dandaka forest when I started for peregrination, whom you have now 
deserted and came here, oh, Lakshmana, she that Vaidehi, where is she? [3-58-2]

Shlok 3: "When I have become forlorn with the forfeiture of my kingdom and when I was rushing for Dandaka forest 
she stood with me as a partaker in my woes. She that comely Vaidehi, where is she? [3-58-3]

Shlok 4: "Without whom I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, valiant one, such a Seetha who in simile 
is like the daughter of deities and who is my life-force, where is she? [3-58-4]

Shlok 5: "I am unambitious for the rulership either on heavens or on the earth, oh, Lakshmana, without the daughter 
of Janaka whose aspect glisters like gold. [3-58-5]

Shlok 6: "Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my lives, will she be alive somehow! Oh, valiant Lakshmana, this peregrination 
of mine, will it not become futile, someway! [3-58-6]

[Commentary] Annex: I neither can live devoid of Seetha, nor can complete the pledge of fourteen-year period of forest 
trek for ultimate annihilation of Ravana. If Seetha is dead I am also dead. Then I have live to fulfil 
the pledge. But when I am dead I will become a killer of my own pledge than my own body. If Seetha is 
no more what happens to her abduction, Ravana's elimination, and my pledge to gods and my incarnation...

Shlok 7: "When I am dead for the sake of Seetha and when you get back to Ayodhya lonesomely, and when Kaikeyi's 
wishes are accomplished thus, oh, Soumitri, will she be comfortable, somewhat! [3-58-7]

Shlok 8: "Kaikeyi is with her son, with a kingdom, and further her 'purposes are achieved,' oh, gentle Lakshmana, 
and because of the death of her son will my austerely mother Kausalya humbly get into the servitude 
of Kaikeyi, anyhow! [3-58-8]

Shlok 9: "I wish to get at the hermitage again if only that Vaidehi of good-conduct is alive in hermitage, else, 
oh, Lakshmana, if death has already conducted her out of hermitage I too will give up my lives here 
itself. [3-58-9]

Shlok 10: "If Seetha, the princess from Videha, does not chat with me as before smiling gleefully on my arrival 
at the hermitage, oh, Lakshmana, I really breath my last. [3-58-10]

Shlok 11: "Say Lakshmana, whether that pietistic Vaidehi is alive or not? Or, on your becoming unmindful of your 
guard is she consumed by demons, either? [3-58-11]

Shlok 12: "She who is softish by her nature and youngish by her age has never noticed the despair of separation 
from me, and now by my dissociation she will be despairing brokenheartedly, so it seems. [3-58-12]

Shlok 13: "That impostor and highly impudent demon Maareecha who shouted loudly as, 'oh, Lakshmana,' might have 
caused fear even in you in everyway. [3-58-13]

[Commentary] Annex: 'you yourself have said that the Golden Deer is demon Maareecha, but I went after to eliminate 
the very same demon... then, how you are dismayed to hear a trickster's mimicking my voice and came 
rushing fearfully, were you fearful or did I yell like that right from our childhood, anytime...'

Shlok 14: "I hope that Vaidehi has also heard that voice which is similar to that of mine, and I hope frightened 
as she is she might have also hastened you, and I hope you also have come to see me, that hastily! [3-58-14]

[Commentary] Annex: 'maybe, as a woman she is hopeless of my capabilities, but you are a coequal of mine, are you 
unhopeful of my capabilities and came rushing at the haste of a hasty woman, or what!

Shlok 15: "In everyway you have caused hardship by leaving Seetha in isolation, and a leeway is given to the diabolical 
demons for a counterattack against us. [3-58-15]

[Commentary] Aside: 'anyway, a congratulatory hardship is caused by you to the demonic race, in unleashing Seetha 
in isolation from our fetters, and a leeway is given to those diabolic demons as well as to me... as 
I cocksurely attack them now in the name of Seetha, and it is cocksure that they have to surface now 
to counterattack me, instead of these tricks and gimmicks...'

Shlok 16: "Raw-flesh eating demons are distraught as I have liquidated Khara, as a result those ghastly ones would 
have liquidated Seetha by now. There is no doubt about it. [3-58-16]

Shlok 17: "In everyway I am sunken in scourge, but oh, enemy-eliminator Lakshmana, what I can possibly do in present 
situation? Perchance, this sort of scourge is liable to chance upon me, alas!" Thus Rama gave vent to 
his feelings on his way to hermitage. [3-58-17]

Shlok 18: In this way while thinking emotively about that curvaceous Seetha, Raghava hurriedly returned to Janasthaana 
along with Lakshmana. [3-58-18]

Shlok 19: He that Rama who chastened his younger brother en route is worried in aspect and wizened is his mouth 
by hunger, by strain, and also thus by thirst, and suspiring heavily he arrived near at hermitage, and 
became dispirited when he beheld the hermitage in vacuity. That valiant Rama on quickly entering his 
own hermitage found it to be vacuous. Then he rushed out and went round a place of pastime of Seetha, 
saying 'yes, this is that place where she used to move round for plucking flowers.' And again he dashed 
in to hermitage only to find it as an empty cottage. Then he rushed out to some other place of playtime 
of Seetha yelling, 'yes, this is that place where she used play with deer, squirrels and birds.' And 
again came back to vacant hermitage, and again he dashed to some other prayer-time place exclaiming, 
'yes, this is that very place where she offered her daily prayers.' Finally on returning to the vacant 
hermitage he became one who is plunged into hair-raising throes of despair as that cottage is emptied 
of Seetha. [3-58-19, 20]



SARGA 59
------------------------------

[Text] Rama reprimands Lakshmana for coming without Seetha. Lakshmana explains that he had to leave her owing 
to her anguished and angrily words and even by her rash remarks of Lakshmana. Even then, Rama is unhappy 
of Lakshmana's action in leaving her alone.



The content of this chapter is to amplify what that has been said in the previous chapter. This dialogue 
between Rama and Lakshmana may be deemed to have happened before their approaching hermitage, as in 
the last few verses of last chapter, and on their pathway to their hermitage.

Shlok 1: Rama the descendent of Raghu, again asked Soumitri who strayed from the hermitage and whom his own anguish 
is distressing now, in the middle of path towards their hermitage. [3-59-1]

Shlok 2: Rama spoke to such Lakshmana, "when I left her in the forest, I left only on confiding in you. For what 
reason you came to me on abandoning Maithili? [3-59-2]

Shlok 3: "What my heart had been doubting, rather a perilous evil, oh, Lakshmana, that has become a fact on seeing 
only you, coming to me leaving off Maithili. [3-59-3]

Shlok 4: "Seeing your coming without Seetha on pathway at a distance my left eye and left shoulder have pulsated, 
and oh, Lakshmana, my heart too has fluttered." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [3-59-4]

Shlok 5: When Sumitra's son Lakshmana, whose traits are blamelessly auspicious is addressed thus, anguish cast 
a double spell on him, one for the tongue-lashing of Seetha while the other for the reproach from Rama, 
and he replied Rama who is anguished in his own way. [3-59-5]

Shlok 6: "I have not come here leaving her off either independently or intentionally, I came here, to your proximity, 
virtually driven by her hurtful words." Thus Lakshmana is relying Rama. [3-59-6]

Shlok 7: "Maithili gave an ear to that message which is loudly shouted as if by your honour saying, 'ha, Seetha... 
ha, Lakshmana... save me immediately...' [3-59-7]

Shlok 8: "On hearing that grievous voice of yours and owing to her love for you she shuddered with fear and wept 
out to me 'hurry up...get going...' [3-59-8]

Shlok 9: "When she frequently and insistingly compelled me to go, I have replied Maithili in this sentence which 
is expressive of my confidence in you. [3-59-9]

Shlok 10: " 'I do no think that there is a demon who can cause panic to Rama. All this is feigning. Someone might 
have typified his voice in this way, please control yourself. [3-59-10]

Shlok 11: " 'How can my esteemed brother who can safeguard even gods, oh, Seetha, will exclaim in saying, 'save 
me,' which is a highly disparaging and basely manner to call for the help of a lady to safeguard him 
in such circumstances. [3-59-11]

[Commentary] A hero will not expose a lady to risk when he himself is involved in such a risky position. aapat kaale 
strii samaahvaanasya kshudra kR^ityatvaat kutsitam - Govindaraja.

Shlok 12: " 'But, somehow, for some reason, someone mimicking my brother's voice discordantly shouted words saying, 
'Lakshmana save me.' [3-59-12]

Shlok 13: " 'Oh, auspicious lady, it is unbefitting for you to panic, like lowly womenfolk who will be frivolously 
panicking for flimsy reasons, for the words like 'save me,' shouted by some demon, who may conceivably 
be Maareecha. [3-59-13]

Shlok 14: " 'Enough is your slipping into consternation and you be undismayed. There is none in all the three 
worlds who took birth, or going to take birth, to defeat Raghava in any given battle of any terrible 
nature. Raghava is undefeatable even if all gods come battling along with Indra in their van.' This 
is what I said to Vaidehi" Thus Lakshmana is informing Rama. [3-59-14, 15]

Shlok 16: "Though I said thus, while her volition is overly besotted for you, Vaidehi said this tartly word to 
me outpouring tears. [3-59-16]

Shlok 17: " 'In my respect you have harboured only an impure and nastily perspective to achieve me on the utter 
ruination of your brother, but I am unachievable to you. [3-59-17]

Shlok 18: " 'As to why you are refraining to rush towards Rama even though he is inordinately yelling, it hints 
that Bharata made some arrangements with you, and that is the reason why you have closely followed Rama 
in exile. [3-59-18]

Shlok 19: " 'You are an adversary of Rama comporting yourself in disguise, following him because of me, and searching 
for a leeway from Rama. Thereby now you are not rushing to Rama. [3-59-19]

Shlok 20: "When Vaidehi spoke to me thus I hurriedly came out of hermitage to you with anger reddening my eyes 
and trembling my lips. [3-59-20]

Shlok 21: Rama who is deluded by angst said to Soumitri who is speaking thus, that "your arrival without her is 
an improper deed, oh, gentle one. [3-59-21]

Shlok 22: "You know that I am capable enough to foil the demons, even then you have come out by the angry words 
of Maithili? [3-59-22]

Shlok 23: "On hearing bitter words of an angry lady you have came away on leaving her off, such as you are, I 
am not at all happy with you. [3-59-23]

Shlok 24: "That which action of yours is there in non-compliance of my directive to stand guard to Seetha, either 
compelled by Seetha, or coming under your own ire, it shows your dereliction in everyway. [3-59-24]

Shlok 25: "By whom I am detoured from hermitage in the form of a deer he is indeed a demon, and he fell flat when 
my arrow hit him down. [3-59-25]

Shlok 26: "When I effortlessly shot an arrow setting on bowstring and stretching the bow to full length, he hit 
by that arrow left deer's body to become a piteously bewailing demon wearing bracelets and the like 
ornaments. [3-59-26]

Shlok 27: "Then hit down by arrow thus, he with an anguished voice that is clearly audible at a very remotely 
place and that which is mimicking my voice, uttered those highly gruesome words, whereby you have come 
here forsaking Maithili." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana on their way to their hermitage. [3-59-27]



SARGA 60
------------------------------

[Text] Rama laments for Seetha's separation. He starts searching for her and goes on asking every plant, tree 
and animal, in a kind of frenzied attitude. This chapter is too poetic to summarise, hence this much 
is said here.

Shlok 1: While Rama is coming towards hermitage his lower eyelid frequently fluttered, his gait faltered, and 
he missed his footing. [3-60-1]

Shlok 2: On closely watching those inauspicious forebodings Rama indeed uttered oftentimes reflexly thus as, 
'would she be safe, in fact!' [3-60-2]

Shlok 3: He quickened himself and went with an ardency to see Seetha, and then on seeing an empty home his heart 
is distraught. [3-60-3]

Shlok 4- 5: Raghava looked like a flying-flutterer as his speed jostled his arms and gait flutteringly, and on closely 
probing there and there, and all-over the places of that cottage, then he saw the lustreless house of 
straw devoid of Seetha, alike a befogged wintry lotus-lake without lustre. [3-60-4, 5]

Shlok 6- 7: The trees of that woodland are seemingly weeping, as their flowers are witheringly weakening and their 
birds are weepingly warbling, and the animals are whingeingly weeping, and that woodland is charmless 
and utterly shattered, since its georgic deities have completely abandoned it. Rather utterly bestrewn 
are the deerskins and sacred grass blades, rather utterly battered are the tender-grass-seats and other 
mats in the compound of cottage, and he who ardently wanted to see Seetha, such a Rama, on seeing such 
an emptied locale and cottage, wept over, over and again. [3-60-6, 7]

[Commentary] By this bestrewn, battered, or shattered state of articles, it is evident that Seetha struggled a lot 
to get release from the clutches of Ravana, and in their tussle articles are in shambles. Hence, Ravana 
did not carry Seetha on a clod of earth as said in Adhyaatma Ramayana and other texts. Valmiki's Seetha 
is an out and out human, as of now.

Shlok 8: "That bashful Seetha might be stolen by the grudging demons, or slain by the very same grisly demons, 
or savoured by some gruesome beasts, or else she strayed in this gauntly forest, and even she might 
have playfully shrouded herself in the grimly forest, or else she must be sheltering herself in this 
forest which will be gruelling to locate. [3-60-8]

Shlok 9: "Or else, she might have again gone to pick the flowers or fruits, or again gone to lotus-lake, or gone 
to the river for water." Thinking thus, Rama started his search for Seetha. [3-60-9]

Shlok 10: Though he searched effortfully for his dear Seetha he did not get her, and as his anguish is reddening 
his eyes the appearance of that glorious one seems to be that of a madman. [3-60-10]

[Commentary] The word iva 'as though, seems to be, alike...' has some importance from the viewpoint of commentators, 
and some discussion is given in endnote on its usage. Because he is 'like' a madman, the translation 
shall also be 'like' a mad-translation, as long as he talks 'like' a madman.

Shlok 11: Rama ran speedily from tree to shrub, from hill to hillock, from river to rivulet, and revolving around 
them he wailed for Seetha, as he is inundated in a sludgy ocean of woes. [3-60-11]

[Commentary] Whether Rama 'really wept' over Seetha's absence or it the 'playacting' of god - is a much-debated topic. 
As a hero of the epic, it is 'real' weeping and it is necessary to arouse pathos, but should he be god 
or god incarnate, is 'weeping' manifest in the qualities of Omniscient - is the dilemma. Some points 
are presented in the endnote.

Shlok 12: "Oh, Kadamba tree, seest thou someone a lady who is lover of Kadamba flowers, one with a lovable face 
and a love of mine, thou tellest me if thou knowest. [3-60-12]

Shlok 13: "Oh, Bilva tree, if thou seest someone who is drest in yellowy-ochry silks, whose skin likens to the 
silkiness of thine leaflets, breasts to thine rotund and silky Bilva fruits, thou tellest me... [3-60-13]

Shlok 14: "Otherwise, thou Arjuna tree, if thou knowest her who is a lover of thine Arjuna flowers and the ladylove 
of mine, thou telleth whether that slender-waisted daughter of Janaka liveth or otherwise... [3-60-14]

Shlok 15: "As to how this Kakubha tree shineth laden with creepy-creepers, foliole-foliage and flowery-flowers, 
this tree knowest Maithili whose thighs can be likened to the smoothish trunk of this very Kakubha tree... 
[3-60-15]

Shlok 16: "As to how this best tree among all trees heareth the chorus of honeybees that singest around it, thereby 
this Tilaka tree clearly knowest Maithili, a lover of Tilaka trees, as this shouldst have heard her. 
[3-60-16]

Shlok 17: "Oh, Ashoka tree, an alleviator of agony, that is thine name lingually... but practically and readily 
name me after thine, by showing my ladylove, as my agony has marred my empathy... [3-60-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, Palm tree, if thou seest that lady breasted alike ripened-palm fruits of thine, and if thine mercy 
is mine, thou telleth of that shapely lady Seetha... [3-60-18]

Shlok 19: "Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thee knowest my ladylove with golden glitter, thou telleth 
me without hesitation...



"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thou knowest my ladylove whose complexion is smoothish 
like thine Rose-apples, thou telleth me unhesitatingly... [3-60-19]

Shlok 20: "Aha! Karnikaara tree, now thou art in full bloom and blooming magnificently, if thou seest that lover 
of Karnikaara-flowers and an immaculate ladylove of mine, thou telleth me... [3-60-20]

[Commentary] Annex: 'you all might have seen when your friend was imperilled and you might have complained, or cried 
out with the rustle of your leaves or gestured with the swings of your branches, as humans would do 
with their voice and hands... and the birds and bees nestled on you also might have chorused, sadly... 
but those birds and bees are unable to communicate what has happened... you trees, though you may not 
have rushed to rescue her, as you are pegged on ground, you indicate to me, at least with your branchy 
gestures, what exactly has happened...

Shlok 21: Rama has gone on asking trees like mango, niipa, massive saala, jack-fruit, kuruva, dhava, and even 
around daaDima, bakula, punnaaga, sandalwood, ketaka trees, and when he is running around them that 
highly glorious Rama appeared like a madman. [3-60-21, 22]

Shlok 23: "Or else, oh, deer, dost thou know what bechanced to that fawn-eyed Maithili, one with quick-looks like 
thee deer? Or else, hast she herded herself into the herd of she-deer of yours... [3-60-23]

[Commentary] Annex: 'poor trees... they cannot air their expression, hence Maithili is unsaid by them... but you 
deer, you can voice and gesticulate, then voice it out or gesticulate, since that Maithili is an all 
time playmate of you deer... and you are an expert in escaping, and you might have escaped when Maithili 
was in danger, does not matter, it is your nature, now tell me what exactly has happened...' [but, then 
that deer ran in a particular way, but Rama is now unable to decipher it... and concludes,] 'now also 
you are escaping expertly... leave it at that...'

Shlok 24: "Oh, elephant, thou mightst beheld her whose thighs likens to your trunk at that problematic hour, thus 
methinks, and that Maithili is familiar to thee, and oh, best elephant, if thou beholdest her, thou 
tallest me... [3-60-24]

[Commentary] Annex: 'though you are a pachyderm you are keen-eyed and you can find out even a thorn in the weed, 
also you are around this place for a long time, thus well acquainted with all of us... hence I deem 
that something must have happened and somehow you might have seen... though you could not prevent it 
with your massive head, trunk or legs, but tell me what exactly has happened...

Shlok 25: "Fear not, oh, tiger, hast thou seen Maithili, the moonfaced ladylove of mine, if thou hast seen speak 
in good faith... [3-60-25]

[Commentary] Annex: 'I know that you are a master prowler and a brave one, these deer and elephants are somehow fearing 
to tell me, but you tell me because you're a brave one... did you not prowl the prowler of Maithili... 
I also know that equal is the fear when one sees a tiger or when a tiger sees one... now you need not 
lift up your fore-paw and step back on seeing me... as I cause no harm now... but tell me, whether you 
ran after that one who caused some harm to Seetha or not, as Seetha never harmed you, when you were 
on the prowl hereabouts...' But that tiger retraced its steps, because Rama is an archer with a bow 
and arrows, without telling him that without exception all the animals vainly ran after Ravana trying 
to rescue Seetha. Such as he is, an uninformed one, he starts a delirious soliloquy in imagery.

Shlok 26: "Oh lotus-eyed lady, in fact I have seen you my dear, then why this running away and concealing yourself 
under trees, why do not you reply me... [3-60-26]

Shlok 27: "Stay...stay... oh, best lady, don't you have mercy on me? You are not unacceptably tease-humoured! 
What for you ignore me? [3-60-27]

Shlok 28: "Oh, beautifully complexioned lady, even if you are running away your yellowy silk-sari betokens you, 
stay, if you have goodwill for me... [3-60-28]

Shlok 29: "Otherwise, she whom I have just seen me may not be Seetha, why because, it is unapt of her to avoid 
me who attained this wretched state, hence Seetha with cheery smiles is certainly murdered... [3-60-29]

Shlok 30: "Obviously the raw-flesh gorgers must have gorged that youngish lady on diving all her limbs in my absence 
from my dear one... [3-60-30]

Shlok 31: "Her face which is similar to a full-moon with pretty teeth, prettier lips, prettily nose and with prettyish 
earrings, might have obtained a blanched look when being devoured... [3-60-31]

Shlok 32: "But that exquisite and beautiful neck of that lady which shines forth in the colour of Campaka flower, 
befitting for any neck ornament, indeed it might be glutted down while she is bewailing... [3-60-32]

Shlok 33: "Her two arms which are delicate like tender leaves, ornamented with bangles and bicep-lets might have 
been definitely nibbled while they are wriggling with quivering fingers... [3-60-33]

Shlok 34: "This is as though I have forsaken this youngish Seetha really as a feast for the demons in my absence, 
and though Seetha has many relatives she has become as worse as a lonesome woman who is completely forsaken 
by her caravan who is lonesomely ready for the feast of highwaymen, and demons have feasted on her. 
[3-60-34]

Shlok 35: "Ha, Lakshmana... oh, dextrous one... have you seen my ladylove anywhere... ha, dear, where have you 
gone... oh, auspicious lady... ha, Seetha..." thus Rama lamented again and again in his search. [3-60-35]

Shlok 36- 37a: On bewailing in this way and on overly rushing from wood to wood, somewhere Rama has become highly delusional 
by the forcefulness of delusion and spots forest stuff as Seetha, though none of them have any resemblance 
to Seetha, and somewhere else, marking creepers, plants or slender shrubs and suchlike delicacies as 
Seetha he has become really alluded by the powerfulness of allusion, and elsewhere, he is not discriminating 
paths or pathless routes for his trekking as an impassioned one in the search of his ladylove, and thus 
he is nitid like a madman. [3-60-36, 37a]

Shlok 37: Rama is on the rove around woods, rivers, hills, mountain-rapids and thicketed forests, speedily and 
restlessly. [3-60-37]

Shlok 38: On going round the vast of great forest in that way and on searching for Maithili, his hope became intangible, 
but again he undertook the search for his ladylove, over-strenuously. [3-60-38]

[Commentary] Maheshvara Tiirtha says that, 'the word 
iva 'alike, seemingly, as though' is to be ellipted to all the expressions given by Rama, as 
god incarnate Rama did not 'really' weep over...' As such the expressions will become:
shokaat paripluta iva, shokaat pradhaavan iva, vilapan iva etc., and they 
mean 'as though he is inundated in sea called lamentation... as though he wept... as though he ran after...' 
and the like. For this the viSNu puraaNa, umaa samhita is cited as reference, 
where Vishnu himself says: aham 
daasharathiH buutvaa hanmi raavaNam aahave | shrii mad raama avataare asmin aj~navat kriyate mama | tatra 
shankaa na kartavyaa sarvaj~nena api maayayaa | mat maayaa mohitam rakSho manuShyam maam avekShyati | 
anyathaa tasya saa nuunam na bhavet atra kutracit 'I on becoming Dasharatha's son 
will eliminate Ravana in combat... though Omniscient I conduct myself in the incarnation of Rama as 
a commoner by my Maya... thereby no doubt be nurtured by any... believing me a human Ravana will be 
mislead, as there is no other way for his elimination...' thus Tiirtha says that Rama did not actually 
'weep or wail...'

[Commentary] But this is contradicted and said by later commentators, 'though 
Rama is Supreme Being he took up human incarnation and he conducted himself as a human. Hence there 
is no need to ellipt ellipses for many a time and portray him as a 'direct' god on earth. Valmiki has 
said this more than once through Rama's words that he is just a 'human...' aatmaanam 
aham maanuSam manye 'I for myself am a human...' etc., and here also Valmiki used this word
iva only at a few places like unmatta iva, udbhraanta 
iva Even if Rama were to be 'god' on earth, for his fate of taking a human incarnation he is 
fated to behave as a human, and gets involved in human emotions, according to situations and his mental 
conditions. In such conditions, for he is 'god' he can 'evoke' an emotion as he evoked rancour many 
times when eliminating demons as in the episodes of Aranya when he was eliminating Khara, Dushana, and 
others. There is roSam aahaarayat tiivram... 'rancour, evoking, unusual...' 
'and then evoking an unusual rancour to eliminate Khara in war, he eliminated Khara...' as at 3-30-19. 
Here when the word roSam is replaced with shokam 
and if it be said as shokam aaharayet tiivram... it suffices all contradictions. 
And in many other places, we see him aaharayet 'getting' wrath or sadness, 
or other humanly emotion. When he can 'evoke' one human emotion 'wrath', why not evoke other emotions 
like 'love, sadness, pity, kindness' and the like. Again, there are some subhuman emotions like greed, 
avarice, hate, jealousy etc., which are unbefitting to humans themselves, hence the question of Rama's 
evoking them for his activities, does not arise.

[Commentary] Then 'is this playacting of god, of hoodwinking of man called 
Rama in the name of Ravana...' is the connective question. The answer is 'neither...' for it is maya 
of Vishnu. In other way, it is not hoodwinking of Rama but it is the bewailing of god/Rama caused by 
the suffering of his adherents/devotee/subjects - particularly for Seetha, who is not just a devotee 
or adherer, but his own altar ego. Particularly when that god alone, through the so-called destiny, 
karma, fate etc, causes that suffering. Rama admits at verse 34 of this chapter 'this is as though I 
have forsaken this Seetha...' because of his passion for hunting, either the deer or the demon, thus 
bechanced is an ill fate on Seetha.

[Commentary] If Rama were to be god, he is not an 'featureless' god of
advaita tenet, a nirguNa but he is
saguNa 'featured' god and some of his many features are:
svabhaavika anavadhika atishaya, j~naana, bala, aishvarya, viirya, shakti, tejaH, 
saushiilya, maardava, aarjava, sauhaardra, saumya, kaaruNya, maadhuryam, gaambhiirya, audaaryaadi aneka 
kalyaaNa guNa sampanna... of which we are concerned with kaaruNya, maardava 
features, 'pity and sheltering...' as Shudarshanaacaarya defined maardavam 
as aashrita viraha a-sahatvam maardavam 'impatience for the separation 
from his adherers...' and Rama wept with this pity and impatience for Seetha's separation from him.

[Commentary] However delinquent the children be, they do not know or care to 
know what their parents feel about their delinquency, because they themselves are thinking that they 
are not at all delinquent. But their parents, though they are aware of their children's delinquency, 
but unable to mend them, they suffer silently or blatantly. Here too it is the same predicament for 
Rama, though it is not parent-child relation, but it is man-wife relation, worthier enough for more 
suffering. His anguish is for the 'soul' called Seetha, going to be captivated in the 'body' called 
Lanka, and her deliverance is possible only on the annihilation of that body or holder of that body, 
namely Ravana, in the karmic cycle of birth-death. And none has a real glimpse or knowledge of that 
god or soul, but all go on assuming on their own as Bhagavad Gita says at7-24:

[Commentary] avyaktam 
vyaktim aapannam manyate maam a-buddhaya | param bhaavam ajaananto mama avyayam anuttamam | gita

[Commentary] Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest, / Not comprehending Me in my true Self! 
/ Imperishable, viewless, undeclared, - Sir Edwin Arnold. Hence, Rama really wept for Seetha 
and in fact, gods really weep even for us, madly and sadly, but we do not care, or wish to care.



SARGA 61
------------------------------

[Text] Rama laments for Seetha and becomes despondent. But at the advice of Lakshmana both of them start a 
search for Seetha, presuming that she might be available in the proximity. Later they embark on a thorough 
search in the entire forest and its mountains and at lakesides, but Seetha is unseen.



From here, until Rama meets Hanuma in next book Kishkindha, Rama's lamentation is continually portrayed. 
This may not be taken as a mere 'weeping' or 'bemoaning' of the principal character of the epic, but 
this has many poetics and romantics of epical poetry imbibed in it. An epic, basically, requires a hero 
to have his romantic attributes, naayaka lakshaNaaH and these 'wailings' 
will portray all of them. There are various, numerous and voluminous derivatives, meanings and commentaries, 
which cannot possibly be included in here, at this stage, except for passing references on them. Hence, 
this lengthy lamentation has lengthier romanticism.

Shlok 1- 2: On seeing the vacant threshold of the hermitage and empty cottage of straw, also at the leaf-mat-seats 
that are utterly shattered, and not finding Vaidehi even on watchfully eyeing everywhere Rama shrieked 
loudly, and then on clasping the winning shoulders of Lakshmana he said this to him. [3-61-1, 2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, Lakshmana, possibly where can be Vaidehi? Or, to which place she has gone from here? Or, Soumitri, 
who stole her away? Or, who has gorged up my ladylove? [3-61-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, Seetha, if you have concealed yourself under trees wishing to poke fun at me, enough is your fun 
and games, get in touch with me now, as I am highly anguished... [3-61-4]

Shlok 5: "Oh, meek Seetha, with which meekly young deer you were playing, all these are now broody with tearfully 
fluttery looks, without you... [3-61-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: "Really Lakshmana, I will not live long without Seetha, indeed I am enveloped in high anguish caused 
by the abduction of Seetha, and this alone will become a murderer, and on my going to other world when 
murdered by my own agony my father and that great king Dasharatha will definitely observe me in the 
other world... [3-61-6, 7a]

[Commentary] Some other mms contain the word mR^itam 'dead ...' instead of the word vR^itam 'enveloped...' 'when 
I am dead and gone to other world, there my father will ask me...' would then be its meaning.

Shlok 7b- 8- 9a: "When I go to other world after my death our father Dasharatha who is already staying there will deride 
me saying, 'when I have directed you for a fourteen year exile, and when you too have assuredly agreed 
and promised me for that term, how you have to my presence in this ultramundane world without completing 
that term of fourteen year exile, besides breaking your own word of honour... thus you have become a 
wilful disobedient, despicable and dishonest person, such as you are, fie on you...' [3-61-7b, 8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10- 11a: "Anguish seared and bewildered me and I am woebegone with broken down buoyancy, and oh, beautiful lady, 
jilting such an woeful one as I am, where you are going now, as with prestige jilting a prevaricator? 
And if you shun me I will have to shun my life..." Thus Rama bewailed imaging her right in his front 
and running away. [3-61-9b, 10, 11a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Though that legatee of Raghu is desperate for seeing Seetha, though he is highly anguished and agonised, 
though he bewailed this way, that Rama has not found Janaka's daughter, Seetha. [3-61-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 13: To him who is unable to find Seetha, and who is sinking in sadness as with an elephant sinking in a 
chasmal mud, Lakshmana spoke to such a Rama in a positive manner desiring his wellbeing. [3-61-11b, 
13]

Shlok 14: "Oh, well-informed one, do not get into desperation, you make efforts along with me, and oh, brave one, 
this best mountain is beaming forth with many caves, she may be there somewhere. [3-61-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: "Maithili is a fascinated saunterer in woodlands so she might have entered the forest, she is even infatuated 
with waters, so she might have gone to the fully bloomed lotus-lake, or to the river that is adorned 
by fishes and cane-breaks. [3-61-15]

Shlok 16b- 17: "Or, wishing to know our reaction when she scares us with her prank, Maithili might have squirreled 
away into forest. Oh, honourable brother, let us endeavour quickly to search her. [3-61-16]

Shlok 18: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, if you consider that we shall search the forest in its entirety to locate where 
she that Janaka's daughter might be, let us quickly do so. But do not engulf your heart in sadness." 
Thus Lakshmana advised Rama. [3-61-18]

Shlok 19: When Lakshmana good-heartedly spoke this way, Rama self-collectedly made a headway for the search of 
Seetha along with Soumitri. [3-61-19]

Shlok 20: Those two sons of Dasharatha have started a thorough search for Seetha in forests, on mountains, also 
thus at rivers and lakes. [3-61-20]

Shlok 21: On searching whole of mountainsides of that Mt. Chitrakuta, where their hermitage is there, even in 
its caves, crags, and mountain peaks they have not found Seetha. [3-61-21]

Shlok 22: On exploring everywhere on that mountain Rama said to Lakshmana, "oh, Soumitri, here on this mountain 
I do not descry auspicious Vaidehi." [3-61-22]

Shlok 23: While roving searchingly in Dandaka forest Lakshmana who is tormented by anguish said a sentence to 
his greatly resplendent brother Rama. [3-61-23]

Shlok 24: "Oh, insightful brother, you will reacquire Janaka's daughter Maithili, as Vishnu once subjugated Emperor 
Bali and reacquired this earth." [3-61-24]

Shlok 25: But when the valiant Lakshmana addressed him in that way, Raghava whose thinking is marred by poignance 
spoke these pathetic words. [3-61-25]

Shlok 27: "This forest in its entirety, these lotus-lakes with their blossomed lotuses, and this mountain with 
its many caves and mountain-rapids, all are evidently searched. But, oh, sensible brother, I do not 
descry Vaidehi who is loftier than my lives." [3-61-27]

Shlok 28: Lamenting in this way Rama languished owing to the abduction of Seetha and became a pitiable one, and 
while sadness besieging him he is perturbed for a moment. [3-61-28]

Shlok 29: All the limbs of Rama are fluttered, his faculty has become functionless, his fervour is frozen, he 
is forlorn and flustered, and such as he is he sank down suspiring swelteringly and lengthily. [3-61-29]

Shlok 30: Suspiring repeatedly he that lotus-eyed Rama shrieked repeatedly and loudly thus as, 'ha, Seetha...' 
with tears stifling his throat. [3-61-30]

Shlok 31: Though Rama has many kinsfolk who hold him dear he is now left with a single one, namely Lakshmana, 
and that obedient brother Lakshmana who is already anguished for Rama's sadness, then adjoining his 
palms obediently started to pacify Rama with divers methods. [3-61-31]

Shlok 32: But disavowing the word of advice that fell out from the cupped lips of Lakshmana, Rama stridently yelled 
again and again when his dear Seetha has become unseeable. [3-61-32]



SARGA 62
------------------------------

[Text] Rama bewails for Seetha as an ambivert, ambivalent romantic epical hero and asks
Lakshmana to return to Ayodhya, as Rama is certain to perish without Seetha. He thinks his agony
aloud, weighing pros and cons of his situation.

Shlok 1: In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish and
he bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is long
arms. [3-62-1]

[Commentary] Some mms use the word kaama in the compound shoka upahata
cetanaH thus it becomes kaama upahata cetana and then it means 'his sagacity is
marred by desire for Seetha...' and because of the adjacency of word dharmaatmaa
'righteous one...' 'a righteous desire is no sin to desire for... hence his desire for Seetha is
righteous...' Then mahaabaahuu denotes that he is wailing raising his long arms, and
kamala locana is indicative of redness of lotuses, thus his eyes are reddening by his
wailing.

Shlok 2: Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to her
in a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing pampered his articulacy because his speech took
shelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent out
his heart in this way. [3-62-2]

[Commentary] Here the poet is starting the sixth phase among the ten phases called
manmadha avasthaaH 'phases of pangs of love,' and this one is called a + rati
'non-indulgence, the ambivalence, the ambiversion...' of the romantic hero, in romantic epical
poetry.

Shlok 3: "Flowers fascinate you very much, my dear, hence you veil yourself with the full
bloomed branches of Ashoka tree, but that alone is amplifying my anguish because you both have
presently became tormentors. [3-62-3]

[Commentary] We may recount the idea reg. Ashoka flowers expressed at 3-60-17.

Shlok 4: "Maybe, both your thighs liken to the stalks of banana plants, thinking so, now you
have lapped them in grovy banana plants, but I can distinguish which is which, thus now I caught
sight of them, oh, lady, you are inapt at least to cover them from me. [3-62-4]

Shlok 5: "Oh, lady, you are facetiously glorying in the boscage of fully bloomed Karnikaara
trees which is really wafting worry to me, rather than the fragrance of those flowers oh, glorious
lady, enough, enough is this facetiousness of yours. [3-62-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: "I am aware of your humour, lady, and I know that you are jocose, but in a place
like hermitage unmerited is this sort of raillery, even if it is good-natured. Hence, you come
back, oh, wide-eyed one, your cottage is empty. [3-62-6, 7a]

[Commentary] Be it a cottage or a palace, minus a housewife, it cannot be called a 'home' na gR^iham gR^iha iti 
aahuH gR^ihiNii gR^iham ucyate | gR^iham tu gR^ihiNii hiinam araNyam sadR^ishamatam || Maha Bharata, 
12-144-6; bhaaryaahiinam gR^ihasthasya shuunyam eva gR^iham bhavet | 'a house is a house when housewife 
is there, otherwise it amounts to a forest...' 'a house to the householder is a void, if the housewife 
is not there...'

Shlok 7b- 8a: "Oh, Lakshmana, very evidently demons have either gorged up Seetha, or perhaps
abducted her, because she is not returning to me who am whiny indeed for her. [3-62-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Indeed these teary-eyed mobs of deer look as if to explain that nightwalkers have
gluttonised my lady. [3-62-8b, 9a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Ha! My graceful lady, to where you have strayed now... Ha! Chastely and best
complexioned lady, now the ambition of my queen mother Kaikeyi will be fulfilled, as I breath my
last owing to your straying... [3-62-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "I have come to forests with Seetha and have to go back to Ayodhya without Seetha.
How, in all but name, can I step into an oblivion called my palace-chambers? [3-62-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "People will denounce me as a vigourless and pitiless person, and my ineptitude will
indeed be self-evident, for Seetha is led away from me by some tactical being... [3-62-10b,
11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "When the king of Mithila Janaka asks after the wellbeing of all the three of us
after the completion of forest living, how do I have the face to stand him? [3-62-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "On seeing me without Seetha the king of Videha will be distraught by the perishing
of his daughter, and he defiantly goes under the preponderance of perplexity... [3-62-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Instead, I prefer not to go to the city Ayodhya that is ruled by Bharata, because
it must be comforting to one and all under his rulership, but not to me as Seetha will not be with
me... else if, that end of my life occurs now and if I were to go to heaven, even that heaven will
be a void to me without her... I believe so... [3-62-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Hence, Lakshmana, you go back to that auspicious city Ayodhya forsaking me in
forests, because I have no existence without Seetha, isn't it! [3-62-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "On tightly hugging Bharata you shall tell him these words as I have said, 'Rama
authorises you to reign the earth...' [3-62-16]

Shlok 17b- 18: "Oh, efficacious Lakshmana, on revering my mothers Kaika, Sumitra, and Kausalya
justifiably you tell them my good bye, and you as the one who effectuates whatever is assigned to
you, you have to effortfully protect my mother Kausalya by doing whatever she says. [3-62-17b,
18]

Shlok 19: "Oh, the subjugator of unfriendly, Lakshmana... you shall clearly inform in detail
about this perish of Seetha, also that of mine, to our mothers. [3-62-19]

Shlok 20: Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, and
bewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha, is not found and missing from him. Even
Lakshmana became whey-faced, frantic-hearted, highly overwrought, by the fear of uncertainty
looming large on them. [3-62-20]



SARGA 63
------------------------------

[Text] Rama laments while searching for Seetha and reminiscing over his past, which was spent happily with 
Seetha. Rama and Lakshmana search for her at riversides of Godavari but she is unseen there. Though 
Lakshmana continuously encourages Rama for a thorough search without submitting to mere anguish, Rama 
sinks into his own anguish.

Shlok 1: That prince Rama whom agony and anguish are distressing has become anxious in his mien, and he again 
drifted into a dire desperation while despairing his brother Lakshmana. [3-63-1]

Shlok 2: Rama who is sunken in a chasmal sorrow spoke this sentence while wailing sorrowfully, suspiring severely 
and scorchingly, and which sentence is seemly to his sensitivity, to Lakshmana who is already under 
the sway of sorrow. [3-63-2]

Shlok 3: "I am second to none among the blameworthy wrongdoers on this earth, thus I deem, and indeed woe followed 
by woe are getting at me in seriation to burst my heart and mind... [3-63-3]

Shlok 4: "I might have definitely, habitually, and desirably committed damnable deeds in my previous births, 
and now the result of those impious deeds is very much ripened and has fallen on me, whereby I am entering 
misery after misery... [3-63-4]

[Commentary] As with the accrual of merit by good deeds, sin also accrues with impious or sinful acts anena janmaantara 
kR^ita paapa anuruupam phalam bhavati iti arthaH - strii parvaaNi - nuunam vyapakR^itam puurveShu janmaasu 
| yena maam duHkhabhaageShu dhaataa karmasu yuktkavaan - mahaa bhaarata - dk and this ripens and 
bechances at a later time in the shape of misfortune.

Shlok 5: "I am deprived of the kingdom, departed from my own people, mainly Seetha, my father departed and I 
am detached from my mother, and Lakshmana, when all these setbacks are very deeply thought over they 
are replenishing the haste of my agony... [3-63-5]

Shlok 6: "All this sadness of mine has silenced physically and there is some peace on coming to these desolate 
forests, in association of Seetha, but with the dissociation of Seetha misery is again upshot, as with 
fire which flares up in a flash when fuel is added... [3-63-6]

Shlok 7: "My noblewoman might be abducted by a demon, and on reaching the sky that lady who converses with a 
sweet voice might have wept a lot fearfully, and it is definite that she must have shouted a lot, untunefully... 
[3-63-7]

Shlok 8: "Those two roundish bosoms of my ladylove which always deserved the application of pleasantly looking 
red-sandalwood's paste might definitely be unshiny, as they might be bedaubed with muddy blood when 
they are extricated from her body for devouring. [3-63-8]

Shlok 9: "She has a sweet, softish, and very clear talkativeness on her lips. That visage with such lips is crowned 
with a hairdo with hair lumped together and plaited, such as her visage is, it must have become unshiny 
on her going into the repression of demon, as with an unshiny moon when repressed in the mouth of eclipsing 
planet Raahu, it is definite... [3-63-9]

Shlok 10: "The contours of the neck of that strait-laced ladylove of mine are always worthy for necklaces and 
chain-wears. The bloodthirsty demons would have indeed mangled that neck in a secluded place and they 
might have drunk her blood, it is definite... [3-63-10]

Shlok 11: "While I was away from her in this uninhibited forest demons would have forcibly hauled her up when 
they are abducting that lady with broad-bright eyes, and she would have discordantly shrieked out like 
a piteous she-dove, it is definite... [3-63-11]

Shlok 12: "Sitting very close to me on this stone's surface, oh, Lakshmana, she that well-mannered Seetha with 
bright smiles was speaking to you verbosely with all smiles... [3-63-12]

[Commentary] He is recollecting his romantic dalliances with Seetha at the riverside of
Godavari. asmin 'in here, hereabouts which now is devoid of Seetha, she used to playfully
tease me in our swimming sports in this River Godavari...' maya saartham where maya sa
artham 'I thought I was winning... but, she who is used to have an upper hand... hence, then I
became secondary...' udaara shiilaa 'well-mannered' Seetha... for she did not bother me
for such a frolicking when we were in Ayodhya, and she with all her mannerliness maintained a
distance from me, as there were her father-in-law, mother-in-laws in Ayodhya, but here only two of
us who are with ourselves, and we rejoiced freely...' shilaa tale upa upa viSTaa 'on the
surface of any stone wherever I wanted to gain a foothold after straining myself in swim-games, she
used to reach and sit on each and every acclivitous stone, prior to my reaching it, and she used to
spatter water on my face, to continue more swimming... but, I was really fatigued...' then she is
one jaata haasaa 'in whom laughter took birth...she used to burst out peals of laughter...
that declare me as a defeated one...' And then tvaam bahu vaakya jaata aaha 'she used talk
to you a lot, with lots of words, as you are in the habit of always extolling me, and she was
saying to you... 'you two are mightier than the mighty, but I am a woman, you two are males and can
hunt the cruellest animals, but I am woman, a rabbit in the kitchen... but, see how I defeated your
almighty brother...' and the like...'

[Commentary] 'A very interesting and linguistically important case of a prepositional verb is
provided by the verses [that contain] upopaviSTa... upa vish... originally must have meant
'to sit near'. In course of time, the idea of closeness or proximity was lost and it came to be
used in the sense of sitting only. Now when the idea of nearness or proximity had to be expressed
one more upa was prefixed to it. Thus, we see how tautological tendencies were influencing
Sanskrit in the very hoary past. The Ramayana upopaviSTa has its parallel n Hindi paas
baiThnaa [where] baiThnaa is upa veshana which itself means to sit near
upa= paas. But still paas is used with baiThnaa...' The Ramayana, A
Linguistic Study, Pt. Satya Vrat. And to supplement Panditji's above saying, even in English this
is evident and Oxford in saying meaning for proximity, says 'sat in close proximity to them' where
'proximity' itself is one upa and 'close' is another upa... Thus tautology is
same everywhere.

Shlok 13: "Among rivers this Godavari is the best and it is an all the time cherished river to my ladylove, and 
I think she would have gone thereunto. But, at anytime she did not go there, singly... [3-63-13]

Shlok 14: "Or, that lotus-faced, lotus-petal eyed Seetha has gone straight to bring lotuses! Nay, that idea itself 
is incongruous, for she never goes to get lotuses, indeed without me... [3-63-14]

Shlok 15: "But has she really gone to this stand of thicket which is with flowered trees and with birds of divers 
kind! Nay, that thought also is incongruent, because she as a timid one is much scared of solitude... 
[3-63-15]

Shlok 16: "Oh, Sun, you are the knower of performed and unperformed deeds in the world, a wittnesser of good and 
bad deeds in the world, tell me, who am woefully writhing, to where my ladylove strolled, or is she 
stolen... [3-63-16]

Shlok 17: "Oh, Air, whatsoever is there in the world, wheresoever it might be, or whensoever it might have happened, 
and whichsoever it might be, and whencesoever it might exist, that cannot possibly be unknown to you. 
Hence, tell me of the lady from noble heritage... is she stolen, or slain, or strayed her steps..." 
Thus Rama begged of the Eternals for locating Seetha. [3-63-17]

Shlok 18: To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is insensately bewailing 
in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and timely suggestion. [3-63-18]

Shlok 19: "Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let you be with spiritedness 
in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in their enterprises in this world, 
even though the enterprises are highly impracticable..." [3-63-19]

[Commentary] Lack of fortitude and spiritedness will sink anyone in a chasmal self-centred
subjective grief. anena dhairya
utsaahau shokam apanudya kaarya saadhakau iti suucitam - tathaa ca bhaatate - droNa parvaaNi -
abhimanyu vadhe dharma putram prati vyaasaH - shocato hi mahaa raaja hi adhame abhivartate |
tasmaat shokam parityajya shreyase prayated budhaH | praharSham abhimaanam ca cintayet | evam
GYaatvaa sthiro bhuutvaa jahi ariin dhairyam aapnuhi | dk Thus Vyaasa advises
Dharmaraja to have fortitude and courage when he was sinking under the grief for the merciless
killing of lonesome Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, in Maha Bharata war.

Shlok 20: When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of Raghu's lineage, gave 
no heed to it, and since he castaway his fortitude he again encountered an inexplicable anguish. [3-63-20]



SARGA 64
------------------------------

[Text] Rama finds Seetha's flowers and footprints, followed by heavy footprints of some
male massive demon. On detailed probing there appear some more ruins of a combat between two
warriors. Concluding that Seetha is definitely abducted by a massive demon, Rama wants to
countermove the universe, even by waging a war with gods.

Shlok 1- 2a: A pitiable one, such as he is, he spoke to Lakshmana in a pitiable voice,
"Lakshmana, go quickly to River Godavari and find out whether Seetha has gone to Godavari to fetch
lotuses..." [3-64-1, 2a]

Shlok 2b- 3a: When Rama said thus to him Lakshmana again went to the charming River Godavari
quickening his pace. [3-64-2b, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: Searching at many declivities which River Godavari has on its banks Lakshmana said
to Rama, "I do not espy her at ghats, declivities of riverbanks, and she is not replying though I
shouted for her. [3-64-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: "In fact, oh, Rama, to which place she that neutraliser of nervousness, namely
Vaidehi, has got round to, or where that frailty is, that place is really incomprehensible to me...
[3-64-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: Rama who is already stupefied by anguish is now despaired on listening Lakshmana's
words and he personally went straight to River Godavari, and staying nearby that river Rama shouted
in this way, "Seetha... where are you?" [3-64-5b, 6]

Shlok 7: The forest creatures which were asked earlier have not said to Rama that a
deservedly destructible demagogue of demons has divested him of Seetha, likewise now River Godavari
which is now being asked has not informed Rama about Seetha. [3-64-7]

Shlok 8: Though the woeful Rama has asked her, and even though all the georgic beings
impelled her to inform Rama the fact about his ladylove, River Godavari then remained mouthless
about Seetha. [3-64-8]

Shlok 9: She that River Godavari has not informed Rama about Vaidehi just out of fear on
recalling the mien and manoeuvres of malefic-minded Ravana, lest Ravana may drain her away.
[3-64-9]

Shlok 10: Rama who is already in a rundown condition owing to the non-appearance of Seetha, is
further rendered as a hopeless being by River Godavari in the matter of his catching a glimpse of
Seetha, and such a Rama spoke to Saumitri. [3-64-10]

Shlok 11- 12a: "Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply. In the
absence of Vaidehi, oh Lakshmana, really what is that unpleasant word I have to say to Vaidehi's
father king Janaka, also thus to Vaidehi's mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, when I meet them!
[3-64-11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Which Vaidehi is the remover of all my sadness who am a destitute of kingdom and
surviving in forests on forest produce, such as she is, where has she gone, really! [3-64-12b,
13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Though I am distanced from my relatives I deemed that princess Seetha alone would
be an evermore relative of mine. But now when that princess alone is unseen I deem that my
sleepless nights would be lengthy. [3-64-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "I will search all these places of Godavari, Janasthaana and this mountain with many
rapids, perhaps Seetha may be available somewhere. [3-64-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] River Mandakini is River Ganga and here River Godavari is said as Ganga as there
are five Ganga-s panca gangaa Cauvery, Tungabhadra, Krishna Veni, Gautami
[namely Godavari,] Bhaagiirathi. in Southern India and these are held sacred on par with
River Ganga.

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Now all these burly animals are repeatedly looking at me as though to speak to me,
oh, brave Lakshmana, this I reckon with their body language as it were. [3-64-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: But on seeing them pryingly that tigerly-man Raghava has indeed asked them at once
with a voice stifled with tears, "where is Seetha?" [3-64-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19a: When that best king has asked, those animals rose to their feet in a trice and
facing themselves southward showed skyward with their snouts. And while running in the direction in
which Maithili is taken away they are stopping to look back at that lord of people, Rama. Thus they
are repeatedly running, stopping and staring at Rama. [3-64-17b, 18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: By which reason those animals are going in a southerly course on a southerly
terrain, and stopping to peer at Rama, and again clamorously adopting the very same southerly
course, Lakshmana ascertained that reason. [3-64-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: On noticing the lingua franca and even the lingua persona of those animals, that
imaginative Lakshmana spoke to his elder brother, alike a striver striving hard for some
information. [3-64-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21a- 22- 23a: "Oh, godly brother, when you have asked these animals, 'where is Seetha,' they
quickly rose to their feet, and as to how they are showing the track on the ground and the southern
direction as well, thereby we may, for sure, go south-westward to know whether there is some
information about her, or else, even that noble lady herself may be available there..." [3-64-21a,
22, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: On saying "Yes!" to Lakshmana that illustrious Rama of Kakutstha sallied forth to
southern direction followed by Lakshmana, scrutinising the earth on his walkway. [3-64-23b,
24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: Those two brothers who are proceeding while discussing among themselves have seen
the walkway bestrewn with flowers fallen from a person. [3-64-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: That valiant Rama who is anguished to see the drizzle of flowers fallen on the
surface of earth spoke this word to Lakshmana who is equally anguished. [3-64-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: "I recognise these flowers that are fallen here, oh, Lakshmana. In forest I gave
them to Vaidehi and she tucked these very flowers in her bun. [3-64-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: "These flowers are carefully safeguarded by the sun, as they are unwithered yet, by
air as they are unswept by it, and by the glorious earth, as they are unspoilt by that, thus I deem
that these naturals, sun, air, and earth are really proffering a helping hand to me. [3-64-27b,
28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: On saying thus to best one among men Lakshmana, that virtue-souled and dextrous Rama
asked the mountain that is uproarious with rapids. [3-64-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: "Oh, lord among the earth-bolstered mountains, have you somehow seen a beauty by all
her limbs, foregone by me in beautiful woodlands?" [3-64-29b, 30a]

[Commentary] This question contains a reply to Rama in a sort of jugglery of words / parsing
as in - able was I ere I saw Elba. kshiti bhR^itaam naatha 'of earth, among bolsterers, lord; oh,
lordly bolsterer of earth, oh, king Rama; tvyaa virahitaa 'by you, foregone...' maya dR^iSTaa iti
kaschit, kaschit= kaama pravedane ' by me, seen...'



Reply of mountain to Rama:"Oh, lordly bolsterer of
earth, lord Rama, I have somehow seen a beauty by all her limbs, foregone by you in beautiful
woodlands.'

[Commentary] When the question itself becomes an answer it is citra alankaara and the
mountain gave that reply in an echo of Rama's verbiage. Rama takes this as a mere echo of the
mountain, but not a clear reply, and thus angering at it he wants to splinter it down, as said in
next lines.

Shlok 30b- 31a: Because his question is unanswered he is enraged as with a lion enraging at a puny
animal, and then he spoke to the mountain, "show me that golden tinged, golden limbed Seetha, oh,
mountain, no sooner than I devastate all your apices, apiece..." [3-64-30b, 31]

Shlok 32: When Rama spoke to the mountain in this way, that mountain echoed as if it is
revealing Seetha, but actually it has not revealed Seetha to Raghava. [3-64-32]

[Commentary] When the mountain replied echoing the same words of Rama, Rama deemed it silent
on other account of Seetha, but just said 'I have seen Seetha...' Hence, that mountain said
anything but a proper indication, thus it has dishonoured Rama - Maheshvara Tiirtha. The mountain
appeared to have said something but kept mum on other details - Govindaraja. In either way it
silent on other details for fear of later time atrocity of Ravana, thereby Rama wanted to subject
it to his arrows atrocity, now itself.

Shlok 33- 34a: Then Rama of Dasharatha said to the hefty mountain, "When the infernos of my arrows
will burn you down completely and when you will be pared down ashes, you shall be grassless,
treeless and tender-leafless, and thus you become a meritless mountain... hence, show Seetha before
becoming so... [3-64-33, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35b: "Lakshmana, if this River Godavari is not going to tell me immediately about that
moonshine-faced Seetha, now I will dry her up... [3-64-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b- 36- 37a: This way when Rama is highly infuriated and who appeared to burn down anything just
with his eyes, then he has seen on the ground gigantic footprints of a demon, and the footprints of
Vaidehi, who appeared to have run fearfully here and there in a helter-skelter manner expecting the
arrival of Rama, and which footprints are heavily trodden by a demon who followed her. [3-64-35b,
36, 37a]

Shlok 37b- 38: On scrutinising the overly trodden footprints of Seetha and the demon, and a broken
bow, broken quiver, and broken and variously bestrewn chariot also, then Rama became baffle-hearted
and said to his dear brother Lakshmana. [3-64-37b, 38]

Shlok 39: "See Lakshmana, many beads of jewellery and many bits of garlands of Vaidehi have
indeed fallen down, and oh, Soumitri, they are strewn around... [3-64-39]

Shlok 40: "Also the surface of the earth is everywhere interspersed with big and small blood
drops that are akin to golden droplets, you see them Saumitri... [3-64-40]

Shlok 40: "I think Lakshmana, guise changing demons would have ripped and rived Vaidehi, or
divided her into pieces, or they might have gluttonised her. [3-64-41]

Shlok 42: "A deadly clash has occurred here, Soumitri, while two demons were clashing between
themselves on account of Vaidehi... [3-64-42]

Shlok 43- 44a: "Oh, gentle Lakshmana, studded with pearls and gems this great bow of someone is
beautifully decorated, but it is fragmented and fallen to earth. Oh, dear boy, Lakshmana, this bow
may perhaps belong to demons, or else to gods... [3-64-43, 44a]

Shlok 44b- 45a: "Studded with lapis gem beads this golden armour of someone is similar to the rising
sun in its shine, but it is splintered and fallen to earth... [3-64-44b, 45a]

Shlok 45b- 46a: "This hundred-spoked regal-parasol of someone is embellished with divine festoons,
but oh, gentle Lakshmana, its central-shaft is wrecked and it is felled to earth... [3-64-45b,
46a]

Shlok 46b- 47a: "These ghost-faced mules with golden breastplates are macabre in form and massive in
frame, but they are hewed down in war, whose are they, either... [3-64-46b, 47a]

Shlok 47b- 48a: "Somebody's combat-chariot is irradiant and similar in shine to the flaring fire
with a war-pennon, but it is broken and battered down, as well... [3-64-47b, 48a]

Shlok 48b- 49a: "These frightful looking arrows of somebody are gilded and they are as much as a
chariot's axle in their thickness, but their arrowheads are shred and they are manifoldly shredded
and strewn around... [3-64-48, 49a]

[Commentary] The sizes of Ravana's arrows are calculated differently. This ratha aksha maatra
is taken as the length of chariot's wheel and thus it is said four-hundred inches or some 33 feet,
which is unacceptable to some as Ravana did not travel in his chariot with a mega body. In another
way aksha is taken as the 'eye of axle...' Then the diameter of his arrow is said, 'as thick as an
axle...' Some others said the size of arrow is eighty-four inches according to shilpa shaastra
'science of chariot making...' taking this 'eye of axle' into consideration.

Shlok 49b- 50a: "Lakshmana, you see these two quivers packed with arrows are completely shattered,
and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles still in his hands... whose charioteer he
might be! [3-64-49b, 50a]

[Commentary] The word used here for quivers is sharaavara and for this Dr. Satya Vrat says:
'Another word which is also not noticed by Monier Williams is sharaavara. It means an armour kavaca
and occurs at least twice in the Ramayana...' Here and at 3-51-14 of this canto and there it was
used in the meaning of armour. If this meaning of armour is adopted here also, then the meaning of
the above verse may somewhat be,



Lakshmana, you see... these two armours, one belonging to the combatant from this
chariot [that is ripped off by Jataayu and fallen from the body of Ravana,] and the other belonging
to this charioteer, both are encrusted fully with arrows [when Jataayu winnowed the very same
arrows shot by Ravana with both of his wings and thus shot them back,] thus the two armours are
completely shattered... and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles in his hand... either
he... whose is he... and where is the presiding combatant of this chariot....

Shlok 50b- 51a: "Evidently this is the modus operandi of someone who is a male demon, and you see
how my animosity has become hundredfold to eradicate them... [3-64-50b, 51a]

[Commentary] This is the reply to Seetha for she wanted no animosity could be nurtured
towards the demons without a cause, in the opening chapters of this Aranya Kanda. When she herself
became a cause for that animosity, now Rama is indicating the effect of that cause, in saying: 'I
have some animosity towards these demons, but I have not eliminated them sweepingly, but for some
demons occasionally... I thought that Seetha strayed her way, or eaten away by some pauperised
paltry demon... but on seeing the massive footprints I consider this as a calculated and culpable
crime... now that my animosity is multiplied hundredfold, whole of the demonic race will be
eliminated...'

Shlok 51b- 52: "The highly stony-hearted demons that are guise-changers by their wish have either
abducted, or killed or gluttonised saintly Seetha... but, they say that rectitude saves such
saintly persons... yet that rectitude has not saved Seetha while she is being abducted in great
forest... [3-64-51b, 52]

[Commentary] Dharma or Righteousness does not go on safeguarding either its adherents or
antagonists, everyone, everywhere, everlastingly. dharmo rakshati rakshitaH and suchlike sayings
are also time-bound and when the time is negative aapatsu raksha ko dharmaH 'in difficulties which
rightness safeguards?' is the ensuing dilemma.

Shlok 53: "Whether Vaidehi is taken away or taken in by some unknown being, oh, gentle
Lakshmana, then who are the gods who can possibly be benignant to me in this world... [3-64-53]

[Commentary] 'No god can possibly be non-benignant to me, either in this world or in the
other...' Govindaraja.

Shlok 54: "Lakshmana, someone, even if He were a Creator of Worlds, or an Omnipotent, if He
were to be lenient at heart or in His actions, He will be disrespected by all beings, owing to the
unenlightenment of those beings... [3-64-54]

Shlok 55: "I who am mellowly, magnanimous, merciful and yoked only to the wellbeing of all
worlds, such as I am, all of the heavenly gods deem me as non-Omnipotent... it is definite...
[3-64-55]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Even if I am capable of creating, maintaining, and destructing all the
worlds, I am lenient, for I am benevolent... but the unwise are unable to know me, the real me...
evil-doers are reverenced by one and all, though negatively owing to scare... but a do-gooder is
scoffed off, for his deeds are positive and do not yield quick and instant results... and my
Omnipotence is looked down as my impotence...' This concept is amplified throughout Bhagavat
Gita.

Shlok 56- 57: "Have you seen Lakshmana how merits like mercifulness, magnanimity and the like are
inverted to become demerits on getting at me, thus I am unmerited in forgoing Seetha. As such, as
with the sizzle of sun uprisen quelling all the moonshine, now you may see as to how my irradiance
radiates quelling all the merits like softness and fairness for the nonentity of all beings
proactive to demons, inclusive of demons. [3-64-56, 57]

Shlok 58: "Oh, Lakshmana, will the yaksha-s be comfortable now, no; gandharva-s - no; monsters
- no; demons - no; either kinnaraa-s or humans - no, none can be comfortable henceforth...
[3-64-58]

Shlok 59: "Now the welkin will be packed with my arrows and missiles, and I will render it as
an impassable sphere for the treaders in the triad of worlds... [3-64-59]

Shlok 60- 61- 62a: "I will make the triad of worlds quiescent by completely blockading all the
planetary bodies. The night-maker moon will be barricaded, aurae of fire, air and sun will be
devastated, and then everything will be overcast with darkness. Mountaintops will be completely
pulverised, water receptacles will be dried out, and trees, creeping-plants and shrubberies will be
destroyed, and oceans depleted, thus I will bring the triad of the worlds to nought, relative to
the task of Time in extinguishing an era... [3-64-60, 61, 62a]

Shlok 62b- 63a: "If the gods are not going to safely restore Seetha to me, oh, Soumitri, they can
see what my blitzkrieg is, at this very moment... [3-64-62b, 63a]

Shlok 63b- 64a: "All beings cannot fly high in the sky, oh, Lakshmana, as there will be a labyrinth
of my arrows released from my bowstring, minus an intercolumniation... [3-64-63b, 64a]

Shlok 64b- 65a: "Bombarded with my iron-shafts this world will be put to disorderliness, Lakshmana,
you may now witness how the animals and birds will be dazed and devastated... [3-64-64b, 65a]

Shlok 65b- 66a: "Because of Maithili I will render this mortal world de-demonical, de-phantasmal by
force-stretching my unstoppable arrows up to my ears to release them forcefully... [3-64-65b,
66a]

Shlok 66b- 67: "Let the gods witness now the impact of the blaze-crested, thoroughgoing arrows of
mine, projected by my wrath and released by my irascibility... [3-64-66b, 67a]

Shlok 67b- 68: "That being so, when the triad of worlds is completely ruined by my anger will there
be gods, no; demons - no; phantoms - no, none can survive... [3-64-67b, 68a]

Shlok 68b- 69a: "Whatever worlds of gods, or monsters, or even those of demons are there, they will
be splintered and falling down apiece by the fusillades of my arrows... [3-64-68b, 69a]

Shlok 69b- 70a: "Whether she is abducted, or even if she is killed, oh, Soumitri, if the gods are
not going to give back my Seetha I will now jeopardise these worlds with my arrows... [3-64-69b,
70a]

Shlok 70b- 71: "If my ladylove is not returned indeed in a fine fettle as she was before my running
after Golden Deer, I will be annihilating the triad of world in its entirety, together with its
mobile and sessile beings, and I will be sweltering the entire universe with my arrows as long as I
am not going to get a glimpse of her." Thus Rama gave a vent to his feelings. [3-64-70b, 71a]

Shlok 71: Rama on saying thus with his eyes reddening in fury, his lappet-fold of lips jerking
spasmodically, he girded up his jute-cloths and deerskin and twined up the mass of his matted-hair.
[3-64-72]

Shlok 73: When the disposition of that venturesome and infuriated Rama has become in that way
holocaustic, it is like that of Rudra, the All-Inflamer god, when He became like this in earlier
times, intending to inflame the Triple-Cities. [3-64-73]

Shlok 74- 75: On saying so that illustrious Rama, the delighter of world, grabbed his bow from
Lakshmana and gripped it tightly, unholstered a deadly and dazzling arrow from his quiver which is
like a poisonous serpent, and readying it on the bowstring of his bow, that Rama, the vanquisher of
enemies fastnesses, who looked like the Ear-End-Fire, spoke this sentence. [3-64-74, 75]

Shlok 76: "As to how all the created beings cannot counteract the ageing, dying, fate and the
Time at anytime, likewise I too am non-countervailed, when I am coalesced with fury, no doubt about
it..." [3-64-76]

[Commentary] Time is the all-transcending factor and none can countervail it. anena mR^ityu

Shlok 77: "If that princess of Mithila, who has suavely and toothy smiles and who causes
irreproachability to my character if only I can have a glimpse of her, is not returned to me in
fine fettle as she was when she was with me, then I will countermove whole of this universe
together with its gods, immortals, humans, florae and faunas, mountains and waters... and
whatnot... [3-64-77]



SARGA 65
------------------------------

[Text] Lakshmana pacifies Rama with reasonable argument in saying that, owing to the felony
committed by a single soul, the entire world cannot be put to arrow. But a humanly search is to be
conducted first to find him out, who abducted Seetha. If she is unavailable even after a thorough
search, then that which is appropriate to the situation obtaining then, it can be effectuated.

Shlok 1: Lakshmana on seeing Rama who is searing and careworn owing to the abduction of
Seetha, blazing like the doomsday inferno, twinned with the notion of rendering the worlds into
nonentity, kenning at his stringed bow, keen to blaze away entire universe, suspiring again and
again, and who is alike Rudra at the end of era, and whose highly infuriated persona Lakshmana has
not seen previously, became pale-faced and spoke to Rama with folded palms. [3-65-1]

Shlok 4: "Previously, you were self-collected and self-controlled and delighted in the
wellbeing of all the beings. But presently, slipping into fury you are discarding your own
disposition, which is unapt of you... [3-65-4]

Shlok 5: "Grandeur in moon, splendour in sun, motion in wind, and composure in earth are
perpetual and all this perpetuity is available in you, besides an unexcelled honour... [3-65-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: "It will be unapt of you to vandalise worlds for a single-soul's felony. It is
unclear as to whose combat-chariot is this, or by whom, or by what reason it is shattered with its
weaponry and paraphernalia... [3-65-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "This has become a very ghastly place since it is grooved by the hooves of ungulates
and by the felloies of chariot-wheels, and it is wetted with drops of blood, oh, prince, thereby a
combat is fought and stalled at this place... [3-65-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "This is just a solo-combatant's combat but not among duo, oh, best articulator one
among best articulators, I indeed observe that no huge army is eventuated here, nor its stamp...
[3-65-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "It will be inapt of you to wish for wrecking a havoc upon all worlds for an
individual's wrongdoing. Why because, the good-hearted, good-natured kings are they who impose
tenable punishment... [3-65-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "You are always the shelterer for all beings, for you're above all the good-natured
and good-hearted ordinary kings, and who can really deem the ravagement of you wife as an act of
grace... [3-65-10b, 11a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "As no altruist can evoke indignation in a hallowed person who is performing
Vedic-ritual, honestly, these rivers, oceans, mountains, gods, celestials, and cacodemons too
cannot evoke indignation in you, because they are always gentle to you... isn't so... [3-65-10b,
11a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Oh, king, it will be apt of you to wield your bow and search for him who abducted
Seetha, along with me as your squire and standby, and with the help of sublime sages available in
this forest... [3-65-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Let us search the oceans, rivers and forests, and even divers dreadful caves and
different lotus-lakes... [3-65-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Let us intently search the worlds of gods and celestials as long as the abductor of
your wife is unapprehended... [3-65-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b: "Oh, Lord of Kosala kingdom, if the heavenly lords are not going bestow your wife
propitiously, rather after our humanly effort, then you may do whatever you want, seasonably...
[3-65-15b, c]

Shlok 16: "If, oh, king, you with your traits of sincerity, solidarity, simplicity, and
scrupulosity are not going to get back Seetha, then you may you may put whole of the universe to
turmoil with the torrents of your arrows which have swift egress as they are with golden-handles
which are stuffed with eagle feathers, and which mirror up the Thunderbolts of Mahendra in their
trajectories..." Thus Lakshmana appealed to ireful Rama. [3-65-16]



SARGA 66
------------------------------

[Text] Lakshmana reasons with Rama regarding the drastic action Rama is about to take in
annihilating the worlds. He says many pithy references in dissuading Rama. This chapter likens to
Bhagavad Gita, as its terse version.

Shlok 1- 2: While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered
impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of
Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, Rama, as gods have reaped ambrosia after a prolonged churning of Milky Ocean,
you are a reap of King Dasharatha's superlative ascesis and even by his superior acts...
[4-66-3]

[Commentary] The comparison of Rama to ambrosia is noteworthy. Ambrosia is not self-useful
but it is manifoldly useful to every other being. If Rama is useful to all created, animate, or
inanimate beings, inclusive of gods, and the thought of that prime mover to destruct what it is
moving, is self-contradictory. Next, the prime object of ambrosia is to enliven but not to
eradicate, thus that thought itself is self-contemptuous. Next, the very same demons turned
destructive from day one, and now if Rama destructs everything, it tantamount to brand Rama to have
taken sides with demons. This is again a self-critical phenomenon of his incarnation. And so
on...

Shlok 4: "Our father was an enlivener of all the subjects and that king was beholden only to
your rosy endowments, but he obtained godhood by your separation... this is what we heard from
Bharata... [4-66-4]

[Commentary] Annex: 'You know that our father fought demons on behalf of gods and was an
ablest and an impeccable ruler... and you said that our father might deride you in saying: 'you are
a wilful disobedient, despicable and even that way a dishonest one, such as you are, fie on you...'
[as at 3-61-8b, 9a,] but when you resort to undertake still deplorable devastation of worlds, than
that of demons, what will he say of you...

Shlok 5: "If you are unable to withstand this anguish chanced on you, oh, Kakutstha, then how
a simpleton and whose boldness is meagre can withstand it... [4-66-5]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Kakutstha-s are the pure beings shuddha sattva, and you are still purer,
because of the speciality of your birth through some divine dessert given by some yaGYa puruSa, a
Ritual Deity, therefore you should have some divine endowments, if not all, and why do you compare
yourself to a commoner and bewail like this, instead of making humanly efforts... and if a person
of your stature sits bewailing and moaning, whereto a commoner has to go in a similar
situation...

Shlok 6: "Oh, first and foremost man, tell me who is uncaught by mischance, which mischance
will be catchy like fire-catch, and oh, king, even that, that lets up momently... [4-66-6]

[Commentary] Annex: 'I am not imparting any maiden version of Bhagavad Gita to you in saying
that gataasuuna agataa suunau na anushocanti panNDitaaH; maatraa sparshaH tu kaunteya shiita uSNam
sukha duHkhadaa... Gita 2-11, 13; 'This that irks- / Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements- /
Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys, / 'Tis brief and mutable!' but we are in an era of
action, let us undertake some action, rather than bewailing... all this is but brief and
mutable...' but think yourself, what to do next, in a human way...'

Shlok 7: "If you are going to blaze away worlds with your radiance in your ruefulness, to
where the ordinary people in rue shall go for solace, really... [4-66-7]

[Commentary] Annex: 'A farmer fences his farm to not to allow stray cattle to graze the
crop... you are an implicit farmer of this universe and you alone fenced this universe with their
respective protective areas or spheres, say stratosphere, troposphere and suchlike... thus you have
come here explicitly as a fence to this world, and when the fence alone is trampling the crop of
the rightness, who else will come to the rescue of that forlorn elements of crop, called the
inmates of worlds...'

Shlok 8: "World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has become
an egalitarian with Indra, writhe touched him off... [4-66-8]

[Commentary] Yayaati attains heaven after performing many Vedic-rituals. But when Indra asked
Yayaati 'who is the best personality in your kingdom?' Yayaati, as a straightforward person replied
'I am the best in my kingdom...' Then Indra said 'Self-eulogisers have no place in heaven, hence
you return to mortal worlds...' thus Yayaati met with a mischance. Instead of telling as Yayaati,
he is said to be the 'son of Nahusha' which expression suggests disobedience. Once Nahusha made the
Seven Sages, the stars in Ursa Major, as the bearers of his palanquin and hastened them saying
sarpa, sarpa... where that word means 'move fast, move fast...' besides its general meaning
'serpent...' Then Sage Agastya curses Nahusha, 'be like that...' i.e., 'become a serpent...' taking
the general meaning of that word. Then Nahusha, though a renowned personality, for he is accursed
he had to fall supine as a big serpent. So Lakshmana is obliquely suggesting Rama, 'you may be a
god supreme... but it is in your realm... not on earth... on earth you have to behave like an
earthling... wrecking the system from within is meaningless... have some obedience to the set
order...'

Shlok 9: "Which great sage Vashishta is there, who is also the priest of our father, he
parented a hundred sons in one day and like that they are all eliminated in one day by Vishvamitra,
for which Vashishta also lamented, but not for a long... [4-66-9]

[Commentary] Annex: 'world's disposition is such, a hundred living beings may take birth on
one day and even die in hundreds, or thousands in one day... birth entails death... you ordained it
to be so, but when the problem has come right under your seat, you go on bewailing without
undertaking humanly effort... is this befitting...'

Shlok 10: "This Mother Earth who is the mother of worlds and venerated by all animate and
inanimate, or even celestial beings, oh, king of Kosala kingdom, even she undergoes tremors and
earthquakes... [4-66-10]

[Commentary] Mother earth is not only held as a mother of living beings on her surface, but
even Moon, Mars etc., planets are said to have emerged from her, and she is lone female in
planetary system capable enough to produce offspring, and hence she is regarded as the wife of
Vishnu, and hence Vishnu has to incarnate Himself on her periodically, to ease her of her problems.
As such 'your weeping for your loss is subjective, while putting your other wife, namely bhuu devi,
Mother Earth, to suffering by earthquakes, storms, whirlwinds, twisters, and what not... is it
appropriate of you to make her suffer periodically, while you say that your one-time-suffering such
as this one is nonpareil... or what... world's disposition is as such... not even you can change
it, lest it boomerangs...'

Shlok 11: "Which duteous pair is the pair of eyes of the world in whom all the systems of
world are peremptory, though that pair of Sun and Moon are doughtily influential in this solar
system, eclipse draws nigh of them... [4-66-11]

[Commentary] Annex: 'for a while you stop thinking that you as Vishnu are reclining on me,
aadi sheeSha the Divine-Thousand-hooded-serpent-recline-bed of Vishnu in vaikuNTha, yon the
dwaadasha aadtya-s, 'Eleven Suns' and numerous Moons of this Universes... you are now right under
the nose of this solar system, and on earth... and in this solar system there is none supreme than
this mighty sun, and mellowly moon, a pair of eyes of this system, where one opens one's eye by day
and the other closes that eye with his cooling effect by night... and it is also said in Veda-s:
aadityaat jaayate
vR^iShTiH - vR^iShTiH tato annam abhijaayate - candramasau oShadhi vanaspatau
'Sun causes rains, rains cause food, Moon causes herbs and plants of condiments...' and even they,
they are eclipsed occasionally, for they are around the mortal world... and what if, your anguish
eclipses you, temporarily...'

Shlok 12: "Even very great incorporates like earth and suchlike planets, oh, bullish man, or
even the gods, or even all corporeal beings, cannot get release from the predestine of Supreme
Being... [4-66-12]

[Commentary] This verse is held as an interpolate or the problem with copyists, by the use of
the word bhuutaani twice, and even the last compound is said to be self-contradictory sarva
bhuutaani dehinaH or sarva bhuutaadi dehinaH Hence it is up to the grammarians to decide. Some mms
use vedaaH for devaaH in first foot, thus 'even all Veda-s put together cannot transcend the
Absolute...'

Shlok 13: "Oh, tigerly-man, we hear that whether gods like Indra et al., are ethical and/or
unethical, yet they too have the resultant agonies and ecstasies... hence, it is inapt of you to
fret thyself... [4-66-13]

[Commentary] The last compound in second foot na tvam vyathitum arhasi is the 'theme
instruction' in Gita na tvam shocitum arhasi which again appears in the next verse. This has a near
psalm in The Bible: 'Fret not thyself because of the ungodly...' Psalm 37, v 1.

Shlok 14: "Whether Vaidehi is stolen or slain, oh, brave one, it will be inapt of you sadden
like this as with any other commoner without tracking her whereabouts... [4-66-14]

Shlok 15: "Persons of your like who are always equable in their outlook, oh, Rama, they will
remain non-dispirited even if they are undergoing desperate straits, and they will not just sadden
like this... [4-66-15]

Shlok 16: "Oh, foremost man among men, you ratiocinate in subtle pursuit, objectively and
brainily, and great brains will comprehend good and bad in subtlety with their braininess...
[4-66-16]

Shlok 17: "Indiscernible are the rights and wrongs of actions, and indefinite are the
cherished fruits of those actions, and without performing any action, fruits also will be
nonexistent... [4-66-17]

[Commentary] Vividly: We cannot discern the rights or wrongs of any action we perform now in
this lifetime, nor we can recollect the actions done us in earlier births, to asses their rights or
wrongs. And they are indefinite and infirm, because any action we perform it ceases to exist on its
competition. And if we have not performed such an action in last birth, conducive to yield good
result in this birth, its fruition is nonexistent. Thereby we may perhaps muse over our actions
basing on the results occurring now. In any case, nonexistent is the fruits of action, may it be
right or wrong, if there is inaction. This is according to Govindaraja. He uses word a dhR^itaanaam
'infirm' for a dhR^ivaaNaam 'indefinite' and Tilaka uses word ca vartate 'also, happens' for
pravartate 'will be in existence' and in either way the meaning is the same. anena praaptam
sukham duHkham vaa puurva karma adhiinam iti uktam - tathaa ca bhaarate - aaraNyake - yaani
praapnoti puruShaH tat phalam puurva karmaaNaam | dhaataa api hi sva karmaiva taiH taiH hetubhiH
iishvaraH || dk

[Commentary] Another way of declining the meaning is by ellipting the words from previous
verse buddhyaa yuktaa 'with braininess' as below:



"The great brains with their braininess are clearly comprehending the indiscernible,
indefinite or infirm rights and wrongs of their actions, thus they translate their thinking into
action... and thus they are undertaking humanly possible action... but not sitting back, unlike
you...

[Commentary] There is another shade to this verse with some altered verbiage as below:



Oh, brave one, to those that are interested in endeavours, whether or not they are
uninterested in the results of their actions, either rights or wrongs, but even to them cherished
fruits does not occur, effortlessly...

[Commentary] And the commentaries go on expanding these tenets, till this chapter vies with
Bhagavad Gita.

Shlok 18: "Oh valiant one, indeed you alone have said this way to me previously and
repeatedly, who really can profess you even he were to be professedly the Jupiter... [4-66-18]

Shlok 19: "Oh, great discerner, your thinking process is non-explicatory even to gods, but now
that thinking process is obliquely and utterly slumberous owing to your sadness, hence I am
addressing your percipience and this is no schoolteaching... [4-66-19]

Shlok 20: "Oh, foremost one among Ikshvaku, oh, Rama, contemplate the divineness of those
immortals and their pure being in maintaining world order, also consider the humanness of these
mortals and their helpless susceptibility to pain, also count on your own valour that which can
annihilate the whole of anything... and then come to conclusion whether or not to annihilate
everything... but, before that try hard to eliminate the abuser, lest he may abuse many others...
[4-66-20]



"Oh, best one among Ikshvaku-s, oh, Rama, contemplate the divine valour you have
derived, also consider the human valour you have inherited, also count on your own innate valour...
hence, try hard to eliminate the abuser...

[Commentary] The second meaning is when 'valour' is taken as main principle. This verse has
another shade if the compound in first foot is read as, according to some other ancient mms: divyam
ca maanuSam ca astram aatmanaH ca paraakramam | where the word aatmanaH is replaced with astram and
then the meaning is 'you have missiles unknown to humans and you also have missiles unknown even to
gods, by the courtesy of Vishvamitra and Agastya, and you have your own valour, then try hard for
the abuser...'

Shlok 21: "Oh, best one among men, what is it you gain on performing a complete annihilation
owing to a single soul's malefaction, hence, mark him... that malefactor and a malevolent of yours,
and it will be apt of you to uproot him... him alone... [4-66-21]



SARGA 67
------------------------------

[Text] Rama spots Jataayu, whose wings are hacked and who is breathless, and is in his last
moments. On conceding to the suggestion of Lakshmana that they should search for Seetha, they start
searching the forest and at certain place the mountainous Jataayu is seen. Mistaking him to be a
demon Rama wants to kill and speedily approaches Jataayu, but on listening Jataayu's words, Rama
recognises and laments for his wretched situation.

Shlok 1: Even though Rama is elder to Lakshmana he gleaned the ultimate tenor of Lakshmana's
words when Lakshmana just said them expediently because Raghava is a best gleaner of the gist of
advises. [3-67-1]

[Commentary] If the advice is with ideation it can be taken form youngsters... yukti yuktam vaco
graahyam baalaat api subhaaShitam | tathaa ca - anena baalot iiritam api yuktam vaco graahyam iti
uktam - tathaa ca bhaarate udyoge - viduraH - api unmatta pralaapato baalaacca parisarpitaH |
sarvataH saaram aadadyaat ashmabhya iva kaancanam || iti - dk 'youngsters advices
can be taken like gold from the coals...'

Shlok 2: Such as he is that dextrous Rama on controlling his highly heightening fury,
propping against his bedazzling bow spoke this to Lakshmana. [3-67-2]

Shlok 3: "What is to be done by us, oh, dear boy... or, whereto we might go, or, by which
device Seetha is discernable... Lakshmana, now you think of it, clearly... [3-67-3]

Shlok 4- 5a: To such a Rama who is tormented by anguish, Lakshmana said, "it will be apt of you
to search this Janasthaana alone which is rife with many demons, and replete with manifold trees
and climber-plants... [3-67-4]

Shlok 5b- 6: "Here there are unclimbable mountains, glens and glyphs as well. There are divers
and pernicious caverns tumultuous with diverse packs of predators, and here are the mansions of
kinnaraa-s and palaces of gandharva-s, as well... [3-67-5b, 6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "It will be apt of you to steadfastly search in them along with me, and oh, best one
among men, your sort of literati and clever-souls will be unfluctuating in calamities like the
mountains unfluctuating in windstorms..." Lakshmana said so Rama. [3-67-6, 7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: When Lakshmana said in this way to that ireful Rama, he roved entire forest along
with Lakshmana readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his bow. [3-67-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Then Rama beheld Jataayu who is akin to a mountaintop in his gleam, and a best
beatific brave bird among all the birds, but bloodstained and buckling on earth. [3-67-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: On beholding him who is like a mountaintop in his gleam, Rama said to Lakshmana,
"This one has gluttonised Seetha, the princess from Vaidehi, there is no doubt about it...
[3-67-10b, 11a]

[Commentary] 

Shlok 11b- 12: "It is apparent that this demon skulks in the forest in the semblance of an eagle,
and having gluttonised that wide-eyed Seetha he is now reposing comfortably. I will eliminate him
with deadly arrows, whose arrowheads blaze away and which shoot off straightly..." Thus Rama
declared. [3-67-11b, 12]

Shlok 13: On saying thus and on readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his
bow, that ireful Rama rushed towards the eagle, as though to a-tremble the whole of the earth that
which is within the perimeter of oceans. [3-67-13]

Shlok 14: But that bird spewing up frothy blood pathetically appealed to such an ireful son of
Dasharatha, namely Rama, in a pathetic tone. [3-67-14]

[Commentary] Jataayu is firstly recollecting his friend Dasharatha on his deathbed, then he
recounts this Rama as that Dasharatha's son, and hence, the epithet to Rama is
non-non-essential.

Shlok 15: "Oh, boy Rama, blest is your eternality, for whom you are searching as with the
search of a rejuvenescent herb in the vast of forest, Ravana stole that lady and my lives, too...
[3-67-15]

Shlok 16: "I have seen that lady while being stolen by brute-forced Ravana when you and even
Lakshmana absented from her... [3-67-16]

Shlok 17: "I outreached to rescue Seetha... and in a combat Ravana is rendered as one with
utterly battered chariot... and I felled him and that chariot there... onto earth's surface...
[3-67-17]

[Commentary] Some mms use Chatram 'parasol...' for the word atra for 'there...' and prabho
'oh, lord...' for mayaa 'by me...'

Shlok 18: "This one is his fragmented bow and this is his fragmented armour... oh, Rama, this
is his combat-chariot... which, in combat shattered by me... [3-67-18]

[Commentary] Some mms use prabho 'oh, lord...' for etat and sharaaH tathaa 'arrows like that'
for sharaavaram 'armour...'

Shlok 19: "This is his charioteer drop dead onto earth by my wings... when I am overtired
Ravana gashed my wings and flew skyward taking Seetha of Videha kingdom with him, and it will be
inapt of you to kill me who am already killed by the demon..." Thus Jataayu appealed to Rama.
[3-67-19, 20]

Shlok 21: Rama jettisoned his forceful bow when he heard the much desired news about Seetha
while hugging that kingly eagle Jataayu. [3-67-21]

Shlok 22: Even though Rama is comparatively a bold person he involuntarily fell down to
ground, as the onefold scorch of anguish for Seetha is doubled by this predicament of Jataayu, and
he wept over Jataayu. [3-67-22]

[Commentary] Rama's weeping is real or unreal, is a haunted notion for commentators. Here
also he is weeping over. For this Maheshvara Tiirtha says that he weeps and bewails when his
adherents are ill at ease. In Ayodhya vyasaneShu
manuShyaaNaa~N bhR^isha~N bhavati duHkhitaH || utsaveShu ca sarveShu piteva parituShyati |
2-2-40 'Rama feels very sad towards afflictions of men, and feels delighted in
all functions celebrated by people on the occasions of child birth and the like, just as their own
father does...' So, it must be true in respect of Seetha, even. This is agreeable to Govindaraja,
too.

Shlok 23: Jataayu is supine on a single-strait passable for a single-person and he is
suspiring for several times, and on seeing such Jataayu Rama became anguished and spoke this to
Soumitri. [3-67-23]

[Commentary] Here the words ekaayane kR^irChre may mean differently. kR^iChre
'difficultly...' ekaayane 'one-way breathing, breathing in, inhaling difficultly...' and this way
of juxtaposing words, 'Jataayu is struggling for a breath...' would mean more near to the scene,
than a single-strait, or a narrow pathway, which are not uncommon in forests.

Shlok 24: "Mislaid is my kingdom and I am mislocated into forests, Seetha is misplaced and now
this mischance of death on this bird... this kind of misfortune of mine incinerates even Agni, the
Divine-Incinerator... [3-67-24]

Shlok 25: "Even if it were to be a plethoric and limitless ocean, and now if I were to enter
it, or take a swim to the other shore of blissfulness, even that Lord of Rivers runs completely
dry, owing to my misfortune, it is definite... [3-67-25]

Shlok 26: "There will not be any greater unfortunate being in this world than me, even if all
the sessile and mobile beings are put together, by whom such a complicated catastrophic enmeshment
as this is derived... [3-67-26]

Shlok 27: "This decrepit kingly eagle is the friend of my father who is terminally gashed and
recumbent on the floor owing only to the backlash of my fortune..." So lamented Rama for the
wounded eagle Jataayu. [3-67-27]

[Commentary] Some mms use the word mahaa balaH 'great mighty' eagle king, while others use
jaraanvita 'old aged, decrepit...' for a pathetic touch.

Shlok 28: Thus, lamenting in that way for many times Raghava patted the body of Jataayu along
with Lakshmana instancing his parental regard. [3-67-28]

Shlok 29: On hugging that kingly eagle whose wings are hacked off and who is bloodstained, and
on uttering this much, "she who is identical with my lives,... where is that Maithili..." Rama
collapsed to earth. [3-67-29]



SARGA 68
------------------------------

[Text] Jataayu names Ravana as the abductor of Seetha while breathing his last. Though he struggles hard to 
say what all has happened, the Time called death takes him away, at such a time when the important information 
is about to be said to Rama. Receiving that much information at least, Rama consigns Jataayu to funeral 
fire, like his own relative and performs other rites, and then proceeds for searching Seetha.

Shlok 1: Rama on seeing that eagle felled to ground by the atrocious Ravana, said this sentence to Soumitri who 
is an asset for good companionability. [3-68-1]

Shlok 2: "While this bird is venturing in my concern the demon felled him in combat and he is leaving off his 
lives owing to me, definitely... [3-68-2]

Shlok 3: "Obviously, lives in his body are very feeble, oh, Lakshmana, it is natural, isn't it, and he looks 
highly anguished with a dulled voice..." Thus on saying to Lakshmana, Rama then spoke to Jataayu. [3-68-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, Jataayu, if you are in fine fettle to further reiterate words, relate about Seetha, let safe betide 
you, and recount how you are murdered, too... [3-68-4]

Shlok 5: "What is the reason for Ravana in stealing that noblewoman, and even what is the wrong I have committed 
in his respect, keeping which in view that Ravana stole my ladylove... [3-68-5]

Shlok 6: "How was that moon similar heart-stealing face of hers at that time of abduction, oh, best bird, and 
even what are the words she uttered when being abducted... [3-68-6]

Shlok 7: "What is his stamina of that demon? What is his form? And what are his strategies? And where is his 
stronghold? Oh, sire, tell me while I ask you inquisitively..." Rama urged Jataayu thus for information. 
[3-68-7]

Shlok 8: Then that warm-hearted Jataayu with his eyes rolling upwards saw Rama and with a fluttery voice said 
this sentence to Rama who is wailing like an orphan. [3-68-8]

Shlok 9: "Resorting to his illusionistic devices like creating an immense and tumultuous windstorm and cloud-cover, 
the flagitious chief of demons Ravana abducted Seetha... [3-68-9]

[Commentary] Annex: 'he created such illusion only to render me unsteady in my flight combat... and for his escape 
in the dark of the day...'

Shlok 10: "That night walker hacked both my wings when I was overtired, and went southward taking the princess 
of Videha, Seetha, along with him... [3-68-10]

Shlok 11: "My sight is spinning and my lives are stifled, oh, Raghava, I am now seeing golden trees with cuscus 
grass as their treetops... [3-68-11]

[Commentary] The cuscus grass is the aromatic fibrous root of an Indian grass, Vetiveria zizanaoides, used for making 
fans, screens, etc., Urdu kaskas. This odd combination of trees of gold, instead of wood, and grass 
instead of leaves, is an omen of death.

Shlok 12- 13a: "In which spell of time Ravana has gone taking away Seetha, that spell is named as Vinda... if any riches 
are lost during that spell, the original possessor of those riches will repossess them very quickly... 
oh, Kakutstha, he that Ravana is unmindful of that fact and stole Seetha only to loose her... [3-68-12, 
13a]

[Commentary] The daytime has fifteen spells of time that have their own effects on humans. The fifteen are: raudraH 
svetaH maitraH ca tathaa saarabhaTaH smR^itaH | saavitro vaishvadevaH ca gaandharva kutapaH tathaa | 
rauhiNaH tilaka caiva vijato naiR^iitiH tathaa | shambaro vaaruNaH ca eva bhagaH pa~nca dasha smR^itaH 
|| and the Vijaya said above is also called as 'Vinda,' the eleventh spell of the day. bindo 
naama bindu gulikaH | tasmin samaye aarabdham kaaryam kartuH vipariitem bhavati iti suucitam | tathaa 
ca - utpala parimale gauii prakaraNe - manvarka digdantirasaabdhi netraa suuryasya vaara aadi viShaa 
muhuurtaaH | gargamarendraadi muniidraadibR^indaiH te ninditaaH karmasu bindasa~nj~naaH || - iti - dk
Any action initiated in this spell of the day entails adverse effects, in so far as that aim and 
action of the initiator. Ravana, though an eminent astrologer, and though he is said to have written 
an astrological treatise called raavaNa samhita, did not care about it.

Shlok 13b: "On stealing your ladylove Janaki, that chief of demons, Ravana, will ruin himself, as with a fish which 
swallows a baited fishhook... [3-68-13b, c]

Shlok 14: "Impractical is your anguishing for the daughter of Janaka, as you will delight yourself with Vaidehi 
in no time, on killing that Ravana in the vanguard of a war..." Thus saying Jataayu paused for a while. 
[3-68-14]

Shlok 15: Though Jataayu is speaking on to Rama with an alert mind, blood freely flowed from his mouth with shreds 
of flesh as death verged on him, even then he struggled to say. [3-68-15]

Shlok 16: "That demon is the son of Vishravasa... literally... the brother of Kubera..." on saying thus, that 
lord of birds released his lives, which are unobtainable for oneself. [3-68-16]

[Commentary] Information about Ravana is given here in the first stanza of the verse, in a half-way-through manner. 
And the character of Jataayu itself is evanished by a jump cut of the couplet, only to be filled by 
his brother Sampaati in the later parts of Kishkindha Kanda. In between these two stanzas of one verse, 
where one brother says one stanza, the other by another, the episodes of Kishkindha come to take part. 
The second foot just contains the name of Lanka where Ravana dwells. But it is not said here for dramatic 
effect and for the flow of epic through its own course. Further, Jataayu is not 'dead' but he released 
his lives. And he is safeguarding his lives so far, only to tell Rama. For this Skanda Puraana says 
that Seetha blesses Jataayu to live until Rama comes to him, and listens form Jataayu. But she did not 
stipulate as to how much Rama has to listen or how much Jataayu has to report. devii maa~N praahaH 
raajendra yaavat sambhaaShaNam mama | bhavataH taavat aasan me praaNaa iti aaha jaanakii || Maheshvara 
Tiirtha. So, the bird called life flew away for bird Jataayu...

Shlok 17: But the lives of Jataayu departing from his body went into thin air before the very eyes of Rama who 
is still speaking to him with folded-palms, "tell... tell more..." [3-68-17]

Shlok 18: Jataayu flopped his head on earth, sprawled his feet on ground, and then his body collapsed onto the 
surface of earth writhing jerkily. [3-68-18]

Shlok 19: He who is worsened by very many mishaps that Rama, on seeing the mountainous eagle whose eyes are bloodshot 
and whose lives have gone, said this way to Soumitri... [3-68-19]

Shlok 20: "This bird which for years together lived fearlessly in Dandaka forest, a habitat of demons, that bird 
wilted to death, because of me... [3-68-20]

Shlok 21: "He who has longevity over many years, who actively strived for a long for rectitude, he is now killed 
and prostrating before the Time, because of me... alas... it is indeed impossible to infringe the Time... 
[3-68-21]

Shlok 22: "Lakshmana, this eagle which has dashed to rescue Seetha in order to render help to me is slain by that 
brute-forced Ravana, only because of me, you see... [3-68-22]

Shlok 23: "On abandoning great empire of eagles belonging to his father and forefathers this lord of bird has 
now abandoned his lives too, only for my sake... [3-68-23]

Shlok 24: "Universally noticeable are the protective, prepotent, principled ones that are the followers of probity, 
oh, Soumitri, even though their births are avian or bestial... [3-68-24]

Shlok 25: "To me, oh, enemy-inflamer, oh, gentle Lakshmana, anguish caused by Seetha's abduction is not that much, 
when compared with the anguish caused by the perish of this eagle, that too, because of me... [3-68-25]

Shlok 26: "As to how the celebrated and highly renowned king Dasharatha is venerable and honourable for me, likewise 
this lord of birds is also a venerable and honourable one to me... [3-68-26]

Shlok 27: "Oh, Soumitri, get the firewood and I will produce fire by friction of two sticks, as I wish to cremate 
this lord of birds who expired because of me... [3-68-27]

[Commentary] The fire produced in ritual acts is called araNi where a small concavity is made on one stick, and a 
pointed end to the other, and this pointed end is rubbed in churning mode in the concavity of the other 
stick, and then both the dry wood-sticks give out a small fire, which then is taken on cotton, to lit 
a huge pyre.

Shlok 28: "Oh, Soumitri, I will mount this lord of realm of birds onto the pyre and cremate him who is killed 
by a feral demon..." Thus saying to Lakshmana, Rama said this to dead eagle Jataayu. [3-68-28]

Shlok 29- 30: "Oh, greatly mighty king of eagles, by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to, you depart 
to the unexcelled heavenly worlds... you depart to those worlds that are destined for the virtuosos 
of Vedic-rituals, and to those worlds that are destined for the practisers of ascesis amid Five-Ritual-fires, 
and to those that are destined for un-retreating combatants, and to those worlds that destined for the 
donors of lands..." So said Rama to the departed Jataayu. [3-68-29, 30]

[Commentary] 'When a Vedic-ritual is performed the resultant factor is undoubtedly puNya 'merit' for those,
yaj~naaH shiilam sadvR^ittam yeSaam te and the worlds yaa gatiH gamyata iti gatiH - lokaH. 
And this is different to that of practising ascesis amid Five-Fires. ahita agne, ahitaaH paristhaapitaaH 
agnayaH yaH pancaagnayoH yasya saH... 'But animals or birds have no faculty to perform those rituals 
and they have their own course of lifecycle after their demise. Then where is the question of a bird 
going to heaven, which heaven is scheduled to some specialists...' is the objection. But Jataayu acquired 
all those 'merits' when he combated without any retreat a paraa vartinaam and he is getting 
a short cut without undergoing too many other kinds of births, and he is given mukti 'emancipation' 
from lifecycles, for his action on behalf of a godlike Rama is justifiable and befitting to get a final 
release, by word of Rama by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to... where He alone 
can transcend the manmade rules.

[Commentary] 'Then the cremation, that too ritualistic one, is unavailable for birds and animals, how then can Rama 
perform funerals for birds, or get them performed for monkeys, as in the case of Vali...' For this it 
is said, 'that's why Rama had to cremate Jataayu and further said by me cremated ritually and by 
me aptly consented to... as sort of special sanction of mukti, because the animality has 
no authority in scriptures or its rites. Taking some action, endeavouring to protect dharma, 
or obstructing a dharma, itself is superior to mere reverencing a god, or performing a daily 
rot of yaj~na, yaaga-s,, etc., which in itself is a subjective performance. Here Jataayu did 
not attack Ravana keeping Rama or Seetha in view, but attacked Ravana only to play his part in stalling
a dharma, which is not that easy, like purchasing some temple tickets to perform some ritual, 
for and on behalf of ticket holders and their families.

[Commentary] For this it is said in nR^simha puraaNa 
says that mat kR^ite 
nidhan yasmaat tvayaa praaptaa tam dvijottama | tasmaat mama prasaadena viShNu lokam avaapyasi || 
'because of me you attained your demise, thereby you get the realms of Vishnu...' where 'because of 
me' is to be taken not as an individual godhood, but as dharma, 'because of dharma...' itself. 
Hence the special sanctions to Jataayu, where such sanctions are absent in the case of Vali, as he followed 
the course of a dharma and there are many scripts that say Rama gave this emancipation to Jataayu,

[Commentary] 'Has this Rama got no other work than weeping for his beloved ones and patiently performing obsequies 
to all lowborn, lowly subjects like dead monkey, birds, or even each individual demonic soldiers... 
they are all shuudra-s' is haunted feeling to some. For this it is said
na shuudraa 
bhagavat bhaktaa vipraa bhaagavataa smR^itaa | te shuudraa ye hi a bhaktaa janaardane || 'one who 
is devotee of Vishnu cannot be called a shuudra... he is to be called vipra, Bhaagavata... 
but a non-devotee, may he be in any caste, he is a shuudra...' And shuudra is upa lakshaNa 
to birds or animals, thereby even animals and birds are on an even footing, if it comes to paying deference 
to god, and god alone is capable to decree emancipation to every or any being. 'Again it is said that 
Rama is god, but yet he weeps... is it not self-contradictory...' Not so, when a neighbour weeps for 
the hardships of his neighbour, won't the neighbourly god weep...' that too on incarnating as a human...
vyasaneShu 
manuShyaaNaam bhR^isham bhavati duHkhitaH 'when humans are in difficulties, He wails much...' 
but waits much also, till those humans can correct or come over their problems on their own, keeping 
a little faith on Him...' Here also, the sobbing of Rama is comparatively nothing when compared to the 
sobbing for Seetha, because the action of Jataayu is not that sob-ful, in encountering a dharma... 
thus Valmiki is aware of 'good' sobbing and 'bad' sobbing in this sob-stuff, called Ramayana.

Shlok 31: On saying that way, that ethical-souled Rama mounted that lord of birds onto the pyre and he sorrowfully 
incinerated that eagle in a flaring fire of pyre, as he would do in respect of his own deceased relative. 
[3-68-31]

Shlok 32: Then that resolute Rama on going into forest along with Soumitri hunted a robust-bodied, big Rohi animal, 
or, Kesari animal, and then he spread sacred grass on ground to place that offering to the deceased 
soul of that bird. [3-68-32]

Shlok 33: On drawing up the flesh of that Rohi animal and lumping it to gobbets, that highly observant Rama placed 
those gobbets on pleasant greenish pasturelands as obsequial offerings in respect of that bird Jataayu. 
[3-68-33]

Shlok 34: Rama immediately chanted Vedic hymns that are employed in such funerals of one's own paternal people, 
as Brahmans say that those hymns are employable in such rites as they lead the soul of the departed 
to heaven. [3-68-34]

[Commentary] Rama chants two Vedic passages yaamya suukta, naaraayaNa suukta - aapastamba sutra-s  as they are usually 
recited by Brahmans in such funeral rites. Here it is 'so imperfectly conducted, because it is for an 
ineligible bird, that too by an unrelated highborn Kshatriya Rama, reciting unconcerned Vedic hymns...' 
is the objection. Jataayu is beyond any caste or creed by way his devotion to duty and by his self-sacrifice 
while on duty. Hence, he is beyond eligibility or opposite of it. Funerals are to be conducted by one's 
own sons or nearest relatives. If none of the relatives of the dead is present to cremate, they are 
to be undertaken by the king of that kingdom. When Rama blessed the soul of Jataayu to go to highest 
realms, which are far beyond the Veda-s of mortals, it is a sacrosanct act to chant those hymns... on 
human level; hence, Rama's action is clearly pro-Vedic. And in Vaishnavaite tenets everything culminates 
into one - Vishnu. 'the adherents of Vishnu, may it be an animal, like Gajendra, the elephant, or humans, 
like Shabari et al., or a bird, like Jataayu, by Him, by Vishnu alone, they are led to the Ultimate 
course of the realm of Vishnu...'

Shlok 35: Then both the sons of that notable man, namely Dasharatha, on going to River Godavari they have oblated 
waters for that king of eagles, Jataayu. [3-68-35]

Shlok 36: Both of the Raghava-s took funeral baths in the waters of River Godavari and then made water oblations 
to the king of eagles. [3-68-36]

Shlok 37: That king of eagle Jataayu, who has performed a creditworthy deed of stalling and combating Ravana, 
but who is felled by that Ravana, went away to the merited and auspicious heavenly realms of his own, 
as and when consecrated by sublime sage like Rama. [3-68-37]

Shlok 38: Even those two, Rama and Lakshmana, on performing water oblations in respect of that best bird Jataayu, 
and on assertively giving thought to the information given by Jataayu, they like the chiefs of gods, 
namely Vishnu and Indra, went to southerly woods when their mind is set to search for Seetha. [3-68-38]



SARGA 69
------------------------------

[Text] Kabandha captures Rama and Lakshmana while they are searching forests for Seetha. In the meantime, a 
demoness named Ayomukhi wanted to romance with Lakshmana, but Lakshmana cuts her ear and nose and chases 
away. The episode of Kabandha has a turning point in the epic.

Shlok 1: In this way, Raghava-s on offering water oblations to Jataayu went southwestward in the forest and proceeded 
looking around for Seetha. [3-69-1]

[Commentary] They firstly have to go westward in order to go south as said by Jataayu, and as continued in next verse 
onwards.

Shlok 2: On going in southwest direction, both the Ikshvaku-s wielding bows, arrows, and swords, have come about 
a pathway which is an off the beaten track. [3-69-2]

Shlok 3: That pathway is thickly wrapped in and penned up with numerous trees, climber plants, and hedgerows 
from all over, thus that is jammed, blocked and horrid in its appearance. [3-69-3]

Shlok 4: On taking up the southern direction, and on crossing over that highly horrendous and thick of the forest, 
both those spryly energetic brothers moved ahead, speedily. [3-69-4]

Shlok 5: Thereafter, both the highly vigorous Raghava-s have entered the impassable Kraunca forest, on going 
three krosa-s from Janasthaana. [3-69-5]

[Commentary] The Ancient Indian measures for distance, as per Kautilya's Artha Shaastra, a
republication of Penguin are: 1 angula = 3/4 of present day inch; 4 angula-s =
dharnugraha [bow grip]= 3 in; 8 angula-s = 1 dhanurmuSTi [fist with
thumb raised]= 6 in; 12 angula-s = 1 vitasta [span-distance of stretched out palm
between the tips of a person's thumb and little finger]= 9 in; 4 vitasta-s = 1 aratni
/ hasta [cubit]= 18 in; 4 aratni-s = 1 danDa / dhanus [bow]= 6 ft; 10
danDa-s = 1 rajju = 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha = 120 ft;
2000 dhanus-s = 1 krosa / goruTa = 4000 yards or 2 1/4 miles, nearly 3.66 km; 4
krosa-s = 1 yojana = 9 miles, nearly 15 km; and this being so, the British
revenue measured a yojana as a 5 mile distance and Chambers and Oxfords has this 5 mile
figure in their dictionaries, while traditionally a yojana is said as a distance of 10 miles.

Shlok 6-7: Those two brothers who are disquieted by the abduction of Seetha are now agog to find her, and they 
intently explored that forest temporising there and there. That forest is evocative of a congeries of 
many a black-cloud, and it embodies numerous flowers on many a flowered tree, numerous flights of birds 
flitting over them, and numerous animals sprawling under them, and with them that forest is as though 
highly rejoiced everywhere. [3-69-6, 7]

Shlok 8- 9- 10: Then, both the brothers on passing over that Kraunca forest and on going from there eastwardly on a 
three-krosha route, those sons of Dasharatha have seen a horrendous forest in between Kraunca forest 
and Matanga hermitage, which is overspread with various thicketed and impassable trees, and over-sprawled 
by numerous gigantic predators and vulturine birds, and on scrutinising such a forest everywhere, there 
they saw a cave in a mountain, which is abyssal, equal to infernal region, and ever enshrouded by gloom. 
[3-69-8. 9, 10]

Shlok 11: On getting at that cave those manly-tigers have seen a demoness nearby that cave, who is massive in 
shape and misshapen in her face. [3-69-11]

Shlok 12-13: Both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, have seen a demoness there, who is an inducer of horror to the 
dunderheaded dullards, traumatic in her acts and truculent in her appearance, pot-bellied, pierce-fanged, 
overblown, pachydermatous, head hair shaggy, body shape lumpy-bumpy, and she is going on eating massive 
beasts. [3-69-12, 13]

Shlok 14: Drawing nigh of those valorous brothers who are journeying on their way, that demoness actually clung 
onto Lakshmana who is going ahead of his elder brother, saying, "come... let's romance..." [3-69-14]

Shlok 15-16: Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, "I am Ayomukhi, by my name... you won 
me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over... thus, you alone are my lover... 
oh, hero, oh, my husband... you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, 
till the end of this life..." So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. [3-69-15, 16]

Shlok 17: When said that way that enemy-suppressor Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared 
off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts. [3-69-17]

Shlok 18: When her nose and ear are cut off that demoness of hideous mien yelled highly in a high voice, and she 
rushed off as she had rushed in at Lakshmana. [3-69-18]

Shlok 19: When she fled those two brothers who are the eliminators of the friends of their enemies, have travelled 
further into the forest and entered a dense area of that forest, with their spiritedness as their guiding 
force. [3-69-19]

Shlok 20: Though Lakshmana is the one with preparedness, properness, and pureness and thus a highly fulgent one 
by his persona, he prayfully said this sentence to his brother Rama whose anima is radiantly fulgorous. 
[3-69-20]

Shlok 21: "My left arm is strongly shuddering and my heart is as though distraught... and even undesirable forebodings 
are also bidding fair... [3-69-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, exalted brother, thereby you be at the ready by paying attention to my expedient words... these 
forebodings are indeed portending to me as if some hazard is immediately ensuing... [3-69-22]

Shlok 23: "This eerily dreadful bird known to be Vanjulaka is loudly ululating as though presaging our triumph 
in any given conflict that may ensue..." So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-23]

Shlok 24: When those two brothers are searching entire forest for Seetha in that way, they heard a boisterous 
brouhaha emanated as though to completely shatter down that forest. [3-69-24]

Shlok 25: As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the forest, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably 
filling up that forest.



As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the sky, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably 
filling up that forest. [3-69-25]

Shlok 26: But desiring to know the source of that noise that sword-wielder Rama has seen a gigantically giant-bodied 
and gigantesque-chested demon in a section of brushwood along with his younger brother Lakshmana. [3-69-26]

Shlok 27: Then they both had to drew nigh of a waylaying demon Kabandha, who is situated frontally with an overgrown 
body, which is neckless, ergo headless, ergo mouth in paunch. [3-69-27]

Shlok 28: That diabolical demon is peaking like a huge mountain, his hair is horripilate and thickset, and his 
gleam is like a dark cloud, and his sounding is like a thunder. [3-69-28]

Shlok 29: Only one ochry eye blazing like the tongue of an inferno is there on his forehead, which forehead situated 
on his chest. That single eye with incisive and sharp-sight is broad beaming and wide angling, on which 
there are winglike eyelids. That monster is now licking his giant mouth that is stuffed with spearhead 
like fangs, as he has just finished a gobble, and the brothers had to drew nigh of such a demon. [3-69-29, 
30]

Shlok 31: He is eating the highly brutal bears, lions, predators, and elephants, and he is outstretching both 
of his deadly arms, each of which is stretchable to a yojana distance, and the bothers neared such a 
demon. [3-69-31]

Shlok 33- 34a: That demon stayed waylaying the pathway of both the brothers who chanced there, while he is catching 
bears, divers flights of birds, and numerous choicest animals of those and those herds, gripping them 
with both of his long-reaching hands and hauling towards his mouth at his paunch, or dropping them off 
if they are unpalatable, and the brothers reached nearby of such a demon. [3-69-32, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34: On travelling just a krosha distance, then they have seen Kabandha, whose body is colossal, and who 
is heinous and hideous, and who is like living trunk fenced by its shoulders and arms, and who by his 
physique is very deadly in appearance. [3-69-33b, 34]

[Commentary] Earlier it is said that they saw Kabandha in brushwood and now they are seeing him alone at a distance 
of 2 1/4 miles away from them. Their seeing him is continuous and thereby the height of Kabandha is 
established and he can be seen from a distance, as with a hillock. Their pathway is this only and it 
is waylaid by this demon.

Shlok 35: He that overlong-armed Kabandha outstretching his overlong arms snatched both of the Raghava-s, keeping 
them side-by-side in his fists, and wringing them with his might. [3-69-35]

[Commentary] Though both the arms of the demon came to these brothers apart and aside, he snatched them and kept 
his closed fists together, in which they are wrung, so that he can examine them clearly with his single 
eye. This also gave a chance for the conversation between the brothers. Otherwise, if one arm goes one 
way and the other in another way, there will be a gap of 2 yojana-s, as each arm can stretch to a yojana 
distance.

Shlok 36: Though they are the grapplers with swords and brandishers of unerring bows, and though outblazing is 
their pneuma and outstanding is their dexterity, both of those great mighty brothers lost control and 
had to yield themselves to that demon when he captured and dragged them. [3-69-36]

Shlok 37- 38a: In that situation, that valiant Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s, is not verily anguished owing to his 
courage, but Lakshmana is very much anguished, as if he is callow and in an unsheltered state, and he 
that younger brother of Raghava, namely Lakshmana, also dejectedly said this to Rama, the legatee of 
Raghava-s. [3-69-37, 38a]

[Commentary] The expression of 'unsheltered one' of Lakshmana is found as a self-sympathetic and unbefitting to him 
in a crisis. But, when read with the following dialogue of Lakshmana it is correct. He wanted to edge 
over Jataayu in self-sacrifice for the sake of brotherhood. And the boyish callowness is to tell that 
Lakshmana has not recollected for a while, as to how they have handled Viradha, in the opening chapters 
of this canto. His overalled thinking is that his brother should be safe, at the cost of his own self, 
if that comes to that.

Shlok 38b-39a: "Oh, valiant brother, see me, who am out of control on my inner-self, and gone into the control of the 
demon... oh, Raghava, you leave me and get yourself released from the grip of the demon... [3-69-38b, 
39a]

Shlok 39b- 40a: "Indeed offer me as an offering to this quiddity, and you seek safety at your pleasure... and you will 
reach Vaidehi shortly... this is my belief... [3-69-39b, 40a]

Shlok 40b- 41: "Oh, Kakutstha, on regaining the kingdom of our father and forefathers, and when enthroned, oh, Rama, 
it will be apt of you to reminisce me always..." So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b- 42a: But when Lakshmana said that way, Rama said to Soumitri, "Fret not thyself, futilely... oh, brave one, 
your king of persons will not get dismayed, futilely... [3-69-41b, 42a]

Shlok 42a- 43b: In the meantime, that ruthless, log-armed, fiercest demon Kabandha thunderously asked those brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana. [3-69-42b, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: "Who are you two? Your shoulders are akin to the bull-humps, and you are shouldering longbows and brandishing 
broad swords, how have you come about this province? For god's sake, I come across my most dainty morsel... 
[3-69-43b, 44a]

[Commentary] The last compound has different compositions in different mms. It is taken here, as 'dainty morsel' 
as the 'eyes' is ill fitting in the compound, as this demon has only one eye.

Shlok 44b- 45a: "What business you have here, and for which reason you have come here... you chanced for me who am sitting 
here and painfully ravenous... [3-69-44b, 45a]

Shlok 45b- 46a: "Though you are with arrows, bows and swords, and though you are like bulls with sharp horns ready to 
gore... but they are all a waste, as your life has readily become ungainful on reaching nigh of my sight 
and arms..." So said Kabandha, in his arrogant tone. [3-69-45b, 46a]

Shlok 46b- 47a: On hearing that sentence of that vile-souled Kabandha, Rama said this to Lakshmana with a wilted face. 
[3-69-46b, 47a]

Shlok 47b- 48a: "Oh, truth-valiant Lakshmana, now coming to pass is a worst catastrophe, after a worse catastrophe, 
after a catastrophe...namely, the expiration at the hands of this demon presently, and the expropriation 
of Seetha previously, and the expulsion from kingship, still previously... nonetheless, without coming 
across that ladylove, this disastrous despair of ending our lives is coming about... [3-69-47b, 48a]

Shlok 48b- 49a: "Oh, Lakshmana, the efficacy of Time is preponderant and proportional among all beings... oh, manly-tiger, 
why generalisation... see, as to how yourself and even myself are entangled in the tangles of life, 
even though we assert ourselves to be brave and best... [3-69-48b, 49a]

Shlok 49b- 50: Oh, Lakshmana, to show its impact on each and every being Time, or God is unencumbered and unremitting... 
may he be a brave one or a brawny one... or, may they be those that have perfected their missilery... 
when Time chances their nigh, they have to founder... as with a sandy levee... [3-69-49b, 50]

[Commentary] The use of word God for Time is to say that time is a created phenomenon, and to say Absolute is beyond 
time and nature as said na vR^iksha kaalaa prakR^itbhiH yasmaat
prapancam parivartae ayam...shvetaashvatara 
upanishat 6-6.

Shlok 51: Rama being the son of Dasharatha is an indomitable one, besides, a firmly and factually valorous one, 
by which he earned a great renown, and he on telling thus, and on looking over that recalcitrantly vengeful 
Soumitri, then Rama readied himself by his own steadied thinking. [3-69-51]



SARGA 70
------------------------------

[Text] Kabandha's overlong arms are cut off when he wanted to devour Rama and Lakshmana as godsend dainty morsels. 
Then Kabandha wishes to know who these two are and when Lakshmana informs him of Rama, that demon feels 
elated for his accursed state is over at the hands of Rama.

Shlok 1: On prying at those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are completely stowed in the hangman's halter-like 
arms of the demon, and who are enduring within it, Kabandha said this sentence to them. [3-70-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, excellent Kshatriya-s, on seeing me who am miserably famished, really what for you stay cool? You 
are the godsend gobs of mine, and hence now you are almost dead..." So said Kabandha to brothers. [3-70-2]

Shlok 3: Lakshmana who is possessed by anguish, and who is determined to wreck revenge on that demon, said these 
expedient and advisable words to Rama on hearing that demon's word. [3-70-3]

Shlok 4: "This scurrilous demon quickly hauled in you and me to his face level, and he will quickly take us in, 
therefore, we will have to swiftly hack off his lengthy arms at his shoulder level... [3-70-4]

Shlok 5: "Gruesome is this gargantuan bodied demon, and triumphing over just with his arms he has utterly devastated 
this province, and he now wishes to end us... [3-70-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh, king Raghava, killing the non-aggressive is tantamount to the killing of animals that are led into 
Vedic-ritual in its midst is despicable to the kings... [3-70-6]

[Commentary] The text varies with other mms. kratu madhye upa niitaam will change to
kratu madhye apa niitaam in Maheshvara Tiirtha's version, then it translates as 'an animal
led out of the ritual half way through the ritual...' meaning that 'the animal unbefitting for
sacrifice...' And that is to say 1] an animal not prearranged and sanctified right from the
beginning, but brought in the middle of ritual; 2] or, one that is brought for ritual which has to
yield without being aggressive pratikaara hiina shakti; 3] or, paryagni kR^itaa na
araNyaam utsR^ijyam a himsaayaa 'unsanctified or wild animals brought from wilds are to be let
off, unhurt...' 4] or, one that which is not at the sacrificial post - it is not to be
sacrificed...' and Lakshmana says addressing Rama as 'oh, king, you have to let off those beasts,
but not this beastly demon who is aggressive and contemplating a regicide...'

Shlok 7: On hearing all of their conversation that demon is infuriated, and then widely opening his ferocious 
mouth he started to wolf down both of them. [3-70-7]

Shlok 8: Then both the Raghava-s are very highly gladdened as the demon is hauling them towards his eye at shoulder 
level, and as they are the brothers with circumspection, they instantly mutilated his arms right at 
their shoulder joints only with two swords. [3-70-8]

[Commentary] This compound su sam hR^iSTau is as per the text of Govindaraja and
Maheshvara Tiirtha states this as su sam vignau meaning 'very highly agitated...' agitated
at the short time available to cut off his hands, before falling into his well-head like mouth. And
this expression 'very highly gladdened' is for the righteous advice given by Lakshmana,
circumspectly.

Shlok 9: Then that dextrous Rama with an unrestrained speed hacked off the right arm, and valiant Lakshmana on 
his part hewed down the left arm that speedily. [3-70-9]

Shlok 10: He that overlong-armed Kabandha fell down with mangled arms, reverberated the sky, earth, and all of 
the ten points of horizon with a cacophonous voice, like a black-thunderous-cloud. [3-70-10]

Shlok 11: That demon on seeing at his dissevered shoulders on which the gushes of blood are overflowing, he self-piteously 
asked those two bold ones thus as, "who are you..." [3-70-11]

Shlok 12: When that great mighty Kabandha is asking thus, Lakshmana who has prosperous characteristics has informed 
him about Rama of Kakutstha, an unremitting dynasty. [3-70-12]

Shlok 13: "He is known to people by the name of Rama, the legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty, and you know me as his 
younger brother, Lakshmana, by my name... [3-70-13]

Shlok 14: "Countervailed from kingdom by mother this Rama is bluntly sent to forests, and he is on the rove in 
great forests along with me ad his wife... [3-70-14]

Shlok 15: "A demon stole his wife while he whose leverage is like that of god is living in the unpopulated forest... 
and wishing to retrieve her we came here... [3-70-15]

Shlok 16: "But who are you? Your legs are broken, and your mouth is infernal, yet it is on your chest, and alike 
a topless, rootless tree trunk you are sprawling in the forest, how so, or, for what reason?" Lakshmana 
asked the demon thus. [3-70-16]

Shlok 17: But Kabandha is highly delighted when Lakshmana spoke that way, as the words of Indra came to his memory, 
and he said these words in reply. [3-70-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, manly tigers, by my providence you are revealed to me... welcome to you... and providentially sheared 
are these shackles, called my two arms, by you... [3-70-18]

[Commentary] The arms, mouth-to-stomach, and another organ are the epitomes of mortals. A
mortal does everything with arms and devours anything with mouth. martyaa kartaa bhoktaa
ca Now those shackles of mortality are severed and he is ready for immortality.

Shlok 19: "Oh, manly tiger, actually how this form of mine is disfigured, of course owing to my distrustful behaviour, 
that you may listen while I narrate it to you. [3-70-19]



SARGA 71
------------------------------

[Text] Kabandha requests Rama to incinerate him, so that he would get his divine form and then would be able 
to give some clues in regaining Seetha. He admits that the present hideous state has chanced only because 
of his arrogant behaviour, thereby a sort of repentance has occurred in him. A course of conversations 
occurs among these two, as each is distrustful of the other.

Shlok 1- 2a: "Oh, great dextrous Rama with great daring and dashing, as to how the physique of sun, moon, and even 
that of Indra is there now, my physique was also like that earlier, an unbelievable mien and renowned 
in all the three worlds... [3-71-1, 2a]

Shlok 2b- 3a: "Such as I was with an admirable body, disguising myself in this kind of horrendous form which is utterly 
dreadful to the world, I was scaring the forest living sages, there and there... [3-71-2]

Shlok 3b- 4a: "On one day, when a great sage named Sthuulashira was collecting divers forest produce for his Vedic-ritual, 
I scared him with this ugly form and I even exasperated him... [3-71-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: "On seeing me that sage who is an enforcer of deadly curse cursed me in this way, 'that which is presently 
diabolic and despicable form of yours, hereinafter you will abide in this form alone...' [3-71-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b-6a: "When I begged that enraged sage as, 'even if I have committed this blasphemy owing to my blasphemous 
fate, will there be an end to this blasphemed form of mine, or not...' and then he spoke this word to 
me... [3-71-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b-7a: " 'When Rama incinerates you in an uninhibited forest on chopping off your shoulders, then you will 
regain your own grand and auspicious form...' So said the sage to me... [3-71-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "Oh, Lakshmana, you may know as the most handsome son of Danu, and this misshapen form has chanced on 
me owing the ire of Indra in battlefield... [3-71-7b, 8a]

[Commentary] The cause of curse is said so far and now the effect is narrated, and

mayaa raNe vikramya pradharShita shakraH - so says dk about it.

Shlok 8b- 9a: "I have gladdened Grandparent Braham with severe ascesis and He granted longevity to me, and then a 
kind of recalcitrance touched off in my mind... [3-71-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: " 'When longevity is acquired by me what Indra can do to me...' thus relying upon that kind of certitude, 
I jousted with Indra in a bout... [3-71-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "But the Thunderbolt that has a hundred cutting edges and that which is launched from Indra's hand has 
rammed by head and thighs into my body... [3-71-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "When I begged of him saying, 'lead me to the hell of Yama, rather than making me to live this hell 
of a body...' Then Indra said this to me, 'Let the Grandparent Brahma's word about your longevity come 
true...' Thus Indra spared me to me... [3-71-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: " 'By the impaction of Thunderbolt disarranged are my thighs and head, thereby my mouth went into my 
stomach... and without thighs how can I prowl, without arms how can I scrabble, and without a mouth 
how can I guzzle... and how am I capable to live on, and even that living too, is destined for too long 
a time...' [3-71-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "When I said to Indra this way, Indra devised for me yojana long arms, also that way a rapier-fanged 
mouth in my paunch... [3-71-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Such as I am, I have been eating the lions, elephants, animals, and tigers that are on the move in 
this forest, hauling them in with both of my overlong arms... [3-71-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Indra has also said to me, 'as and when Rama hacks off your arms along with Lakshmana in a conflict, 
then you can go to heaven...' Thus Indra said to me and vanished. [3-71-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "Oh, sire, I am grabbing whatever I see in this forest while living with this body... oh, powerful king, 
as I feel it meetly and a must for me... [3-71-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "I believed that Rama will certainly come nigh of my captivity, and confiding myself in this kind of 
determination, presaged by sage Sthuulashira, as well... I have been toiling to dislodge this body... 
[3-71-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "Oh, Raghava, as to how this has happened in this way according to the sum and substance told by the 
sage Sthulashira, you alone are that Rama, let safe betide you, and none other than you is capable to 
mangle me... [3-71-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Oh, impetuous man Rama, if I were to be beatified by you two by incinerating me in Fire, I will advice 
you about the next course of your action... I will further advise you about your prospective friend..." 
So said Kabandha to Rama. [3-71-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: When Raghava is said thus by that Kabandha, the heir of Danu, that duty-minded Rama said this word to 
Kabandha while Lakshmana is hearing. [3-71-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] This Kabandha and his lineage is an enigma and variously said at various places, just by deflection 
of one or two words. This being the riddle of grammarians, we are supposed to know that he is a demon 
blessed for gandharva-hood, and then accursed to demon-hood, and then becomes a gandharva again and 
goes to heaven, at the blessing of Rama. The last compound in second stanza differs with that of other 
mms, in wording, but not in its meaning.

Shlok 21b- 22a: "Ravana conveniently stole my illustrious wife when myself and my brother exited from Janasthaana... 
[3-71-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "I only know his name but not the form of that demon... and we are unaware either of his stronghold 
or of his staying power... [3-71-22b, 23a]

[Commentary] It appears that Rama is dealing with this Kabandha with a half-belief, because he is rehashing the same 
good old parroting. Here there is a mutual distrust. 'What if this demon when reduced to ashes cannot 
say anything... like Viraadha...' is the distrust in Rama, and 'what if I am going to say the name of 
Sugreeva now itself, before they incinerate me, and on knowing the name of Sugreeva, what if this Rama 
departs quickly to Sugreeva, without burning me...' is the mistrust of Kabandha. The averral of Rama 
to Kabandha is unclear so far, and in order to put his case straight Rama has to rehash, so he is going 
over again. The same is the case with Sugreeva. He blatantly lies to Rama that he does not know Ravana, 
in Kishkindha Kanda. And if insisted Sugreeva, or to that matter of fact Seetha, both are ready with 
their self-assertive dialogue:   kaH na aparaadhyati  'who errs not...'

Shlok 23b- 24a: "It will be apt of you to show befitting mercy on us who are anguished by agony, running all over helter-skelter 
like unsheltered ones, and we who will be compliant for your restitution... [3-71-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "Oh, brave Kabandha, on bringing dried up firewood that was rent at times by elephants, and on digging 
a large trench, we will incinerate you in it... [3-71-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: "Such as you are, if you actually know who stole Seetha, or whereto she is stolen, either... you clearly 
inform of her when incinerated, thus you will be rendering a most gracious deed to me, and to all concerned..." 
Thus Rama made clear of his case. [3-71-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b-27a: When he is said thus that expert articulator Kabandha replied Rama, who is also an expert enunciator, 
with expedient words. [3-71-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: "There is no divine knowledge to me as of now... nor I can identify Maithili... but when I am burnt 
I assume my own original divine form, and then I will be able tell about him, who will find her out... 
[3-71-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29: "With this unburnt body, oh, Rama, I indeed have no ability to discern anything, hence oh, lord, I will 
be able to speak about him who can familiarise you with that great mighty demon, by whom your Seetha 
is stolen, only after that incineration... [3-71-28b, 29]

Shlok 30: "Oh, Raghava, utterly distorted is my acumen, indeed, by the blemish of curse... and this form which 
is despicable to world has bechanced only because of my own antics... [3-71-30]

Shlok 31: "Oh, Rama, soon you have to toss me into trench to burn me customarily, sooner than the Sun's going 
to Mt. Dusk when his horses are fatigued... [3-71-31]

[Commentary] Now Rama started to believe Kabandha because the simile used by him refers to the dusking Sun with fatigued 
horses. Though Kabandha is always telling that 'I have no knowledge... I lost my discernment...' etc., 
half told is the fact that there is someone out there to help Rama. Hence, the believability is bechanced. 
Sun's horses will never be fatigued, but fatigued is this Kabandha in this grotesque physique, as a 
vehicle predestined to communicate some information to Rama. And when a dusking Sun is indicated, another 
dawning Sun is also indicated, in his freshness. So also, Kabandha is about to resurrect after this 
incineration, as a vehicular messenger for Rama.

Shlok 32: "Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, when I am scripturally burnt by you in a trench, oh, great valiant 
Rama, for sure, I will tell of him, who can quiet fathom that demon... [3-71-32]

Shlok 33: "Oh, Raghava, you have to befriend him with an amicable comportment... and that valiantly alacritous 
one will be gladdened by the sequel of your friendship, and he will evolve a succour to you... [3-71-33]

Shlok 34: "Oh, Raghava, nothing is there in all the three worlds that is unfamiliar to him, for he circumnavigated 
all worlds once, in a different context... [3-71-34]

[Commentary] Even now Kabandha is not naming Sugreeva, only for fear of loosing Rama, without burning the half dead 
Kabandha. Kabandha knows that humans do not burn or bury the undead, and Rama may now leave this dying 
Kabandha to his natural death, and go away. But Rama is already acquainted with the dying ceremonies 
of demons, where they die only after a physically dead, perforce, by consigning them to fire or burying 
them alive, as in the case of Viraadha. Hence this stingy maiming and baiting of Kabandha is continued, 
to burn him down, perforce.



SARGA 72
------------------------------

[Text] When Rama incinerates Kabandha he resurrects as a celestial being and detailing about Sugreeva he urges 
Rama to befriend him. He informs Rama that Sugreeva is also in a similar condition and he needs some 
one to rely upon, in order to overcome his problems, and thus Kabandha asks Rama to help Sugreeva, and 
get help as requital from Sugreeva.

Shlok 1: When Kabandha said that way, both those brave men and lords of people, on throwing the body of Kabandha 
into a mountain cleft and then embedded it with firewood. [3-72-1]

Shlok 2: On his part Lakshmana started to torch that pyre with highly sparkling torches from all over, and even 
that pyre too suddenly blazed with blazes from all over. [3-72-2]

Shlok 3: That massy body of Kabandha is full with fat and while it is being cooked, it is in simile with a massy 
gob of ghee. But the Fire had to stew that body tardily, though that stewed meat is Fire's favourite 
dish, because of that body's massiveness. [3-72-3]

Shlok 4: In a trice that highly dynamic Kabandha zoomed up shoving off that pyre, and he is now attired in lily-white 
vestments and angelic garlands, and appeared like a fumeless fire. [3-72-4]

Shlok 5: Then highly gladdened Kabandha jumped up onto sky from the pyre, and there he is irradiant with unsullied 
clothing, and fineries decorated on every limb. [3-72-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: On going to firmament Kabandha is now seated in a dazzling celestial aircraft yoked with swans, which 
endows renown because it takes the occupants to the realms of Brahma, and sitting in that celestial 
aircraft he said this sentence to Rama, while his own great glimmer and glitter beamed forth in all 
ten quarters. [3-72-6, 7]

Shlok 7b- 8: "Oh, Raghava, how you will regain Seetha, that you listen from me in its essence... oh, Rama, by which 
and which analyses everything will be analysed, six of such ideations are available in this world... 
and when a person is touched down by a spell of nemeses, he shall adore one who is equally in such spell 
of nemesis... [3-72-7b, 8]

[Commentary] The six ideations employed by kings in kingship are 1] sandhi a covenant with adverse kings; 
2] vigraha continuing hostilities; 3] yaana waging war; 4] aasana sit out 
for proper time; 5] dvaidhii bhaava creating factions and vicissitudes in enemy groups; 6]
samaashraya taking shelter under a coequal.

Shlok 9: "Oh, Rama, you along with Lakshmana went into a spell of nemesis, and thus you have become an underprivileged 
one, and that spell alone has obtained you this dire straits, in the form of abducting your wife... 
[3-72-9]

Shlok 10: "Oh, best among kind-hearted ones, thereby you have to certainly befriend such a soul in similar dire 
straits... however deeply I may think, I am not able to perceive your accomplishment if you do not befriended 
with such a soul... [3-72-10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, Rama, listen what I tell... a vanara is there by name Sugreeva, who is vengefully reneged by his 
brother Vali, the son of Indra... [3-72-11]

Shlok 12: "That self-respectful valiant Sugreeva is living on the Mt. Rishyamuka, a best mountain available in 
the lambent fringes of Pampa Lake, along with four other vanara-s. [3-72-12]

Shlok 13: "He that Sugreeva is a masterful one among vanara-s, highly mettlesome, self-resplendent, and illimitable 
is his self-radiance... and he is also truth-bound and culture-bound... a mastermind, master-hand and 
a taskmaster... [3-72-13]

Shlok 14: "He is a capable adventurer, a courageous exploiter and incomparable one in intrepidity and a brave 
one in incursions, and his personality will be coruscating ever and anon, for he is the son of Sun-god... 
but he is banished by his self-conceited brother owing to the reasons of kingdom... [3-72-14]

Shlok 15: "Oh, Rama, he will be your associate and an aid in searching for Seetha, and he conducts himself in 
your wellbeing, hence let not your heart yield to agony... [3-72-15]

Shlok 16: "Oh, tigerly Ikshvaaku, further nothing can be countermanded in this world which is indeed ineluctable, 
and it is impossible to countervail against Time, isn't it... [3-72-16]

Shlok 17- 18a: "Oh, bold one, you go straight from here to that great mighty Sugreeva, and oh, Raghava, on going from 
here now and promptly you fraternise with Sugreeva... and to not to bode any ill of unfriendliness among 
you two, you make him a friend before blazing Fire, making that Fire as an Attestor of your friendship... 
[3-72-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "You shall not look down on that lord of monkeys taking him as a lowly simian, why because that Sugreeva 
is a valiant one, a guise changing wizard and presently he is in the need of a bolsterer, and if you 
render help he will be obligated to you for ever... [3-72-18b, 19]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Now you two are capable enough to effectuate the desired task of Sugreeva, isn't it... whether his 
own purpose is achieved through you or not, he will effectuate your task... [3-72-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "Sugreeva is the son of Riksharaja, and the direct son of the Sun, but Vali trespassed against him. 
Wary of Vali's onslaughts Sugreeva is wandering around Pampa... [3-72-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b-22a: "Oh, Raghava, right away and candidly you make that monkey Sugreeva, a wanderer in the forest, sheltering 
himself on Mt. Rishyamuka, as a friend of yours taking an oath on your weapon besides the Fire-witness... 
[3-72-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] The compound aayudham sam ni dhaaya  can mean in the three possible ways as said above. 
Any one, or three meanings can be obtained, as intensifiers.

Shlok 22b- 23a: "With his expertise that straightforward monkey Sugreeva is indeed conversant with all of the strongholds 
of anthropophagite demons in the world in their entirety... [3-72-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "Oh, enemy-subjugator Rama, as far as the thousand rayed sun manifestly irradiates the world, oh, Raghava, 
thus far, nothing in the least is unfamiliar to him, isn't it... [3-72-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "He makes the monkeys to purposefully rake over the expansive rivers, extensive mountains and their 
impassable cliffs and caves in locating your wife... [3-72-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26: "Oh, Raghava, he expedites giant bodied monkeys in all directions to search for her, who is agonised 
by your parting, and he quests after the residence of Ravana for that comely lady Maithili... [3-72-25b, 
26]

Shlok 27: "Whether that unreprovable ladylove of yours, Seetha, is located on the tops of Mt. Meru's peaks, or 
abiding on the planes of nadir of the earth, he that defiant one among fly-jumpers, Sugreeva, on entering 
there and annihilating the demons, he again bestows Seetha to you..." So Kabandha continued his advise 
to Rama regarding Sugreeva. [3-72-27]

[Commentary] Kabandha's suggestion that 'a bewailer shall befriend another bewailer...' is apparently a meaningless 
suggestion, keeping mythical imports aside, for a while. Though Kabandha is unaware about Ravana and 
his activities, he is aware of Vali and Sugreeva, according to his present narration. He should have 
advised Rama to befriend Vali, who is in power and a powerful one too, instead of Sugreeva. It is not 
so, is the reply from the viewpoint of dharma. This Kabandha has suffered his best in taking wrong routes 
and just now, he resurrected after making many amends, and he is supposed to advise Rama to go on a 
right path and to a right personality as Vali is already established as a pursuer of wrong path. But 
Vali when talking to Rama at his death time says that 'I would have brought Maithili in a single day, 
I would have roped Ravana and brought him like an animal tide with roe around its neck...' etc. But 
they are all his expressions at death-time-wisdom. He did not care for Tara's advices nor bothered to 
talk to Rama, as to why Sugreeva is instigated upon him. This being so, when immortal wisdom has dawned 
on Kabandha, he cannot ask Rama to tread a wrong path to get his task done. This is what the viewpoint 
of Dharmaakuutam. Though untranslated verbatim the above is the gist of the following.

[Commentary] This is to say that dharma is far beyond mere politics, whether monarchical or otherwise. To 
uphold that dharma, one has to undergo certain painful processes, that may be you, or we, or 
may they be godlike or godsend Rama or Lakshmana.



SARGA 73
------------------------------

[Text] Kabandha extols Pampa Lake and details Rama about the course to be adopted to proceed to Mt. Rishyamuka 
to befriend Sugreeva. He details about Matanga hermitage and implores upon Rama to visit an anchoress 
name Shabari, who is waiting for ages to have a glimpse of Rama.

Shlok 1: On showing a concept for questing after Seetha that context-sensitive Kabandha further spoke this sentence 
which is inclusive of right concept to Rama. [3-73-1]

Shlok 2- 3- 4- 5a: "Oh, Rama, have a recourse to westward, and where the trees of Rose-apple, Priyaala, Jackfruit, Plaksha, 
Banyan, Tinduka, Pipal, Karnikara, Mango, and others... and even trees like Dhanva, Naaga, Tilaka, Naktamaala, 
blue Ashoka, Kadamba, Karaviira, Agnimukha, Ashoka, red-sandalwood trees and Neem trees will be heart-pleasingly 
shining forth in full blossom, that alone is an optimistic course for you. [3-73-2, 3, 4, 5a]

[Commentary] The botanical terms for some of these trees are given to some of the above in the first chapter of Kishkindha.

Shlok 5b- 6a: "On shinning up those trees, or else, even on forcefully pelting those fruits down onto ground, then 
you may pelt over, devouring those ambrosial fruits... [3-73-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "On crossing over that parkland, oh, Kakutstha, another parkland with blossomy flowers is there, which 
replicates the heavenly Nandana gardens, and a replica of North-Kuru, an all-endowing province... [3-73-6b, 
7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "Wherein the trees fruit all-season fruits that transude nectar, why fruits alone, in that parkland 
all seasons are coeval, as they will be in Caitraratha, the celestial gardens of Kubera... [3-73-7b, 
8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "In there, the trees bear enormous branches which will be crouching under the weight of their own fruits, 
and everywhere such trees will be shining forth like shiny clouds and shining mountains... [3-73-8b, 
9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Let Lakshmana present those ambrosial fruits to you either by climbing up those trees to pluck them, 
or else by pelting them to ground, according to his convenience... [3-73-9b-10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Peregrinating finest places by trekking from mountain to mountain, from forest to forest, oh, valorous 
ones, you will trek to an auspicious lotus-lake, called Pampa... [3-73-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "It is un-pebbly, un-slippery, un-weedy thereabouts, oh, Rama, equal are its quaysides and emersed are 
its sandbanks, red and blue lotuses beautify that Pampa Lake... [3-73-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b-13a: "There the indwellers of Pampa Lake's waters, oh, Raghava, namely the swans, cranes, Kraunca-s and fish-hawks 
will be letting out peeps in tuneful voice... [3-73-12a, 13b]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Thereabout birds will be unflustered on seeing humans, because they are artless to avoid hunting, because 
none kills them, and you may savour them because those birds will be best and burley, similar to ghee-gobs... 
[3-73-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] Comment: A word about Rama's vegetarianism or otherwise is incorporated at endnote.

Shlok 14b- 15- 16a: "Oh, Rama in that Pampa Lake there are best fishes, red-carps, and blunt-snouted small porpoises, and 
a sort of sprats, which are neither scraggy, nor with many fish-bones. Lakshmana will reverentially 
offer them to you on skewering them with arrow, and on broiling them on iron rod of arrow after descaling 
and de-finning them. [3-73-14b, 15, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 18a: "While you eat those fishes to satiety, Lakshmana will offer you the water of Pampa Lake, which will 
be in the bunches of flowers of that lake, and which will be lotus-scented, pellucid, comfortably cool, 
shiny like silver and crystal, uncontaminated and that way pristine, by lifting it up that water with 
lotus leaf, making that leaf a stoup-like basin... [3-73-16b, 17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19- 20a: "Oh, best one among men Rama, at Pampa you will see best shaped Vanara-s who have their bunk bed in 
mountain caves, and who will be coming nearby the lake, greedy as they are for water, and those forest 
movers will be moving about in evening time of the day, bellowing like bulls... oh, Rama, Lakshmana 
will show them to you... [3-73-18b, 19, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "While roving in the evenings, oh, Rama, should you see the serenely water of Pampa, with her trees 
garlanded with their own blooms and twigs, you will discard your own dolour... [3-73-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] The word viTapin was originally an adjective of vR^iksha, viTapi VR^iksha, meaning 
a tree having twigs. In the course of time the sense of vR^iksha was appropriated [by viTapin 
] to itself and the use of vR^iksha along with it fell out. There is no more conjecture. Pt. 
Satya Vrat in 'Ramayana - A Linguistic Study' and here twigs are upa lakshaNa for blooms and 
then, 'trees garlanded with its own blooms and twigs...'

Shlok 21b- 22a: "Oh, Raghava, there you will see highly delightful and wide-ranging trees like Tilaka and Naktamaala, 
and fully bloomed red and blue lotuses, as well... [3-73-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "Oh, Raghava, there is none someone to inwreathe the garlands of those flowers, and indeed, they neither 
dry up, nor drop down... [3-73-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24- 25: "Erst there were self-collected sages, the disciples of Sage Matanga, and at one time while they were 
bringing the forest produce as ritual paraphernalia, they were much wearied by its weight and they were 
sweating... and all of those earthbound strings of sweat-drops that quickly dropped from their bodies 
were wafted by air onto trees, and on them they reoccurred as strings of flowers, by the merit of the 
ascesis of those sages... oh, Raghava, since those flowers have emerged from sweat-drops, they are imperishable, 
indeed... [3-73-23b, 24, 25]

[Commentary] The above wafting of sweat drops onto trees is as per Govindaraja. In another way, the sweat drops fell 
onto ground and from them trees grew up, and they flowered unwithered flowers - Then as they laboured 
through the dell / From limb and brow the heat-drops fell: / Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous 
trees: - R.T.H. Griffith

Shlok 26: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, albeit the passing of those sages through the pearly gates, their maidservant, 
a long-lived one and an anchoress, named Shabari, can be seen there, even today... [3-73-26]

Shlok 27: "Oh, Rama, she who always stands by probity will depart to the sphere of heaven, on attending to you, 
for you are the referent to god, and a reverent for one and all... [3-73-27]

Shlok 28: "Oh, Rama, thereafter on your taking course to that western bank of Pampa Lake, oh, Kakutstha, there 
you will see the unequalled and arcane place of hermitage of sage Matanga... [3-73-28]

Shlok 29: "Sage Matanga so methodised that woodland, where even the elephants are rendered incapable to trespass 
in that hermitage of sage Matanga disturbing its serenity... [3-73-29]

Shlok 30- 31a: "Oh, the legatee of Raghu, that woodland which in simile is like a godly forest, similar to the heavenly 
Nandana gardens, overspread with divers birds is renowned as 'Matanga woodland', and oh, Rama, you will 
take delight rejoicingly in that woodland... [3-73-30, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32: "In front of Pampa there is a bountiful but an unclimbable mountain is there with trees in full blossom, 
which is well-protected by baby elephants, and which in earlier times was purposefully created by Brahma, 
and that alone is Mt. Rishyamuka... [3-73-31b, 32]

[Commentary] It is difficult to climb this mountain hence Hanuma airlifted Rama and Lakshmana to Sugreeva. Brahma 
purposefully crafted it, as the only shelter to Sugreeva. Its flowers are ever blossomy and fruited 
to feed Sugreeva and the other four monkeys in exile. Baby elephants are enough to keep guard for that 
mountain, then why tell about the capacity of full grown ruttish elephants. This prearrangement is owing 
to the presage of Brahma.

Shlok 33: "And should a man sleep on the heights of that mountain, and should he dream of gaining some riches 
in that sleep, he gains that much when he wakes up... [3-73-33]

Shlok 34: "But he who is diabolic in his deportment and devilish in comportment, climbs that and hopes to sleep 
soundly, demons capture him while he is in sleep, and rough him up to death, there itself... [3-73-34]

Shlok 35: "Oh, Rama, there the blaring trumpet-blasts of baby elephants that amuse themselves at Lake Pampa, and 
of those that are the indwellers of Matanga hermitage, even there on Mt. Rishyamuka are audible... [3-73-35]

Shlok 36: "The mighty and massy dark-cloud coloured elephants will be hitting head-on, and with dripping blood 
streams on their jumbo heads and temples, they disperse and move about separately, only to come together 
for yet another round of head-to-head collision... [3-73-36]

Shlok 37- 38a: "There the elephants are quenched on drinking water of Pampa Lake, that is daintily clean, and neatly 
clear, springlike for touch, and in which all scents of flowers of that lake are included, and then 
they will be collectively re-entering the forests, for they are forest ranging elephants... [3-73-37, 
38a]

Shlok 38b- 39a: "On your seeing the bears, also thus the tigers and even the exultant sapphire-blue Rurus with black 
stripes there, you will discard your distress... [3-73-38b, 39a]

Shlok 39b- 40a: "But oh, Rama, a cavernous cave lidded with a boulder stone outshines on that mountain, and oh, Kakutstha, 
problematic is an entry into it... [3-73-39b, 40a]

Shlok 40b- 41a: "On its right at its eastern opening a delightful lake with highly coolant waters is there, fringed 
with divers trees and fraught with numerous tubers and fruits... [3-73-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b- 42a: "Sugreeva dwells in that cave along with four other monkeys, and at times he will be available on the 
peaks of that mountain, even on its bluffs and cliffs, for he is a terrified monkey..." Thus Kabandha 
informed them. [3-73-41b, 42a]

Shlok 42b- 43a: That impressive Kabandha adorned with divine garlands and abiding in sky scintillating with the grandeur 
of the dazzle of the sun has bidden both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana thus, awaited a bid adieu 
from them. [3-73-42b, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: Rama and Lakshmana who started off on their peregrination said this sentence to that highly providential 
Kabandha, who is temporising in the sky in their vicinity, thus as "you may proceed..." [3-73-43b, 44a]

Shlok 44b- 45: On getting the orders for departure from those two brothers who are highly gladdened at the information 
given by Kabandha, he that Kabandha who is ready to exit, he further said to them thus, "proceed for 
the purpose of achieving your task..." [3-73-44b, 45]

Shlok 46: Kabandha who redeemed his divine form has now got an aureole around him, and while irradiance is tamping 
whole of his mien, he moved further up on sky and reappeared. And staying in the sky he pointed out 
at the side of Mt. Rishyamuka, and then he reiterated, "you befriend Sugreeva..."and then he vanished. 
[3-73-46]

[Commentary] Lakshmana's killing, dressing of birds and fishes, and Rama's munching them - is a heatedly debated 
topic in web forums of all sorts. Some commentators of Ramayana have totally contrived the above expressions, 
to give a touch of vegetarianism. Even when Rama killed Rohi animals as offerings to dead Jataayu, there 
also it is contrived to mean as some roots or tubers. When Seetha says to Ravana who came in the guise 
of Brahman friar, that Rama will fetch much meat and I offer that on cooking aamiSam aadaati puSkalam 
This also is contrived as some tubers and fruits.

[Commentary] This pro-Jain, pro-Buddhist touch of vegetarianism is an enforced virtue on Vedic-ism. The only and 
real vegetarians of India are the Jains, and Jainism is a 'holier than thou...' sect of Vedic-ism, for 
their hymns and biija akshara-s are nothing but the derivatives of Vedic hymns. But these are 
a fed up lot with the then overtures of the practisers of Vedic-ism, and cleaved themselves from Vedic-ism 
to form Jainism, and even today they stick to their principles of non-violence, even towards the tiniest 
ant. Then came this Buddhism, a 'peaceable than thou...' sect of the Vedic-ism, for their jaataka 
katha-s and other teachings are nothing but the Vedic lore. This ism, though called a peaceable 
one, meaning 'unwarlike...' has conducted many wars and is splintered manifoldly, only because of the 
overtures of its practisers, allowed by their patronising kings. There used to be another sect caar 
vaaka-s an 'intellectual than thou...' sect, but they are termed as nihilists atheists, non-believers 
etc., and their literature is totally ruined as they used to colloid with theists, demanding to prove 
god, materialistically. These are highly sophisticated, well-versed in all Veda-s, debaters with utmost 
precision. These three ism are not called separate religions than Vedic-ism, but a vaidika mata-s 
where mata is not a religion, but a philosophy, viewpoint, a darshana.

[Commentary] Any religion, sect, or a following when patronised by the local sovereign, acquires bullhorns and snake 
fangs and starts to invade others, keeping themselves under the shade of their patronising king. So 
is this Buddhism, and it attained its 'warlike' tarnish by the swordsmanship of Ashoka, the Great. Besides 
spoiling its own original and peaceable tenets, Buddhism has equally spoiled the Vedic-ism, by the time 
of Ashoka itself. Even Ashoka has not converted himself to Buddhism overnight, but after a series of 
studies. He was a Buddhist before Kalinga war, but warred and massacred Kalinga, and a Buddhist and 
butchery - does not go hand in hand. By the way, Buddhists are no vegetarians, including Ashoka, but 
his edicts ask all others to not to eat meat.

[Commentary] Even today verifiable are the dietary habits in the provinces where the preachers of Buddhism have gone 
or not sent, or rendered useless, say Bengal. The usual route of Buddhists of Ashoka's period is from 
Patna to Orissa, and to Andhra. And Andhra was stronghold of Buddhists, once when aacaarya naagarjuna 
was there, who established a Buddhist University in Andhra, to which students from far Japan used to 
come. Even today, excavations are going on and Buddhist edicts are coming out, around Naagarjuna Sagar 
dam. The other route from Andhra is to Sri Lanka, down south. The details about the itinerary of these 
Buddhists preachers, better call them as door-to-door campaigners of Ashoka's, greatness than Buddhism, 
can be found in their legend, the third sangiitini, masterminded by the mentor of Ashoka, namely
moggali puttastha vira, , someone like Gobbels of Hitler. And rampant was this pseudo-Buddhism 
in South India, much abetted by the then pseudo-Jainism, to where bhadra saalastha viira was 
sent on his way to mahaa taamra parNi dviipa present day Sri Lanka, headed by Ashoka's son 
Mahinda [Mahendra, and along with the sister of Ashoka,] besides, his duuta-s to the court 
Antiocus II Theos [grandson of Seleucus,] Ptolemy II Philadeliphus, King of Egypt; King Antigonus Gonatus 
of Macedon; King Alexander of Epirus... so on. Thus, they successfully propagated about Ashoka, rather 
than the tenets of pure Buddhism, and as a result, that Buddhism is corrupted, back home.

[Commentary] Though Buddha said at his last stage vaya dhamma sankara - appamadena sampadeta 'decay is an 
innate feature in all beings, acquire your salvation unfalteringly...' where appamaadena is
a pramaadena 'without, carelessness...' But the later time overenthusiastic practisers decayed 
Buddhism carefully and unfalteringly in its homeland. In these times of Ashoka, the customs and habits 
of Vedic-ism merged into the then pseudo-Buddhism, and a commixture of Vedic-ism and pseudo-Buddhism 
resurfaced, and Vedic-ism became pseudomorphic Brahmanism. Along with it, the dietary habits have changed 
completely, and vegetarianism of Jainism has come to stay, and thereafter it just turned to egg-tarianism, 
and presently going on to hamburger-ism and pizza-ism.

[Commentary] This being so, the orthodox Hinduism lays taboo on meat eating in respect of Brahmans only, that too 
by reckoning the eras, the Indian yuga theory. In satya yuga no distinctions recorded, 
in treat yuga, dwaapara yuga-s of Ramayana and Bharata times, Brahmins are permitted only some 
non-veg items, called prokshita aahaara as can be seen in Rama-Vali conversation, and sage 
Agastya bans ram's meat, that too only for Brahmins, after Vaataapi-Ilvala episode. In kali yuga 
non-veg is completely banned for Brahmins, not by scriptures, but by the impact of the then despots 
of pseudo-Buddhism. The kali puruSa is entered through Duryodhana in dwaapara yuga 
of Maha Bharata time, but somehow world is saved by Krishna and Arjuna. Now we with a sarcastic affection 
call that kali has entered through Ashoka, and kali yuga is the period dating from 
Ashoka's despotic days. When a state of topsy-turviness occurs to Veda-s themselves in kali yuga 
, where Veda-s are breathing their last at present, there is nothing to speak of dietary habits of those 
eras.

[Commentary] There are many web pages saying or objecting that Rama is a practiser of a himsa not non-violence 
of Jains, but non-butchery of living beings. Valmiki never said that Rama is a Buddhist Monk 
or a vardhamaana, tiirthankara of Jainism, but depicted him as Hindu Kshatriya, and no taboo 
is prescribed to this warring class in eating meat or chicken. Yet the lamentation will be like this: 
"Lord Rama, a great, divine exemplar of dharma and virtue for Hindus, himself apparently doesn't care 
much for vegetarianism and ahimsa..." "[Rama:] 'I must to lonely wilds repair, abstain from flesh, and 
living there on roots, fruit, honey, hermit's food, pass twice seven years (14 yrs.) in solitude. To 
Bharata's hand the king will yield the regent power I thought to wield, and me, a hermit, will he send 
my days in Dandak wood to spend.' " -- Ramayana 2:20. [Griffith, Ralph T.H. The Ramayana of Valmiki: 
translated into English verse. Benares: E.J. Lazarus & Co., 1895. p.117]. It may please be noted that 
vegetarianism is different from non-violence and it belongs only to Jain tenets, and later to Gandhian 
principles, but not to Hindus or Buddhists. The meaning of the above verse is 'being a hermit I will 
abstain from food that inculcates raajasa, taamasa pravR^itti an aggressive, assaulting mood... 
where certain kinds of meat stuff cause an aggressive mood...' and Griffith had his own metrical exigencies 
to incorporate all the subtexts and underlined meanings in those iambics. It is unclear as to why hairs 
are counted on eggshells, without grasping the essence of the epic's idea of eliminating vice, where 
vice is Ravana and his diabolic activities. Rama's character may not be taken as a meek, weak, bleak 
backbencher, but take it as a blitzkrieg assaulter, aggressive invader, that too only on vice. If he 
were not to kill an edible animal how can he create a holocaustic extirpator of demons in the last episodes 
of the epic, or shall he start chanting on battlefield dhammam sharaNam gaccaami, sangam sharaNam 
gaccami that too, to Ravana - needs to be explored. Firstly let us ask ourselves whether we want 
a Ravana or a Rama, whether they eat meat, chicken 65, or biryaani, or Italian ice creams.

[Commentary] Whether Rama is a god or no god, he is the princely Kshatriya, and if a warrior Kshatriya subsists on 
tubers and fruits, and on other insipid food, we can imagine how grand his warfare would be. If Rama 
were to be a god, why God created a big fish that eats a small fish, why birds and animals of prey, 
and why a niSaada that kills a bird at the start of Ramayana. Hence, taking dietary habits 
as acquired habits, but not godsend or tabooed ordinances of scriptures, the meanings of these verses 
of Kabandha are not contrived to establish any vegetarianism. Incidentally, these are the advices of 
raw-flesh eating Kabandha and we do not see Rama feasting comfortably on birds, fish, or on Kentucky 
chicken, at Pampa.



SARGA 74
------------------------------

[Text] Shabari is emancipated from mortality after her showing Matanga hermitage to Rama. Both the brothers 
approach Shabari as said by Kabandha and she adores them on their seeking her presence. She honours 
them as visitant guests and expresses her desire to depart to the spheres where her teachers are. Rama 
gives consent to it, on which she offers herself into fire and emerges as a divine angel, to ascend 
to heaven.

Shlok 1: Both the sons of that best king Dasharatha, on taking up westerly path in that forest travelled on the 
passage to Pampa as shown by Kabandha. [3-74-1]

Shlok 2: Those two, Rama and Lakshmana, while seeing several of the ticketed trees on mountains which have nectarous 
fruits on them moved forward to see Sugreeva. [3-74-2]

Shlok 3: Those two legatees of Raghu on making a sojourn on the mountaintop, they the Raghava-s drew nigh of 
the moorland on the westward of Pampa Lake. [3-74-3]

Shlok 4: Then on getting at the westward moorland of that lotus-lake Pampa, there those two have spotted the 
idyllic hermitage of Shabari. [3-74-4]

Shlok 5: On getting at that hermitage and on perusing at that picturesque environ that is wreathed round with 
several picturesque trees, those two came nigh of Shabari. [3-74-5]

Shlok 6: On seeing them that sublimated yogi Shabari instinctively made palm-fold, got up imperatively, and then 
she braced the feet of Rama, and even that of sagacious Lakshmana, impressively. [3-74-6]

Shlok 7: She gave them water for feet-wash and mouthwash, and other viands customarily affordable to visitants, 
and then Rama asked after that anchoress who is unflinchingly abiding in her duty. [3-74-7]

Shlok 8: "Oh, ascetically wealthy lady, perchance your deterrents in ascesis are completely overcome, somehow... 
your ascetic practises culminating, someway... your annoyances and ailments are adjusted, somewhat... 
isn't it! [3-74-8]

[Commentary] The word kaccit is a phatic expression like 'isn't it?' but without question mark, as a statement 
of reasoning out as in hai naa, hai kyaa.../ illeyaa.../ kadaa... But it had to be said here 
in a roundabout way. The detrimental factors for loosing balance of mind, as asked by Rama, are 
kaama, krodha, lobha: tri vidham narakasya idam dvaaram naashanam aatmanaH | kaamaH krodhaH tathaa lobhaH 
tasmaat etat trayam tyajet || 16-21 Gita. The Doors of Hell / Are threefold, whereby men to ruin 
pass,- / The door of Lust, the door of Wrath, the door / Of Avarice. Let a man shun those three! - Sir 
E. Arnold.

Shlok 9: "Oh, suave speaker, mayhap your sacred commitments are achieved, anywise... appeased is your self, anyway... 
and your subservience to your mentors brought to fruition, perchance... isn't it!" Thus Rama enquired 
with Shabari. [3-74-9]

Shlok 10: When Rama asked her in this way she that Shabari who is a senescent anchoress, sublimated yogin and 
an adherent to the sublimated yogis of higher rank, informed Rama remaining in his vis-ï¿½-vis. [3-74-10]

Shlok 11: "Just now, on your pleasing manifestation before me my ascesis is accomplished, and now only my birth 
is fructified, and now only my subservience to my mentors is well hallowed... [3-74-11]

[Commentary] Annex: 'My dear boy, you are so late... having come too lately how is that you ask whether everything 
is sanctified or beatified long back and there is nothing for you to do... here I am too bored to stay 
in this withered body and I am longing to go to my gurus' place to serve them... not that they are in 
need of any maidservant, but I need much to be in their presence as a maidservant... whether you are 
god or no god... that is not my concern... my teachers told me to stay here until your arrival... and 
you have arrived now, so fructified is my teachers' saying... what is the result of subservience to 
teachers... release, deliverance, etc., thus my teachers said... so I got it just now... that way, what 
is it a commoner birthed on earth wishes... an emancipation from the cycle of births and deaths... so 
my teachers said... thus I got it just now... on envisioning you... I know that you are unknowable, 
thus said my teachers, but I have known you, because I have seen you... hence I am redeemed by my gurus... 
this is the resultant factor of my unswerving servitude to my teachers... by the way, my teachers used 
to say about it quoting from some sweta Upanishad... now I am unable to recollect it... Lakshmana, 
can you recite it for me...' Lakshmana: yasya deve paraa bhaktiH yathaa deve tathaa gurau | tasya 
ete kathitaa hi arthaaH prakaashante mahaatmaaH |prakaashante mahaatmana iti | shvetaashvataropanishad 
6-23 'for a noble soul who reposes devotion in god, and an equal devotion in his teacher, to such 
a noble soul all truths manifests themselves... to such a noble soul all truths manifests themselves...' 
Shabari: Yes, yes, so also I stand ennobled after envisaging you, just now...'

Shlok 12: "Oh, best one among men, now all my ascesis is fructified when I personally worshiped you, who are none 
other than the best god among gods, thus the heaven will also be there for me... [3-74-12]

[Commentary] Annex: 'thus my teachers were discussing about you when you were in Chitrakuta... but I have no knowledge 
about you or your Being... as said by my teachers you have come, thus my teachers' words came true... 
then you must be that 'Being' according to my feminine logic... and I could personally see you with 
theses hazy, foggy mortal eyes, which my teachers could not... am I to self-ascertain that I edge over 
my teachers, though I have not performed any rituals or ceremonies, which my decrepit and doddering 
teachers painfully did... not so, it is their way of knowing you and this my way of reaching you... 
they also said that there is a returnless sphere, apart from brahma loka, indra loka... 'abode 
of Brahma or paradise of Indra...' and when I was saying 'heaven to me...' I intended that returnless 
'heaven...' to where my teachers have gone, as they did not wish to go to Indra's paradise to enjoy 
the dance programs of Rambha or Tilottama, as said by Gita 8-16: aabrahma bhuvana lokaaH punar aavartino 
arjuna | maam upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate || The worlds, Arjuna!- even Brahma's world- 
/ Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest; / But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me, / Taste 
birth no more. - Sir E. Arnold.

Shlok 13: "Oh, kind one, your blessed sight has sanctified me... and oh, endower of respect, by your beneficence 
I wish to go to those returnless worlds because I have subjugated those enemies of yours, viz.,
ari SaD varga-s in me, and I think my prayer to you is justified because 
you are a subjugator of such enemies... [3-74-13]

[Commentary] Annex: 'Now that you have come I conclude you to be that "Absolute' and I repose the same faith and 
confidence in you which I have for my mentors... hence give me the worlds of no return, to where my 
preceptors went...' 'Or, tava saumyena cakshuSaa by your magnanimous visual acuity, gratis 
visualis, puutaa asmi I am depurated of all of my three fates, sancita, aagaami, praarabdha 
karma-s, hence, oh, enemy subjugator, subdue all enemies in me, ari SaD varga - kaama, krodha, 
lobha, moha, mada, maastarya, even the present lobha, moha for a returnless world, and 
then tvat prasaadaat by your grace; nirhetuka dayaa kaTaaksha prasaadaat, your unconditional 
salvation, salvas gratis, grant me those returnless worlds...' Govindaraja. Ravana's ten heads are identified 
with the above six negativities plus four more as - kama  lust; krodha  anger;
lobha greed; moha  delusion; mada  pride; maatsarya : envy; 
manas : mind; buddhi intellect; chitta  will; ahamkara  ego.

Shlok 14: "Divine aircrafts of unequalled refulgence have lifted those disciples of Sage Matanga in whose tendance 
I was, to welkin on your arriving at Chitrakuta... [3-74-14]

Shlok 15: "Those knowers of probity, highly providential, and eminent-saints have told me, 'Rama will come to 
this highly blest hermitage of yours along with Soumitri... and you have to cordially welcome them as 
your guests, and on your seeing him you will go to best worlds, where merit remains undiminished...' 
[3-74-15, 16]

[Commentary] This suggests that subservience to preceptors will generate the merit that causes deliverance to the 
student or servant by the active participation of the deliverer. The best world or sphere, or state 
attainable by soul-searching individuals is kaivalya whereas seeing that deliverer with one's 
own eyes bhagavad avalokana, is far beyond these worlds or states with nomenclature, and it 
is mukti, salvation from life cycles. Govindaraja

Shlok 17: "Oh, best one among men Rama, thus I was told by those highly providential sages, oh, best one among 
men, oh, manly tiger, and I have gleaned various forest fruits and eatables that occur on the moorlands 
of Pampa Lake for your sake..." So said Shabari to Rama. [3-74-17]

[Commentary] Out of the three epithets for Rama, the twice-repeated epithet is puruSarSabha has two different 
meanings in vernacular translations. One is the usual intensifier puruSa R^iSabha 'bull among 
men...' where The Bull is the bull from the zodiacal sign or constellation Taurus to that of stock exchanges. 
And it is Latin bulla 'rounded object', in medieval Latin 'seal' or Latin bullire 'to bubble', from 
bulla 'bubble' etc., where Rama is the rounded off seal for kingship, and even known for his bubbly 
fermentation to deal with atrocities. The other is puruSa tilaka 'the vermilion mark one the 
forehead of mankind...' rather the husband of mankind, or the husbandman for mankind who cultivates 
good on the earth as a farmer, after weeding out the weeds called evils. The version of Gita Press has 
this as the 'flower of humanity...'

[Commentary] And then it is said in vernacular translations as a 'bullish man' is for his impetuousness and aggressiveness 
towards evil called Ravana, when he started from Ayodhya. The second is to tell that he is a yeoman, 
a man holding and cultivating a small landed estate, taking care of every weed or withering plant, as 
he has come to see Shabari, and Shabari like an old plant did not stir out. The third is puruSa 
vyaaghra 'manly tiger...' but this is actually 'man, the lion...' and if a lion sets out he will 
not take a back step until his pursuit is fulfilled. Thus Shabari is given the lines with three epithets 
to Rama, as she is already in the know of this Rama, and now on seeing him personally, some divine wisdom 
dawned and she is able to foresee what this man, rather this lion, is going to achieve at end point. 
We glean these meanings, one, or two, and we appeal to Sanskrit pundits to derive which epithet is used 
with which purpose, once again.

[Commentary] By the way, where is the scene of Rama eating fruits and eatables bitten and tasted by Shabari? Has 
this old woman not offered the fruits to the guests, or just said that they are available? We listen 
many stories and see many pictures telling that she gave many fruits after biting them with her own 
teeth to test the taste. All that is not in Valmiki Ramayana. This amplification is from Padma Purana.
phalaani ca supakvaani muulaani madhuraaNi ca | svayam aasaadya maadhuryam pariikShya paribhakShya 
ca | pashcaat nivedayaamaasa raaghaabhyaam dhR^iDhvrataa |

Shlok 18b- 19a: When that graceful souled Rama is addressed thus by Shabari, he that Raghava enquiringly said this to 
that Shabari who is never ever debarred from esoteric knowledge and gnosis. [3-74-18b, 19a]

[Commentary] 'though ignoble by birth...' is the assumed finishing line. There are many exclamations and arguments 
for and against this caste oriented banalities. So taking by those days we may find the characters of 
this Shabari, tribal king Guha, Dasharatha's minister Sumantra, and the like and then we may examine 
how much the so-called outcaste is cared for or sought after. They may be ineligible to perform ritual 
deeds but none is barred from esoteric knowledge.

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Your and your preceptors' effectiveness is heard in effect from the wraith of the great souled Danu's 
son, Kabandha, and if you feel showing it like I wish to clearly see it, personally..." Thus Rama asked 
her to show hermitage. [3-74-19b, 20a]

[Commentary] He is rather showing that hermitage to us in order to emphasise the path followed by the disciples of 
Matanga, whom this Shabari served that laboriously.

Shlok 20b- 21a: On hearing those words voiced by Rama, Shabari started to show that unique woodland to both of them. 
[3-74-20]

Shlok 21b-22: "Oh, Rama the delight of Raghu's lineage... this one comparable to a crammed cloud that would be ever 
ready to yield much cherished cloudbursts, and compacted with animals and birds that are ever ready 
to enjoy seasonable rains, is that hermitage to which you have come, that way this woodland is well 
known as Matanga, meaning a cloud, or an elephant, or an elephantine cloud that showers blessings on 
all... and oh, highly resplendent Rama, you may see this nest, snuggery, where those contemplative souls, 
my teachers, used to conduct oblations into the Ritual-fires, orienting and worshipping them with Vedic 
hymns... [3-74-21b, 22]

[Commentary] There is another shade with a little different wording cakruH analam mantravat mantra kovidaaH 
meaning mantra kovidaaH experts in hymns; mantravat hymn oriented; analam 
Ritual-fire; juhaavaan oblations in fire; cakruH conducted, worshipped.

Shlok 23: "Where those great sages that are highly revered by me used to offer flowers with their extremely doddery 
hands in the worship the Altar of Fire, this alone is that Altar of Fire raised at western end... [3-74-23]

[Commentary] The Altar of Fire is the sanctum sanctorum of Vedic-ritual, like that of present day temples. It took 
some two hours for Rama to enter such a hermitage of Agastya, that too after Agastya's permission. Now 
a so-called low-caste woman is able to detail about it, naming by their technical names as pratyak 
stalii vedi, praacii sthalii vedi, puSpopahaaram, and she is detailing their acts of doddery worship, 
sympathetically. Hence, she should be in proximity at those places when her preceptors actually worshipped 
the fire offerings. That way, she is a bahiSkR^itaam - api samiipaat ' not, debarred lady, 
even, from the proximity' of Vedic-rituals. These Vedic time yanGYa-s were more secular than 
the present day commercial temple complexes, cf., ashva medha yaGYa in Bala Kanda. Nobody debars 
any in such Vedic ceremonies, but some are not expected to perform them personally, again cf., Vishvamitra-Trishanku 
episodes. If everybody becomes a Bishop, who will be remaining for appointment as pastoral staff? The 
Reverend Bishop is the Bishop, but staffers are many.

Shlok 24: "Oh, best one from Raghu-s, by the efficacy of the ascesis of my teachers these Altars of Fire are with 
incomparable irradiance, and even now they are irradiating all of the directions with solemnity... see 
them... [3-74-24]

Shlok 25: "Enervated by dieting and straining they were incapable to go for sea bathing, and just at their thought 
process all the seven seas came close by, in coalescence... see them... [3-74-25]

[Commentary] That is why Pampa Lake is held sacred. Instead of rivers going into sea, seas flowed back to form this 
lake for the sake of these old sages. Sea bathing is the best, river bathing is of medium merit, and 
bathing with well or vessel water is worst, in terms of holy baths.

Shlok 26: "On performing holy baths those sages have spread their jute cloths on those trees with their own doddering 
hands here at this place and oh, Raghu's legatee, those cloths did not dry even now by the touch of 
their hands... [3-74-26]

Shlok 27: "Which garlands they have knotted together with black-lotuses and other flowers while they were worshiping 
gods, these are really those garlands, and indeed there is no discolouration to them... [3-74-27]

Shlok 28: "You have seen what is seeable and you have listened what is listenable of this woodland in its entirety... 
thereby I wish to become a permittee, where you alone are my permitter, as I wish to castaway this sheathe 
of soul, called my body... to make that soul to move nigh of my teachers feet... [3-74-28]

Shlok 29: "Of which sages this hermitage is, and of which sages I am also a maidservant, I soulfully go the proximity 
of those contemplative souls..." Thus, she appealed to Rama. [3-74-29]

Shlok 30: Rama on hearing those duty-congruous words of Shabari along with Lakshmana, obtained a uniquely high 
rejoice and he also said, "astonishing is this..." [3-74-30]

[Commentary] Annex: 'astonishing is this hermitage and its inmates... where the inmates praise their bygone masters, 
as said at gurum prakaashayet dhiimaan 'gurus are to be extolled by true and wise disciples...' 
and the masters made the environ blissfully livable, all this is without any maya or magic... so, fairness 
has its own place...'

Shlok 31: Then Rama spoke to that Shabari who is firmed up in her faith towards her masters, "oh, saintly lady, 
you treated me with deference... thus may go to your cherished worlds, where you can solace yourself 
with your masters... [3-74-31]

Shlok 32- 33a: Thus that way said by Rama in consent, she who is wearing tufty-matted hair, jute-cloths, and deerskin 
as her clothing, she offered herself as an oblation into Ritual-fire, and then like a flaring fire, 
she went to heaven alone. [3-74-32, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34: Now she appeared as an angle bejewelled with angelic ornaments, wearing angle's wraparound and angelical 
flowery tassels, and bedaubed with suchlike cosmetics, and as with the scintillations of electric sparks 
she scintillated that province. [3-74-33b, 34]

Shlok 35: Shabari who is a perfect yogin with perfected meditative concentration, now went to that sanctum locus 
where the blest souls of those sublime sages, namely her masters, saunter. [3-74-35]

[Commentary] For this Dharmaakuutam says: tat udiiritam ati dharmiShTham vacanam aakarNya harSha nirbhara maanaso 
raameNa samauGYaataa shavarii bhujagii iva jiirNaam tvacaam tanum hutaashane nikShipya divya maalyaa 
ambara dharaa shirasaa raamam praNamya guru jana maNDala kR^itam puNya sthalam jagaama || dk She 
left her body as a female serpent does in its ecdysis. This metaphor of a snake shedding off skin is 
repeated time and again in Ramayana and here the commentator is using it. This is indicative of the 
thousand hooded serpent aadiseSa who guards Vishnu like a mosquito net. The fibre like sheath 
released by a snake will be beautiful for a look as it glitters with all the charms of a charming snake. 
The minute you finger it, of course when snake went a long way off, then that sheath splinters in hundreds 
of pieces. That is why this metaphor is used to suggest the world as viSNu maya, which remains 
beautiful and if touched shatters all misconceptions. Saint-singer Tyaagaraaya has a kR^iti 
on this pannagapu doma tera paikettavemayyaâ¦ So Shabari is rid of that illusion, or mayaâ¦

[Commentary] At the outset let us say that there is no Hinduism as such but bhaaratiiya sanskR^iti is there, 
and that is not concentrated in an around Indus valley alone. So also there is no caste system in India, 
but it is to be called varNa, varga categorisation, class, social stratification etc. Oxford 
has this to say for the word caste - Spanish and Portuguese casta 'lineage, race, breed', fem. of casto 
'pure, chaste' and we are still lingering ourselves to the unwitting misnomer of Portuguese. In Ch. 
1 of Bala Kanda, we put this as - Brahman - teacher-class; Kshatriya - ruler-class; Vyshya - trader-class; 
Shudra - worker-class. And if the word 'class' is also a pungent word let us use this Latin word 
classis 'assembly...' a near relative of varNa, varga and which does not mean the colour 
of skin, but it is meant to be a group. Thus the groups or assemblages are classis of intelligentsia 
and classis of sovereignty and classis of commerce and classis of peasantry or 
smithery or its various branches. Unfortunately, this word is mixed up to mean nonsense, and it 
remained to mean only as 'casta' of Portuguese. If it were to mean bloodline, race, or caste, then to 
which bloodline Kshatriya-s belong, either to Solar dynasty or to Lunar dynasty. Likewise to which bloodline 
the many kinds of Brahmans, say Vaidic, Niyogi, Bhatt, Caturvedi, Dwivedi, Iyer, Iyyangar, Namboodri 
etc., belong. By the way, what is the caste of Parashu Rama, or Bhaargava Rama, the sixth incarnation 
of Vishnu on earth and generally ascribed as a Brahman? His father is Jamadagni, said to be a Brahman, 
and his mother is Satyavati, the sister of Vishvamitra, a Kshatriya. Thus, the present day confusion 
and wrong terminology do not apply to Vedic times, because they believed in the 'seed-and-field syndrome'
biija kshetra nyaaya and perhaps a phenomenon recently found may match it - ``when we look 
at the Y-chromosome DNA, we see a very different pattern. The lower castes are most similar to Asians, 
and the upper castes are more European than Asian... Further, when we look at the different components 
within the upper caste, the group with the greatest European similarity of all is the warrior class, 
the Kshatriya, who are still at the top of the Hindu castes, with the Brahmins... But the Brahmins, 
in terms of their Y-chromosomes, are a little bit more Asian - So the genetic results are consistent 
with historical accounts that women sometimes marry into higher caste, resulting in female gene flow 
between adjacent castes. In contrast, males seldom change castes, so Y chromosome'' so says geneticist 
Lynn Jorde of the University of Utah.

[Commentary] This discussion has its orientation in the word shramaNii prefixed to Shabari, which originally 
means a Hindu wandering friar, not to be confused with the monk of Buddhism. Many take her to be a tribal 
or lowborn woman, and puzzle about the availability of Vedic knowledge or yogic practise to her. It 
is pertinent to ask why lowborn people and women were not authorised to perform Vedic rituals. We may 
see the queens of Dasharatha have performed Ashvamedha ritual in Bala Kanda. So women are not barred. 
Then the classis laboris had a different kind of labour to undertake, than this relax -less 
labour of rituals. So, their manpower was used that way and the brainpower of these Vedic pundits was 
used this way. The difference belonged more to the occupational interests than congenital inheritance. 
The lateral thinking or the vertical thinking changed them, and it is now we have a counter-culture 
than that of Vedic times. We still see sons and daughter of film actors, industrialists, or politicians 
becoming father-like, but sons of washermen and shore-makers are turning out differently.

[Commentary] Though Shabari is given a direct charge-free flight to heaven but poor Shambuka, another shuudra, is 
eliminated by Rama. Shambuka is neither a poor, innocent, meekish shuudra. He had to be eliminated when 
he was practising haTha yoga 'meditating upside down...' only to conquer the world with his 
negative logic like Ravana. He is not even a Yogi, but a bhogi, enjoyer and one who started 
his mission with half-knowledge with para apakaara dharma. But Shabari is a yogin by her
aatma samaadhi, that too a reverential lady by her steadfastness in what she believed sva 
dharma.

[Commentary] Regarding the accessibility of Vedas or Vedic knowledge to each and every body, the first question that 
arises is 'what for it is required by everyone?' If the answer is 'to know what Vedas say...' then the 
reply is, 'sun rises in east, cloud brings rain, so it is to be worshipped, and beyond it there are 
some forces to cause all this, so they are to be known, by which you obtain heaven... this Vedas say...' 
Therefore, this knowledge was unnecessary for the commoners in those days, because they were on heaven-like 
earth, so we presume by epics. And there are no such episodes where such questions were raised by some 
characters. Even Vali, a vanara was an adherer of Veda-s. This knowledge is now sought for because earth 
is turning into hell. But if Vedas are required for practising to purchase a direct ticket to heaven, 
the episode of Trishanku is there to tell us what sort of heaven we gain by short-cut methods. Even 
if they are taught to one and all and all sit chanting those hymns, since it appears to be an easy job 
to chant un-understandable hymns, gone is the agriculture, commerce, defence etc., to dogs.

[Commentary] Such a state of turmoil has occurred with the advent of Buddhism and its relative conversions. Then 
the Magadha and Maurya empires have utterly outdone the Kshatriya-s, by hiring mercenaries as their 
army. When the defence of a tradition itself is defeated then that tradition had to crumble, and in 
to that crumbling tradition, many outlandish traditions have intruded to intermingle, so says our known 
history. But when the question of - caste vs. Vedas - arises, there are many caste-less characters in 
Veda made eligible to learn Vedas, for e.g., Jaabaala Satyakaama, vide channdogya upaishad 
4-4-1 to 4-4-5. Adi Shankara's commentary on Brahma sutra-s 34-38 refuses the right of practising Vedas 
by Shudra-s, but his maniiSaa pancakam salutes a caNDaala - caNDaalo astu sa tu dvijostu... 
'may he be a Brahman or a Profaner, salute him [who has right knowledge about the Absolute...] This 
appears self-contradictory, but not so, because the ritual acts are prohibitive to women and shuudra-s, 
but not knowledge or personal excellence in it. Admittance of everyone in every sphere of activity is 
as good as admitting a nondescript into an operation theatre when heart transplantation is going on. 
Or, asking an airhostess to build a space shuttle because she has more flight hours on her record. Why 
all of them, some categories of Brahmans are not allowed in certain areas of rituals though conducted 
by Brahmans. Vedas say that it is a difficult path to follow them: uttiShTha jaagrata praapya varaan 
nibodhata | kShurasya dhaaraa nishitaa dur atyayaa duram pathaH tat kavayo vayanti || 1-3-14 kaThopaishad 
'Arise Awake, resort to best teachers to know 'That...' it is a walk on the razor's edge, difficult 
to follow, so the wise say...' then, why walk on a razor blade when air-conditioned roads of VB, Java, 
C , Oracle are there, like Vishvamitra who has taken many chapters to become Brahmin pundit, for no 
practical purpose. Vedic culture is different to Puranic culture, Puranic culture differs with epical, 
where examples are Lakshmana's boundary line to Seetha, and Shabari's tasting fruits before giving them 
to Rama, from Padma Purana, and everything or anything of that time is unavailable now, except these 
palm-leaf books and this pseudo-casteism. Anyway, let bygones be bygones, and let Veda or Vedic knowledge 
remain in a showcase of some archaeological museum, and let us revert to the story telling. So in conclusion 
it is to be said whether Shabari is the Spanish casto lady or Indian shramaNi she got what 
she wanted by her own sva dharma , and the portrayal of her divinity in the last but one verse 
is enough to tell whether she is lowborn human, or high-rising angle.

[Commentary] Though we may not elicit the caste, creed, or classis of Shabari, but she is an important Yogic character 
according the viewpoint of Yoga on Ramayana. In Yoga kunDalini 'the cosmic power in living 
being...' has a good part to play. It flows though the Sympathetic and Para-sympathetic ganglions though 
bio plexuses. If we take Ramayana as a humanoid epic, and the gist of the epic as its life force, that 
force has an upward movement via these ganglions. By the boons of Kaika this Ã©lan vital of Ramayana 
has moved from its serpentine coil reposing in muula aadhaara cakra sacro-coccygeal plexus, 
and reaches svaadhiSTaana cakra sacral plexus, when Bharata takes Rama's sandals to enthrone, 
and then it ascends and spends time in maNipuuraka cakra, the lumbar plexus, in the solacing 
laps of great saints and hermits like Atri, Anasuya, Agastya, and then it ascends and listens to the 
noise made by Kabandha at anaahata cakra cardiac plexus, where an aahata is 'un beaten...' 
a sound made without any external beating, the lub-dub beating of heart. That noise of heart will be 
unbearably noisy for cardiac patients. So is the thunderous voicing of Kabandha on his entry. This Ã©lan 
vital of Ramayana, which started with its primeval pureness, touches water and fire in earlier plexuses 
and now is ready to touch air at cardiac plexus. And air wants an egress and the story wants to go to 
the next plexus vi shuddha cakra 'very clean, pure, friendly and pleasant area...' laryngeal 
plexus, that of clean Pampa, pure vanara-s, friendly Sugreeva, Hanuma, and pleasant Rishyamuka. But 
where is outlet for that agonised 'airing of heart' of the epic? Frail Shabari is that slender duct-stem 
of a lotus, and through her, viz., on exiting her, the story enters into an area where the problems 
of the characters can be explained to other characters. Having spent some time there, then it enters
aaGYaa cakra the ordering plexus in between brows. One does what his mind orders. Here that 
mind is Sugreeva and irrefutable are his orders. When vishuddha cakra is available at throat,
svaadhiSTaana cakra is there at sacral place. The area from throat to sacrum is madhya 
kuuTa Vali's birth is from this place and Sugreeva's birth is from throat of their father turned 
mother. And what that is throated by Sugreeva is the activity of aaGYaa cakra and Seetha is 
found thereby... - after raamayaNa paramaartham by Dr. Ilapaavuluuri Panduranga Rao, a T.T.D 
publication.



SARGA 75
------------------------------

[Text] Rama arrives at the auspicious Pampa Lake according to the suggestion of Kabandha. On seeing that pious 
environ of that lake Rama has a breather and he expects some good to happen now. On further beholding 
the ladylike Pampa Lake, his thoughts move to Seetha, and he is again dispirited. However, on overcoming 
that short spell of his anguish, he proceeds with Lakshmana to the nearby of the lake.

Shlok 1: While Shabari ascended to heaven with her own divine self-resplendence, Raghava who is with Lakshmana 
started to cogitate over the magnificence of Matanga disciples. [3-75-1]

Shlok 2: That noble-souled Raghava on thinking about the efficacy of the disciples of Matanga, said to Lakshmana, 
who is the maintainer of Rama's well being, and who is thinking single-mindedly. [3-75-2]

[Commentary] Rama's thinking is that 'I happened to see a lady of unswerving loyalty to her teachers, by which adoration 
alone she is going to her desired worlds, and seeing such pious people will definitely yield good results 
from now on... hence some good shall betide us for we could have a glimpse of pious place and person 
puNya sthala, puNya purusa, puNya aatma sandarshana...'  and Lakshmana thinking is 'this lady has served 
her teachers with such a devotion by which she is going to the heavens she desired, where placements 
in heavens will usually be determined by their relative merits... am I serving my brother, teacher, 
god, and the like... namely Rama, to have an iota of Shabari's merit... or, all the problems to Rama 
have chanced by my neglect of my duty...'

Shlok 3: "I have seen a highly astounding hermitage of self-controlled sages, oh, gentle Lakshmana, in which 
the deer and tigers are at home, and which is adored by divers birds... [3-75-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, Lakshmana, holy is our taking a bath in this holy Pampa Lake, for it is formed by the waters of 
seven seas, and even holier is our oblation of this holy waters to manes... [3-75-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "What that was unpropitious for us is completely abated by our holy bath and holy oblations, oh, Lakshmana, 
propitiousness is standing en face us, thereby presently this heart of mine is highly gladdening... 
oh, lion-like man, indeed, heart alone hatches hope... [3-75-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7-8a: "Thereby, where Mt. Rishyamuka is beaming forth at its nearby, on which that right minded son of the 
Sun, Sugreeva, is living along with four other vanara-s, always frightened by the fear from Vali, we 
will go to her, to that spectacular Lake Pampa, come on, Lakshmana... [3-75-6b, 7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "I am also hasty to see that best one among vanara-s, Sugreeva, for my enterprise called search for 
Seetha is under his aegis, isn't it... [3-75-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: To that brave Rama who is speaking thus, Soumitri said this, " my heart too is hastening me, let us 
go there promptly..." [3-75-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Then that Lord of People and Lord of Nature on exiting from that hermitage, he then came nigh of Lake 
Pampa along with Lakshmana. [3-75-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12- 13: Rama on scrutinising that rosy woodland in which everywhere there are outsized and diverse trees that 
are thickset with flowers, and different lakes loaded with the trilling birds like plovers, peacocks, 
waterfowls and suchlike, with which that woodland itself is trilling in much ado, became impassioned 
as he is instantly rendered thus by Love-god, and thus that Rama went towards that lovely Lake Pampa. 
[3-75-11b, 12, 13]

[Commentary] Vividly: The pronoun saH  is continuously repeated word denoting 'such as he is...' when used as opening 
word in first foot, as used in next verse, until the first verse of next canto. This expression, 'such 
as he is' is to take us back to the olden days when Seetha was found missing and to remind us about 
his problems from then on. So the above verse is to be said like this: 'Rama who is so far accustomed 
to see only blood, wraiths, revenants, and souls is fed up and - such as he is, - he has seen a picturesque 
lake with a backdrop of pristine nature, and with the background music of trilling birds and rustling 
waters, then his innate need for visualising Seetha sprang up and he rushed towards lovely Lake of Pampa 
presuming her to be Lady Seetha...' but we usually take liberty to cut off other words and retain 'he' 
for pain of retyping.

Shlok 14: Rama spotted Pampa Lake from a distance which is plethoric with water, but entered into a lake called 
Matanga Lake on his way to Pampa... [3-75-14]

[Commentary] From here the real confusion about the arrangement of verses occurs, which is ascribed to the wrong 
copying of copyists. No two versions agree on the placement of verses and some from the next canto Kishkindha 
are also brought in here. With the result parsing of verses also goes wrong. Yet, this goes on.

Shlok 15: Though both Raghava-s came there composedly and dispassionately, but Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is 
ensorcelled by anguish on seeing a ladylike lake Pampa. [3-75-15]

Shlok 16: Rama entered the area of that beautiful lake which is beaming forth with lotuses hemming in from inside, 
and trees like Tilaka, Ashoka, Punnaga, Bakula, Uddala, are hemming it from outside. [3-75-16]

Shlok 17: That lake is huddled with delightful fringe lands and lotuses squeeze it from within, and its water 
is plethoric and crystalline, and its sand is softish all over. [3-75-17]

Shlok 18: That lake is beautified with packs of fishes and tortoises, and packs of trees on its banks, on which 
climber plants are wraparound like the ladyloves of those trees. [3-75-18]

Shlok 19: And that is adored by the beings like sylvan, reptilian, celestial, georgic, and elfish beings, and 
it is overcrowded with trees and tendrils, and it is a trove for fairish and clodish water. [3-75-19]

Shlok 20- 21: The lotuses of the lake are rich in their fragrance, and with the heaps of clusters of reddish, whitish, 
and blackish lotuses, and with such pinkish, whitish, and reddish lotuses the sheet of water is like 
a picturesquely painted canvas and it is surrounded by the orchards of flowered mango trees and sounded 
much by the screams of peacocks. [3-75-20, 21]

[Commentary] Two words used in the verses here udghaaTa a heap of things, which now became 'a public speech 
or lecture' and the other kuthaa detailed as above are said to be rare Sanskrit words in the 
book: 'Apart from kutha the verse quoted above contains one more word which unlike kutha 
is not noticed by Monier Williams in the sense in which it is used in Ramayana. This word is udghaaTa. 
It means a heap samuuha. This meaning of the word is very rare...' according to the book - 
Ramayana - A Linguistic Study, by Pt. Satya Vrata.

Shlok 22: Then Rama along with Lakshmana on seeing at that Pampa Lake, that self-refulgent son of Dasharatha whimpered 
over, owing to his passionate recollection of Seetha. [3-75-22]

Shlok 23- 24: That Pampa Lake is wraparound with the trees of Tilaka, Citron-fruits, Banyan, White-trees, likewise 
flowered are flowery trees like Red oleanders, Punnaaga, shrubs of Maalati and Kunda, likewise flowered 
are the trees of Madder, Nicula, Ashoka, and Seven-leaved banana plants, and plants of Mogra and climbers 
of Maadhavii Lata are also flowered, and with them she that Ladylike Pampa shone forth like a pulchritudinous 
lady. [3-75-23, 24]

[Commentary] From now until the end of first chapter of Kishkindha with a hundred couplets, we will be entering into 
the beauty of the nature. Poetics require romantic exaltation of nature, as usual,
varNana aatmakam kavitvam. Rama as Mr. Green extols it with his own tongue. 
The commentators are very much enthused by this verbal picturing of Valmiki and they have rendered more 
complex and beautiful compounds for the same verses. Why commentators, Mahaakavi Kaalidas is tempted 
to rewrite Ramayana, but he refrained to do so, because he cannot possibly tell Ramayana in such a simple 
language of Valmiki. Hence, Kalidas gave it up and embarked on to write another master piece
Raghu Vamsham, tradition says so. Let us touch Dharmaakuutam, which has 
many such complexly constructed compounds in Ch. 1 of Kishkindha, and one is brought here for this lady 
called Lake Pampa, for the reading pleasure our readers.

[Commentary] of which lalanaa iva 'a beautiful lady like...' is our concern.

Shlok 25b-26a: The aforesaid mountain renowned as Rishyamuka which is abounding with colourful ores and amazingly flowered 
trees is there on the bank of Pampa Lake. [3-75-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27b: A noble soul by his name Risharaja was there and that monkey's son is the highly valiant Sugreeva, thus 
he is renowned, and he presides over that mountain. [3-75-26b, 27b]

Shlok 27b- 28: That best one among men Rama, said this way, "oh, Lakshmana, you make a headway for that chief of monkeys, 
Sugreeva..." and further said this to Lakshmana whose valiance is truthfulness alone, "how can I possibly 
live without Seetha..." [3-75-27b, 28]

[Commentary] There is a filler foot in the above verses raajya bhraSTen diinena tasyaam aakskta cetasaa

In view of mishmashed editing of verses even the critical edition has no perfect order of verses, leave 
alone ancient copies.

Shlok 29: Such as he is whose thinking is applying itself to Seetha alone, and who is vocalising his anguish for 
her, to whom aa stymie is laid by the Love-god just at the appearance that lake, that Rama on saying 
that sentence in that way to Lakshmana neared that superb and heart delighting lotus Lake Pampa. [3-75-29]

Shlok 30: On going step by step, and on going on seeing ardently and intently at that forest which has picturesque 
visuals of forestry, and which is with hurly-burly birds, not one, but numerous and divers are they, 
and then Rama along with Lakshmana on entering the area of that lake, has seen that Lake Pampa. [3-75-30]

KISHKINDA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------

[Translation] Rama in his pursuit to regain Seetha reaches Pampa Lake along with Lakshmana. Rama visualises Pampa 
Lake as a heavenly abode and narrates to Lakshmana the suffering he is undergoing due to the departure 
of Seetha, i.e., the departure of innate soul from the Supreme. Seetha is the alter ego of Rama, either 
in heaven or on earth. In heavens she is Goddess Lakshmi and she incarnates herself as Seetha on earth. 
In the first chapter of Kishkindha Kanda the elaborate description of Pampa Lake and its surroundings 
is to be taken as a two-fold narration, one pertaining to Divinity, the other to Rama, the human. The 
area of Pampa Lake metaphors with heavens, and its trees and birds with divine souls, and who incidentally 
are teachers too. The fragrant breeze metaphors with god's gift, flowers as pure knowers and knowledge, 
and the tranquil water as clear heart and so on. Rama as hero of the epic is in search of Seetha. Rama 
as god incarnate is also in search of true devotees who are entrapped in the bodies of living beings. 
The true devotees are the trees, birds, flowers, waters and other naturals except the humans who cherish 
the earthly comforts. Thus Rama's sorrowing over Seetha and Bharata is in similitude with the god's 
sorrowing for the true devotees, who needs salvation from the birth and death cycle. Hence the god incarnate 
Rama is in search of true devotee like Seetha, who is now in a distant place and needs some education 
about her release from the embodiment in Lanka. Later Rama finds Hanuma, the teacher, who will be deputed, 
to Seetha to enlighten her about her release. In the last two chapters of Aranya Kanda there will be 
some 61 verses detailing about Pampa Lake and Rama's love for Seetha. But in Gorakhpur and Eastern recessions 
there are 130 verses in this first canto of Kishkindha and some 20 verses in the fag end chapter of 
Aranya canto. In these many verses Rama expresses his deep-rooted emotion for Seetha, which the ancient 
commentators have interpreted to be the God's deep-seated love and anguish for the created souls. The 
comparison is, Rama to Vishnu, Seetha to the created soul, now captivated in the embodiment called Lanka, 
and Lakshmana as the true devout. God needs a messenger or a Messiah or as per Hindu tradition the Guru, 
the teacher. That is what Hanuma. Rama as a god incarnate is actually in search of a true teacher, for 
which the surroundings of Pampa Lake are exemplified as good surroundings for finding such a true teacher. 
As far as possible, the commentaries of ancients are given in comment section of those verses. At the 
fag end of this chapter, the mighty monkey hero Sugreeva, moving on the Rishyamuka Mountain sees Rama 
and Lakshmana entering into his territory, flees into deep forests, fearing them to be enemies.

Shlok 2: Rama, on arriving at that Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, which is full with lotuses, 
costuses, and fishes, lamented as his emotions are disturbed, on seeing the beauty of the Lake comparable 
with Seetha's face. [4-1-1]

[Commentary] In this very first verse itself the auspicious nature of the land of Kishkindha is implanted. Rama as 
hero of this epic identifies his heroine Seetha's face with the tranquil sheet of lake's water, her 
eyes with the lotuses, and her quick glances with the quick swims of the fishes in the lake. Rama as 
god incarnate observes the tranquil sheet of water as the quiescence of his creation. The red lotuses 
are meditatively standing, as the devotees ready to be taken away to the feet of their god. The swimming 
fishes are seen as the souls captivated in human bodies, rushing hither and thither for salvation, which 
is hindered by the banks of life [here the banks of the lake.] Thus on certain occasions we chance to 
meet with the different points of view of Rama, one as hero and the other as god incarnate, derived 
from the metaphors or similes by the ancient commentators.

Shlok 3: There, on seeing that Lake of Lotuses, thrilled are his senses with gladness, and he engrossed and overcame 
by passion spoke this way to Lakshmana. [4-1-2]

Shlok 4: "Oh! Soumitri, magnificent is Pampa Lake with its cat's-eye-gem like waters, and she with her fully 
bloomed lotuses and costuses is beaming forth, along with many trees around her. [3-1-3]

[Commentary] The clear water is devout-soul and the bloomed lotuses are the tranquil faces of the devotees. The water 
is like cat's eye gem. Cat's eye or Lapis Lazuli is ' a beautiful stone consisting of calcite and other 
minerals coloured ultramarine...' and a precious stone of Sri Lanka and the Malabar Coast...' thus say 
Chambers and Oxford dictionaries, and it is Indian, that too South Indian specific. It is one of the 
nine gems, in nava-ratna combination.

[Commentary] Secondly the usage of vaiduurya vimala udaka is an often-repeated expression, which may not 
be construed only that the waters are like cats-eye or Lapis Lazule, the precious gem in nava ratna/ 
nine-gem combination. In fine composition it is smaraNa alankaara , a metaphorical memorabilia. 
If it were said that the water is like vaiduurya or cat's-eye or Lapis, it reminds us of all 
other eight gems including a diamond. As such the waters are crystalline and pellucid in their look 
like priceless gems, for water is the invaluable gem-like gift of nature and flowing waters are the 
priceless possessions for livelihood as well.

Shlok 5: "Oh! Soumitri, see the forest of Pampa, the auspicious one in its appearance... where the mountains 
or trees lustre with their mountainous peaks... [4-1-4]

[Commentary] The mountainous trees are teachers, and their mountainous branches are the taught, that depend on their 
teachers, and both of they depending upon the Pampa Lake, the divine tranquil water... and everything 
depends on waters, as per Vedic saying: aapovaa idagam sarvam... waters are everything...

Shlok 6: "But I, who am well seethed by the anguish of Bharata, and even by the abduction of Seetha, am indeed 
distressed by my sensibilities and their distresses... [4-1-5]

[Commentary] In some other version like Eastern version the word Maadhava i.e., Love God Manmadha used for aadhayaH 
because the alankaara or the aesthetics demand the description of vasantha requires Manmadha. 
Then the compound is read as santaptam maadhavaH piidayanniva comes there, meaning that 'the 
Vasanta, the spring season, or the personified Manmadha, the Love God, is distressing me, besides the 
problems of anguished Bharata and abduction of Seetha.' It is said that Rama remembers Bharata too, 
along with Seetha at this juncture, because as a god incarnate He remembers the sufferance of these 
innate souls dedicated to Him. Bharata is another kainkarya /dedicatee of Rama, the divine, 
like Lakshmana.

Shlok 7: "This auspicious Pampa is pleasant to me with its delightful forests overspread with many diverse flowers, 
cool waters, though I am disquieted... [4-1-6]

[Commentary] In grief everything is disquieting, duHkhite manasi sarvam asahyam... but these pleasant floral 
environment of Pampa is admirable to Rama, because nature is divine.

Shlok 8: "Even enwreathed with lotuses this is remarkably sacred in its aspect... rambling snakes and elephants 
and restless are the deer and birds flocks, as well... [4-1-7]

[Commentary] Even though serpents etc., are there, the lake with its lotuses is pleasant. This suggests that if a 
wise-one contains a vice, he is not deplorable... teSaam tejo visheSeNa pratyavaayo na vidyate...smriti 
scriptures.

Shlok 9: "All this is shining very much with bluish, yellowish grassland with a variety of trees... and with 
flowers covering it like flowery bed-sheet with variegated colours... [4-1-8]

[Commentary] The green pasturelands have become colourful pastures with variegated flower-fall, means that the a 
mortal soul on receiving many a teaching from many teachers, where the teachers are trees and flowers 
are teachings, that mortal is becoming immortal, and becomes an abode to the Supreme soul.

Shlok 10: "Everywhere the treetops are fully flowered and the onus of those flowers is on the rise, though they 
are wholly embraced by climbers and their apices. [4-1-9]

[Commentary] A householder, though embraced by many flowery desires, will stand out, with his own flowers of wisdom, 
should he be true devotee.

Shlok 11: "Pleasing is this breeze, oh! Soumitri, and Manmadha, the Love God, prevails at this time, and prideful 
is this month with its fragrance, flowers, fruits and trees... all anew... [4-1-10]

[Commentary] The appreciation of nature is said to be of divine nature, for the Divine creates the nature that itself 
is of Divine nature. The high crowned trees are the sessile teachers and the flowers and birds are mobile 
students, who always surround the teachers. Rama in search of some good teacher to convey his message 
to the captive Seetha finds some other great teachers of nature, but whom he cannot utilise for his 
purpose because they are sessile. He however praises them while remembering Seetha. The touch of Cupid 
is for the Rama, the Hero, and the touch of anguish in search of a good teacher is for the god incarnate.

Shlok 12: "See this figuration of these forests enriched with these flowers, Soumitri! Outpouring is the flower 
rain, like the rain from rain-clouds... [4-1-11]

[Commentary] Teachers rain flowers of wisdom like rain from clouds without any seeking.

Shlok 13: "Also on those appeasing terraces of mountains there are many forest trees... speed of winds are swinging 
them to shower flowers onto ground... [4-1-12]

Shlok 14: "These are the flowers already fallen, about to fall, or still on the trees, but everywhere the air 
is playing with these flowers, see that Lakshmana... [4-1-13]

[Commentary] The word patitaH also synonyms with morally fallen. The three states of flowers viz., fallen, 
about to fall and yet to fall are not just for flowers but also for those who are in the same state 
morally. With all of them the god plays in his kriida, liila . Presently god's own attribute, 
namely the Air is playing with them, since air is the suutra , string, the thread of whole 
creation.

Shlok 15: "The honeybees are displaced when the wind rapidly moved numerous branches of trees with full of flowers, 
and though displaced those bees are singing as though in accompaniment to the singing breeze... [4-1-14]

[Commentary] The singing of honeybees or of the air amounts to the chanting of Sama Veda hymns at the sight of Absolute, 
i.e., Rama who now appeared in this environ.

Shlok 16: "Breeze coming out from those mountain caves along with the high callings of lusty black cuckoos are 
making the trees to dance, and the air itself is as though singing as an accompaniment to that dancing... 
[4-1-15]

[Commentary] The kokila is not exactly a cuckoo, for cuckoo gives out a two note call whereas the kokila gives out 
a single lengthy call with up and down of its tone, and also replies its imitative cooing of the humans. 
However it belongs to the same species of cuckoo. Here the 'air itself is singing' has the similitude 
with singing of Sama Veda hymns, which here is coming out of mountain caves, where the caves themselves 
are the abode of the hermits and sages, who sing Sama hymns. Later in the canto the monkey heroes also 
dwell in caves, and are equated with the pre-eminent teaches who always sing in the praise of God, which 
will be as good as singing the Vedic Hymns. Now the air emerging from the caverns of yonder firmaments 
is singing Sama Veda applauding Rama, the Divine.

Shlok 17: "Entwined are the spires of trees when muchly moved by the air, thus the trees themselves seem to be 
entwined one with the other... [4-1-16]

[Commentary] Entwined are the devotees in the devotion of their common Supreme.

Shlok 18: "He, this breeze is thus a happy one for touch, carrying a coolant and the fragrance like that of the 
sandalwood, and this breezing is a merited one and a fatigue remover... [4-1-17]

[Commentary] The fragrance gandha always synonyms with puNya merit. A flower emits fragrance without 
anybody's rrequest and it is its merit. The flowers of grass are forbidden for worship, for they have 
no scent. And God is said to be sarva gandhaH sarva rasaH 'He is all the fragrance, He is all 
the essence...' The appealing sounds of the birds are taken as the recitation of Sama Veda, the top 
of the trees is parama pada , the heavens, and the flowers are the knowledge-full seers, and 
the birds are the innate souls captivated in living beings. The flower is an essential item in the worship 
of any religion and in Maha Naarayana Upanishad we are told it to be carrier of moral merit unto god, 
like its fragrance that can be felt at a distance without any visible medium. According to; Maha Narayanopanishad 
Section Eleven, Hymn 1: yathaa vR^ikShasya sampuShpitasya duuraat gandhovaatievam karmaNo duuraadgandho 
vaati -- maha Narayanopanishad ||

[Commentary] Just in the same manner as the fragrance of a tree in full blossom is wafted by the wind from 
a distant place, the fragrance of meritorious deeds-- the good name that accrues from them -- spreads 
to a great distance [as far as heaven.]

[Commentary] Thus the corollary of the teacher and the taught is also applicable here. The flowers are the teachers 
and their knowledge is fragrance, where the taught are the birds whose cooing is the chanting of Sama 
Veda. The birds, as the captivated souls, are seeking salvation in their chanting around the teachers 
i.e., flowers to communicate the same to god, with their fragrant knowledge. This enthrals the god, 
now Rama.

Shlok 19: "Air is vacillating these trees in this honey scented forest... and the trees appear to be enjoying 
their fluttering dance and seem to be swinging their treetops to appreciate the singing of honeybees 
that are humming in accompaniment to this dance... [4-1-18]

Shlok 20: "On mountain-planes that are beautiful with fully flowered and pleasant tress that entwine the mountain 
peaks with their high treetops, and thus these mountains indeed liven up with these great trees...[4-1-19]

Shlok 21: "Air is moving the treetops fully covered with flowers to swinging and the coronet like honeybees have 
to swing around those treetops, thus these trees themselves appear to be dancing to be dancing and singing... 
[4-1-20]

Shlok 22: "Fully flowered are these Karnikaara plants all over with golden colour flowers at top and yellow coloured 
stems, and they look like men wearing golden ornaments on their upper body, while their loin cloth is 
yellow... [4-1-21]

Shlok 23: "This spring with the soundings of many birds, oh! Soumitri, is enkindling grief in me, for Seetha is 
disunited...[4-1-22]

[Commentary] All the innate souls are required to be in unison with the Supreme Soul, and they are not to depart 
for the worldly illusions. Seetha's illusion to possess the Golden Deer chanced for her abduction, and 
thus disunited from Rama

Shlok 24: "I, who am already pervaded by grief, am now well sweltered by the Love God, and this cuckoo that has 
happy calls is rather calling me down... [4-1-23]

[Commentary] The hero hears the call of cuckoo as heroine's call. The God is listening to the same from the beings 
of nature, as a call for salvation. Rama, who has not heard any call of Seetha so far, which he will 
hear at the end of this canto, is in wait for such a call.

Shlok 25: "This gallinule bird happily calling in the forest brooks is making me awesome with its calls, as the 
Love-god has already made me awestricken... [4-1-24]

Shlok 26: "Earlier when we were in hermitage, on hearing this bird's call, dear Seetha used to call me to listen, 
and she herself was highly cheerful at this bird's calls... [4-1-25]

Shlok 27: "Very many amusing birds of that kind are flitting all over on trees, bushes, and creepers emitting 
very many sounds... see them, Lakshmana... [4-1-26]

Shlok 1: "Well mingled are these female birds with their male ones, for which they are well admired by their 
own flock, oh! Soumitri, and such birds are calling gladsomely together with the pleasing humming of 
king-bees... [4-1-27]

[Commentary] Prof. R. D. Ranade, the eminent professor of Indian Philosophies said that "Translations are always 
bound to be uncouth; they are like a heavy cart-load which moves slowly along..." So also Ramayana, 
whose text itself is a cartload, and the translations become many more cartloads. Much can be said in 
Kishkindha Kanda, for it comprises of many a derivative, which cannot be compressed and put together. 
The hero-heroine and the god incarnate aspects, together with some Indian philosophies included, are 
sufficient to become some more cartloads. The Hindu Love-god, Manmadha, unlike his European counterpart 
Cupid, has no body. At one time, Shiva burned Him down physically, for arousing lasciviousness in Shiva 
Himself. But Shiva makes the Love-god Manmadha to thrive without a physical body, at the request of 
Love God's wife Rati. Hence Love God is also called an anga = without, body. The bodiless nature 
and only the emotive responses in love are symbolical with the formless activity of romancing aroused 
by ananga or Manmadha, i.e., Love God. Alternately the word Manmadha not necessarily be taken 
as a noun, denoting the Love God alone. As a phrasal verb it denotes, mind, churning. mann; manas; 
madhaH - mannamsi mathate iti manmathaH... to churn. There is a platform called manas 
, below the subconscious level, and above sensory organs, which receives all the input from the sensory 
organs, which the manas separates, categorises, analyses and so on, and then sends to databank at subconscious 
level. Amara Kosha defines it as cittantu ceto hR^idayam svaantam hR^in maanasam manaH || dhii vargaand 
the separation is chittam, chetaH, hridayam, svaantam, hrit, maanasam, manH and this is not 
the composite mind, but a faculty of reason, what we generally call, a heart, a mind, a thought etc. 
Hence the lamentation of Rama is more churned out of his manas for Seetha, not just for amorousness, 
but for real love. And love, as per good old saying, is togetherness. Having lost that togetherness, 
Rama is pouring out his heart churned agony. Yet again, Rama the god indulges in those that are indulged 
in Him, and here his thoughts are constantly indulged in Seetha, his alter ego in heavens and on earth. 
In the Vaishnava mythologies, Vishnu incarnating on earth always looses his consort, Goddess Lakshmi 
and roams over to find Her. It is the same situation in narasimha incarnation. Goddess Lakshmi 
is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, after which Her consort Vishnu searches and 
retrieves Her, for no one on earth can amass heavenly wealth. In Lakshmi tantra, the Vaishnava aagama 
text Lakshmi states that: aham naaraayanii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa " I am indeed 
Naaraayanee [i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Vishnu..." [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.] Hence, Seetha may 
not be taken as yet another princess from this viewpoint.

[Commentary] Vasanta or spring is a friendly season, and Kishkindha is a friendly place, [and
Rama gets more friends in this place later,] but Rama's lifetime friend and supreme essence is
missing. For god, this burning is the sensation or perception of energy as warmth shown by the
devout nature, and its blessed souls. Shaiva/Shaakta traditions emphasises the power and majesty of
the God, whereas the Vaishnava theory demands a heart pouring devotion to achieve the God's saving
grace anugraha . Hence the lamentation of Rama as god is for the departure of his Shakti,
i.e., Goddess Lakshmi, visualising all the nature and its component devotees he created, such as,
trees, peacocks, birds, flowers, waters, mountains etc. All of this nature and its components are
maddening Him for love from that Shakti.

[Commentary] This point of view requires some understanding of Vaishnava canons and some
paancharaatra aagama expositions. The readers may find them in a great essay of Prof.
Samjukta Gupta on Pancharatra, in a 'worm's eye view', [for she calls it that way,] in a book
called Mantra . It is a collection of essays on the Hindu hymns by eminent Indologists
like Frits Staal, Ellison Banks Findly et al, published by the State University of New York Press,
State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 12246. These are published under their SUNY Series in
Religious Studies, and this one is under the editorship of Harvey P. Alper.

[Commentary] For the hero in the epic, it is the want of warmth from the heroine. It may
please be noted that if Rama addresses Lakshmana in the verse, it is a dialogue. Otherwise it is to
be treated as monologue or soliloquy or aside or the character's heartfelt feelings, aimed for
communicating to us, but not to Lakshmana alone. Not all the verses are spoken to Lakshmana. It is
a kind of commixture of dramatics and narration. Here the lovelorn Rama views Ashoka trees as the
arrow of the Love god, manmadha. The Love God has five arrows and they are:

[Commentary] 1.aravinda= a lotus [nelumblum speciosum], 2. ashoka= a flower of hellebore
origin, 3. chutam= mango flower, 4.nava mallika= new jasmine, 5.neela utpala= blue costus, are the
five arrows of Manmadha.

[Commentary] (1) Aravindam flower-arrow  hits chest  (2) Asoka flower-arrow lips  (3) mango
flower-arrow head  (4) new jasmine flower-arrow eyes; (5) blue costuses hits anywhere.

[Commentary] Their functions are: -

[Commentary] The five states associated with each arrow are: -1.unmaada= maniacal state,
tapana= fervent state, 3. shoshaNa= wasting away, 4. sthambhana= standstillness, 5. 
sammohana=
stupifaction.

[Commentary] The Ashoka flower kills natual hunger, Jasmine desciccates, mango flower fades
the colour, and lotusess causes criss-cross thinking, and the costuses incite the desire for
suicide.

[Commentary] The iridescent eye like spots on the back plumage of the peacock are said to be like a gavaaksha, go aksha  cow, eye. There used to be cow-eye like ventilators on the walls of ancient house to permit the 
air to circulate. Even a single feather of peacock is called the eye of the peacock for its glittering 
eye like spot. Here the air is permeating these eyes on the plumage of peacock and making those eyes 
look like crystals. Thus the spring breeze is permeating anywhere, including Rama, causing a want for 
the togetherness with Seetha. Unlike other birds, the peacocks do not mate often and in open. It has 
some ritual like dancing and secret in its conduct of mating.

Shlok 43: "Living in this flowering month is unbearable for me... Lakshmana, see the fondness even in those originated 
in animals, thus that peahen in her passion is following her husband... [4-1-41b, 42]

Shlok 44: "Had she, that broad eyed lady Seetha, not been abducted, she too would have followed me in this way 
with an ecstatic love... [4-1-43]

Shlok 45: "See Lakshmana, while these forests are abundantly weighty with flowers in wintry season these flowers 
are becoming futile to me... [4-1-44]

Shlok 46: "Though these flowers on the trees are exceedingly beautiful they are falling onto the earth wastefully, 
along with the swarms of honeybees hovering over them... [4-1-45.]

Shlok 47: "These blithesome birds appear to be inviting each other in mutual consent, and they are melodious calling 
as they like, and this is causing love madness in me... [4-1-46]

[Commentary] The calling of the birds in-groups suggests the harmonious prayers by the devotees, which is maddening 
the god to accord salvation to so many of them.

Shlok 48: "Should this spring season be there too, where my dear one Seetha is living, she with her unrequited 
merriment will definitely be saddened like me... [4-1-47]

Shlok 49: "Definitely this spring season will not touch that place where she is... and even if this touches that 
place, how can that lady with black-lotus-eyes can possibly comport without me! [4-1-48]

Shlok 50: "Otherwise, even if the spring happens to be there where my dear is, what can that fine waisted lady 
do under threat by others? [4-1-49]

Shlok 51: "She in midst of her youth, eyes like lotus petals, also soft-spoken one is my dear one... and definitely 
taken by the spring she leaves her life... [4-1-50]

Shlok 52: "Indeed in my heart a strong notion is prevailing that the chaste lady Seetha will be unable to live 
separated from me... [4-1-51]

Shlok 53: "My thoughts of Seetha alone are well biding in me, and in Seetha also thoughts about me will always 
be abiding... [4-1-52.]

Shlok 54: "This breeze carrying fragrance of flowers is though pleasant for touch and though coolish like snow, 
this alone is like fire to me as I am very much worried about that lady... [4-1-53]

Shlok 55: "By which breeze I always felt happiness earlier along with Seetha... that breeze alone is increasing 
anguish in me without Seetha... [4-1-54]

Shlok 56: "When Seetha was with me, then this crow flew into the sky and cawed much indicating Seetha's departure 
from me, and now sitting on a tree it is cawing agreeably indicating early arrival of Seetha... [4-1-55]

Shlok 57: "This bird alone, then roving in the sky indicated about the abduction of Seetha... and this very same 
bird will now lead me near to that broad eyed one... [4-1-56]

[Commentary] "The boons and curses in Ramayana" is an exclusive subject and there are a variety of books on these 
subjects. So also, the prognostications are another subject. Special attention will be paid to the cawing 
of the crow, for Rama blessed the crow. A crow is said to have requested Rama to remove its ugly look. 
Rama instead of blessing the crow to look like a white-swan blessed it to be proficient in foretelling. 
The crow's cawing is for both good and bad omens, which even now is an accepted belief. If the crow 
roves over in the sky continuously cawing, it is bad omen. If it sits on nearby tree or wall and caws 
incessantly, it is good omen to get desired things or to indicate the arrival of dear ones etc. Such 
prognostications are available by way of bad dreams etc., at many places in Ramayana.

Shlok 58: "Lakshmana, observe the appealing tonality of birds in the forest that calling out atop the flowered 
trees, that which is indeed furthering one's passionï¿½ [4-1-57]

Shlok 59: "That honeybee is quickly reaching these red flowers bouquets of Tilaka that are like his loved ones 
that are raising their faces with vigourï¿½[4-1-58]

[Commentary] The true devotee quickly grasps the nectar of knowledge from the teacher like the honeybee 
that quickly grasps the nectar of the flower, however vagrant the flower may be.

Shlok 60: "To the impassioned ones that Ashoka tree is very much enhancing grief, and with its bouquets of flowers 
hustled up by the wind it is sanding as though to daunt me... [4-1-59]

Shlok 61: " Lakshmana, these mango trees bearing greenish yellow flower are appearing like men whose hearts are 
flirtatiously aroused, and who have creamed their bodies with greenish-yellow body creamï¿½ [4-1-60]

Shlok 62: "Oh, tigerly man Soumitri, see these Pampa's amazing forests ranges... and therein the nymphs are moving, 
hither and yon... [4-1-61]

Shlok 63: "See Lakshmana, these fragrant and propitious blue lotuses are everywhere in the waters, glistening 
like tender sun... [4-1-62]

Shlok 64: "This Pampa Lake is shining forth with its tranquil waters, that contain lotuses, blue water-lily's, 
and red lotuses, along with swans and water-birds that permeate it ï¿½ [4-1-63]

Shlok 65: "Lotuses with the resplendence of tender sun enwrapping its waters, pollen grain pilfered by honeybees 
enwrapping those lotusesï¿½ with them this Pampa is beaming forthï¿½

Shlok 66: "This Pampa is always bedecked with the ruddy geese, amazing deep areas of the forest, and with water 
thirsty herds of elephants and deer, and with them it gleams forth... [4-1-65]

[Commentary] There is a discussion whether Pampa is a lake or a river. There are two rivers in Karnataka State of 
India, one Tunga and the other Bhadra, at whose confluence it is called Tunga Bhadra. The Vijayanagara 
Empire built their capital Hampi at this place. The regional language Kannada uses ' ha ' for Sanskrit 
' pa ' and hence Pampa is now called Hampi. Long before Vijayanagara dynasty, this place is ascribed 
to be Pampa, where the Kishkinda, the capital of monkey kings was situated. "The kingdom of Vanara or 
monkey race was in the north and west of Mysore, their chief city being Kishkindha near the village 
of Hampi on Tungabhadra..." Mysore and Conty Vol. I, page.178--Reie Vol. I pg. 146, and also in Bombay 
Gazetteer Vol. I pg. 142 of Dr. Bhandarkar. There are four copper plate inscriptions, dating around 
3012 BC, at Shimoga District, Karnataka State, ascribing that Janamejaya, son of Parikshat makes grants 
to the Pampa area, because his great grand father Yudhisthara of Maha Bharata rested on the banks of 
Tungabhadra at this place. However there is a vast lake like formation at present day Hospet and Hampi 
in Karnataka State, where three rivers, namely Tungabhadra, Varada and Hagari and their tributaries 
etc., meet and disperse. This place is geographically at Long. 76ï¿½--78ï¿½, and Lat. 12ï¿½--16ï¿½.

Shlok 67: "In the tranquil water the speed of wind is throbbing ripples, and the ripples throb the lotuses, thus 
the throbbing and rippling lotuses appear beautifulï¿½ [4-1-66]

Shlok 68: "That one with lotus-petal-like broad eyes, who always holds the lotuses dear...without finding that 
Vaidehi... to me my life is uninteresting... [4-1-67]

[Commentary] Rama's tranquil heart is throbbing like the ripples in the waters, because the resident in that lotus 
like heart, Seetha is missing. Goddess Lakshmi sits in the lotus holding lotuses, like the pollen, and 
the vast lake of tranquil waters is the heart of Vishnu.

Shlok 69: "Aha! Deplorable is the deviousness of Love-god, for he is causing reminisces about that graceful lady 
who articulates that gracefully, even if she is gone away and cannot be regained now... [4-1-68]

Shlok 70: "If this spring with its flowered trees is not going to deaden me... the Love-god is a possible one 
to tolerate, though now he came upon me forcefully...[4-1-69]

Shlok 71: "All those places or objects that were delightful ones to me when she was with me, and they alone are 
now becoming anguishing ones to me...for she parted from meï¿½ [4-1-70]

Shlok 72: "To gaze the petals of the lotus buds my sight is fascinated... and in them I perceive the pair of Seetha's 
bud-like eyes...Oh! Lakshmana...and they are alike thus... [4-1-71]

Shlok 73: "This breezeï¿½ let out from within the thickets of forests, breezing touching the pollen of lotuses, 
is reminding Seetha's exhale, as such it is heart-stealingï¿½ [4-1-72]

[Commentary] This verse is well explained by the ancient commentators in many derivatives. Some of them are:

[Commentary] 1] Rama wanted to take comfort in the breeze, at least. But that 
breeze itself is troubling him, because it is carrying the fragrance of the pollen of lotuses, which 
is like the fragrance of Seetha's breath. surabhi nishvashite dadatahtrishaam as in laxana shaastra 
. Exhale of the beloved bears a kind of fragrance, which is known only to her lover. Seetha also holds 
the lotus dear and every aspect of Seetha is lotus oriented and thus Rama's remembering of Seetha by 
seeing lotuses. [Ibid. satatam priya pankajaam - 4-1-67.]

[Commentary] 2] Goddess Lakshmi sits in the middle of the lotus, which will 
be in the heart of Vishnu. As of now She is stolen and Rama could not avert it. Hence the lotuses are 
angered at the loss of their resident Goddess Lakshmi, are taking the help of the breeze to carry the 
scent of the pollen, which is akin to Seetha's breath, and invade Rama's heart, to regain their tenant. 
Then a question arises as to why Rama confronts the invasion of this spring breeze without going away 
from there. In reply it is said that this breeze is like Seetha's breath, and it is coming from out 
of the thickets of the forests. So she must be around and appear to him any moment. Regaining Seetha 
is prime ordeal than the invasion of the cool spring breeze.3] Another way of putting this is: -- padma = Goddess Lakshmi; 
kesara - or - kesaraiH = affection, like fragrant pollen; samshR^iSTaH = carrying; 
vR^iksha antara vi nisshruta = tree of the Universe, within it, emitted; nishvaasa iva = uninterrupted breathe, like; 
siithaayaa = of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,] 
vaayuH = all-pervading 
ether [mythical]; manaH = [sins of] heart; haraH = stealing/obliterating one.
This is based on the ashwattha structure of the Universe.

1 uurdhva muulo'vaak shaakha eSho ashvatthaH sanaatanaH || 2-6-1 - kaThopanishad2 uurthvamuulam 
athaH shaakham ashvattha~N praahuravyaya~N ||15_1-3 - bhagavadgiita

 
The roots of Aswattha tree [the Holy fig tree, Ficus Religiosa, 
meaning that: shva = tomorrow; na stha = not there; the tree of the Universe that will not be 
there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves 
spread upside down as this Universe. This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess 
Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading 
ether, within the tree i.e., Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed 
with Her affection, but becomes a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for 
obliteration of his sins and to accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to 
the Almighty, than indulging in earthly cherishing. This is termed as nirhetuka satata dyaa prasaara 
i.e., without any precondition the grace of Goddess Lakshmi always flows.

The mountains always have similitude with kings as they stand high and noble on the land. The Himalaya 
is King Himavant, the father of Goddess Parvati, Shiva's consort. So also here the Rishyamuka Mountain, 
where Sugreeva takes asylum, is termed as a kingly mountain and Rama has not yet known the name of this 
mountain. On this mountain there are coloured dust splashes hiding the greenery of leaves, and the flowers 
are luminous in red colour, all over. This is indicating that the Kingly Mountain Rishyamuka is inviting 
the other King Rama or Rama the divine, with an incensed camphor, that will be red in glow and emits 
coloured smoke. This is the mangala aarati , the auspicious camphor-torch deference offered to kings 
of deities.

"Entering the blessed waters this bird, partridge, is rejoicing together with his female, kindling desire 
in me too... [4-1-93]

The question of self-control of Rama in indulgence is discussed here. Rama's libido is not expressed 
after the abduction of Seetha, until his entry into the area of Pampa or its forests. Here, in these 
surroundings of Pampa, the spring season is at its height and the nature is adding fire to his fuelling 
desire. What anyone can do but to lament about his unconsummated desire? That too, when Manmadha, the 
Love God, assumes the charge of this particular Chaitra month, or spring season, it is impossible to 
play-act celibacy. For more details about such a condition, Gosvami Tulasi Das is perhaps the best poet 
to narrate in Ram Charita Manas, at Doha 73 to 76 of Baala Kaanda. Narrated in there is, that the saints 
and sages lost their loincloths, chastity belts peeled off on their own, and entire social order went 
topsy-turvy, when Manmadha took charge of the Universe for only a few moments, to kindle Shiva's love 
towards Parvati. As such the nature at Pampa itself has become a love god to Rama, to pour out his passion 
for Seetha.

tasyaa manaaH ramaa guNaaH = its [of Pampa,] heart, pleasing, attributes; jagati vikhyaataa

"This sort of heart pleasing nature is also available with River Ganga, and that alone reasonably signifies 
the popularity of River Pampa in the world... [4-1-94]

Mahesvara Tirtha records the meaning of this verse in another way. "If this sort of love kindling atmosphere 
is there to River Ganga, it would have been the world's best environ..." But River Ganga is a Holy one 
and this environ cannot be there. This stanza signifies that Pampa is a river but not a vast lake, and 
all these narrations of longing epitomises the longing for a true friend like Sugreeva or Hanuma, or 
for Rama's life-mate Seetha.

reside, indeed; shakraaya = not, Indra's [throne]; na sprR^iha yeyam = I think of,

"If that devot lady Seetha is found, and also if we were to stay here only, I neither think about Indra's 
throne in Heavens nor Ayodhya's throne, which is like Indra's throne on the earth... [4-1-95]

The word shakraaya is in Dative case, meaning that the throne of Ayodhya is meant for an Indra-like 
ruler on earth, and qualifies for a demonstrative adjectival expression in its adjacency principle. 
As such Rama is pondering over negating the kingdom, i.e., the Rajya Lakshmi, in comparison with Seetha, 
who is his Bhaagya Lakshmi. Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsha, depicts what this Bhagya Lakshmi has to say, when 
Rama, basing on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject deserts Seetha.

upasthitaam puurvam apaasya lakShmiim vanam mayaa saarthamasi prapannaH |tadaaspadam praapya tayaati 
roShaat soDhaa asmi na tad bhavane vasantii ||raghuvamsha, XIV.63

" Earlier, you refused the kingdom-fortune, [Rajya Lakshmi,] and came to forests, where I was with you. 
Now that, that kingdom-fortune, Rajya Lakshmi winning your affection, is jealous of me i.e., Bhagya 
Lakshmi, and she does not let me live in your palace.

Seetha is an unusual princess by birth. Winning her hand in marriage is unusually preconditioned by 
King Janaka with the lifting of Shiva's bow, which none else could do than Rama. Having won Seetha's 
hand in marriage, but lost her in the forest, will be ridiculous. Rama reflects here as to how his father-in-law 
King Janaka would lookdown Rama for not protecting his daughter Seetha.

dur anvaya - wrong parsing of words in verse

The above is the wrong orientation of words used in above two verses. While the word-to-word translation 
of Ramayana is rare in print medium, the prose versions are giving meanings with such orientation, and 
they will be usually found in almost all printed books. The above suggests that Lakshmana is asking 
Rama to forget Seetha, which is meaningless. The following is said to be the reasonable orientation. 
Other words being same, the rest are:

priya jane= in dear, ones; sneham smR^itvaa= fondness, on remembering; iidR^ishaanaam= for this kind 
of; a + kaluSa atmaanaam= of un, blemished, souls; matiH mandaa na bhavati= intellect, languorous, will 
not, become; viyogajam duHkham tyaja= by separation, caused sadness, leave off.

"On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become 
languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation.

Such wrong orientations of words used in verses will be found in other verses also, because printed 
books are carrying them forward, and they need correction by some pundits who can kindly spare time 
and effort. The above correction is per courtesy of : Pt. Paturi Sitaramaanjaneyulu

Thus addressed by Lakshmana, then Rama whose conscience is marred by emotions, got rid of pity and fondness, 
and acquired courage, to perform the deed demanded of his incarnation. [4-1-124]

This reflects the saying of Bhagavad Gita gataasun agataasuumscha naanu shochanti panditaH... 
Lakshmana repeats the same words in Yuddha Kanda, the Book of War, chapter 83, verse 43, when Rama laments 
on receiving information that Indrajit, the son of Ravana killed Seetha. Here the word shoka 
' stands for pity and moha stands for fondness, and god has these two basic attributes towards 
His creation. Thus the pity and fondness of god is now aimed at releasing the innate soul, namely Seetha, 
from the captivation.

On seeing those two Rama and Lakshmana who are advancing his way, he that great soul who is a tree-branch 
animal, and he who strides like an elephant, derived profound agony that muffled him in worry, and he 
is engulfed under the weight of his fear. [4-1-129]

This episode is a construct on the hymn at 1-4-3 inBrihadaaranyaka 
Upanishadic which is as below: --

savai na rame | tasmaat ekaakii na ramate | sa dvitiiyam aicchat |sahaitaavaanaasayathaa strii pumaamsau 
sampariShvaktau |----tataHpatishca patniicaa bhavataam ---tatomanuShyo ajaayanta---BR^ihadaaraNyakopaniShad 1-4-3

God is said to take no delight in Himself alone, and He desired another.He was like an embraced male 
and female. Man and wife. Hence He felled His body to become twoâ¦ and from thereon humans originatedâ¦Brihadaaranyaka 
Upanishat 1-4-3.

The lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing 
to have His first creation with himself. This is for deifying Rama as incarnation of Vishnu. All the 
Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama's reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the 
same import. In Skanda Purana there is yet another instance stating that Rama gave curses to such lusty 
components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -

vaimukhyam gandha phalyaastu bhramaraan ashapat prabhuH |kokaan 
nishiidhevishlesham pikam anya vivardhanam |candanam sarpa nilayam vaayum sarpa ashanam tathaa|

"Champaka flowers [Hindi: Mogra; Telugu : Sampega; Botanical : 
Michelia champaka] are not to be touched by Honeybees, chakravaaka, [water-birds, ruddy geese, know 
for their inseparable swimming] be separated in midnight, Kokila birds [Blackcuckoos] be grownup in 
other's nests [i.e., in crow's nest] Sandalwood trees become shelters to snakes, the breeze [that is 
cool and incited Rama's thoughts about Seetha,]shall become food of snakesâ¦ thus cursed Rama, in his 
anguish about his separation from Seethaâ¦" Skanda Purana.

Â© 2000, Desiraju Hanumanta Rao [Revised - March 04]

[Commentary] 3] Another way of putting this is: -- padma = Goddess Lakshmi; 
kesara - or - kesaraiH = affection, like fragrant pollen; samshR^iSTaH = carrying; 
vR^iksha antara vi nisshruta = tree of the Universe, within it, emitted; nishvaasa iva = uninterrupted breathe, like; 
siithaayaa = of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,] 
vaayuH = all-pervading 
ether [mythical]; manaH = [sins of] heart; haraH = stealing/obliterating one.

[Commentary] This is based on the ashwattha structure of the Universe.

[Commentary] The roots of Aswattha tree [the Holy fig tree, Ficus Religiosa, 
meaning that: shva = tomorrow; na stha = not there; the tree of the Universe that will not be 
there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves 
spread upside down as this Universe. This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess 
Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading 
ether, within the tree i.e., Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed 
with Her affection, but becomes a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for 
obliteration of his sins and to accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to 
the Almighty, than indulging in earthly cherishing. This is termed as nirhetuka satata dyaa prasaara 
i.e., without any precondition the grace of Goddess Lakshmi always flows.

Shlok 74: "Soumitri, see those flowered Karnikara trees with their tree-trunks on those southern hill-terraces 
of Pampa, they are highly splendorous... [4-1-73]

Shlok 75: "That one, that kingly mountain which is ornamentally impregnated with ores and minerals is exhausting 
much mass of wondrous dust with the colour of its ores, that is drifted by the wind's speed... [4-1-74]

Shlok 76: "On the mountainsides, Soumitri, all over fully flowered are the exquisite Kimshuka trees, while their 
leaves are hidden under those reddish flowers, and with them that mountain is as though aglow... [4-1-75]

[Commentary] The mountains always have similitude with kings as they stand high and noble on the land. The Himalaya 
is King Himavant, the father of Goddess Parvati, Shiva's consort. So also here the Rishyamuka Mountain, 
where Sugreeva takes asylum, is termed as a kingly mountain and Rama has not yet known the name of this 
mountain. On this mountain there are coloured dust splashes hiding the greenery of leaves, and the flowers 
are luminous in red colour, all over. This is indicating that the Kingly Mountain Rishyamuka is inviting 
the other King Rama or Rama the divine, with an incensed camphor, that will be red in glow and emits 
coloured smoke. This is the mangala aarati , the auspicious camphor-torch deference offered to kings 
of deities.

Shlok 77: "On the banks of Pampa these jasmines, water-lilies, red oleanders have grown up and they are now flowered 
that is wetted with the fragrance of nectar...[4-1-76]

Shlok 78: "The Mogra bushes, Sinduka, Vaasanti are well flowered. Maadhavi, flowers are also fully fragrant, and 
everywhere there are bushes of Jasmine... [4-1-77]

Shlok 79: "Charming are the saplings of Bilva, and Madhooka, and plants like Vakula, Champaka, Tilaka, Naaga trees 
are well flowered.... [4-1-78]

Shlok 80: "Padmaka plants are well flourishing, and like that Neela, Ashoka are also flowered... trees on the 
mountain terraces namely Lodhra trees are brownish like lion's mane... [4-1-79]

Shlok 81: "The trees of Alangium, Kurntaka, Poornaka, Devadaaru, and also the Mango trees, and like that Patala 
trees, and the trees of Mountain ebony are flowered...[4-1-80]

Shlok 82: "Muchukunda trees, also Arjuna trees are seen on mountain terraces...Date palm trees, Uddaalaka trees 
also... like that the Shiriisha tree, simshupa trees, and dhava trees... [4-1-81]

Shlok 83: "Silk cotton trees, palaasha trees also, like that are red mehandi trees, thus are Tinisha and Naktamaala 
trees, sandalwood trees, spandana trees are all thus well flowered... [4-1-82]

Shlok 88: "And the honeybee on assessing each of the flower as 'this one is pure... this one is delicious... and 
this one is well bloomed...' is plunging into them... [4-1-87b, 88a]

Shlok 89: "On plunging into the flowers that nectar-avaricious honeybee is again coming up, and quickly going 
elsewhere in the trees on the banks of Pampa... [4-1-8]

Shlok 90: "These clusters of flowers that have fallen on their own are spreading out like a bed of flowers laid 
on, with them the ground appears to endow comfort... [4-1-89]

Shlok 91: "On mountain slopes varied flowers are spread out, with them the colour of diverse mountain slabs is 
rendered into yellow-red hue... [4-1-90]

Shlok 92: "Soumitri see the bloom of flowers in spring after winter, as if the trees have indeed bore the flowers 
in competition with one another... [4-1-91]

Shlok 93: "The drones of honeybees among the trees with flowered treetops appear to be the talk of trees, and 
the swinging branches of trees appear to be their invitational gestures to one another, thus those trees 
look highly attractive... [4-1-92]

Shlok 94: "Entering the blessed waters this bird, partridge, is rejoicing together with his female, kindling desire 
in me too... [4-1-93]

[Commentary] The question of self-control of Rama in indulgence is discussed here. Rama's libido is not expressed 
after the abduction of Seetha, until his entry into the area of Pampa or its forests. Here, in these 
surroundings of Pampa, the spring season is at its height and the nature is adding fire to his fuelling 
desire. What anyone can do but to lament about his unconsummated desire? That too, when Manmadha, the 
Love God, assumes the charge of this particular Chaitra month, or spring season, it is impossible to 
play-act celibacy. For more details about such a condition, Gosvami Tulasi Das is perhaps the best poet 
to narrate in Ram Charita Manas, at Doha 73 to 76 of Baala Kaanda. Narrated in there is, that the saints 
and sages lost their loincloths, chastity belts peeled off on their own, and entire social order went 
topsy-turvy, when Manmadha took charge of the Universe for only a few moments, to kindle Shiva's love 
towards Parvati. As such the nature at Pampa itself has become a love god to Rama, to pour out his passion 
for Seetha.

Shlok 95: "This sort of heart pleasing nature is also available with River Ganga, and that alone reasonably signifies 
the popularity of River Pampa in the world... [4-1-94]

[Commentary] Mahesvara Tirtha records the meaning of this verse in another way. "If this sort of love kindling atmosphere 
is there to River Ganga, it would have been the world's best environ..." But River Ganga is a Holy one 
and this environ cannot be there. This stanza signifies that Pampa is a river but not a vast lake, and 
all these narrations of longing epitomises the longing for a true friend like Sugreeva or Hanuma, or 
for Rama's life-mate Seetha.

Shlok 96: "If that devot lady Seetha is found, and also if we were to stay here only, I neither think about Indra's 
throne in Heavens nor Ayodhya's throne, which is like Indra's throne on the earth... [4-1-95]

[Commentary] The word shakraaya is in Dative case, meaning that the throne of Ayodhya is meant for an Indra-like 
ruler on earth, and qualifies for a demonstrative adjectival expression in its adjacency principle. 
As such Rama is pondering over negating the kingdom, i.e., the Rajya Lakshmi, in comparison with Seetha, 
who is his Bhaagya Lakshmi. Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsha, depicts what this Bhagya Lakshmi has to say, when 
Rama, basing on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject deserts Seetha.

[Commentary] " Earlier, you refused the kingdom-fortune, [Rajya Lakshmi,] and came to forests, where I was with you. 
Now that, that kingdom-fortune, Rajya Lakshmi winning your affection, is jealous of me i.e., Bhagya 
Lakshmi, and she does not let me live in your palace.

Shlok 97: "Nay... if I were to take delight this way in these pleasant green meadows along with her, there will 
be no worry to me... nor interest in other things... [4-1-96]

Shlok 98: "Indeed these beautifully leaved and variously flowered trees are maddening my heart as I am without 
that lady Seetha in this forest... [4-1-97]

Shlok 99: "See the cool water of this Pampa Lake, Soumitri, filled with blue lotuses, and with ruddy geese well 
moving in, and well venerated by the partridge birds...[4-1-98]

Shlok 100: "Well filled with waterfowls, curlew birds, and adored by great animals, this Pampa glistens much with 
pleasantly calling birds...[4-1-99]

Shlok 101: "Enkindling passion in me, are these umpteen gladdened birds, reminding me of my dear one who is in 
the mid of her youth, moonfaced, and with the radiance of lotuses in her eyes... [4-1-100]

Shlok 102: "See that female deer along with male deer moving there and there on those wonderful mountainsides... 
and at me, who am weaned away from such a fawn-eyed lady Seetha... and such as I am, my heart is further 
agonised on seeing these wide-eyed deer, and for not seeing her, the wide-eyed Seetha... [4-1-101]

Shlok 103: "If only I can see that lady on those spectacular terraces filled with impassioned bird groups with 
much ado, then there shall be peace for me... [4-1-102]

Shlok 104: "I live along for sure, Soumitri, if that slender-waisted Vaidehi basks in this benignant breeze of 
Pampa along with me... [4-1-103]

Shlok 105: ""Lakshmana, the breeze from the greenswards of Pampa that carries the fragrance of lotuses including 
that of red lotuses is an auspicious one, an eliminator of melancholy, and those that adore such a breeze 
are fortunate ones... [4-1-104]

[Commentary] Another rendering is: padma red lotuses', sougandhika of costuses, vaham 
= fragrance carrying, i.e. carrying the fragrance of many flowers as though in a garland of flowers 
on its chest; shivam pure, uncontaminated breeze, i.e., the first breeze of the season. 
dhanyaaH fortunate, sevante those that await and adore. Those couples that await this 
first breeze, emerging from the gardens of Pampa Lake, carrying fragrance of many a flower, like that 
of a garland of flowers, are fortunate.

Shlok 106: "That youthful, lotus-petal eyed beloved of mine, that Janaka's daughter... how can that helpless lady 
bear her lives without me... [4-1-105]

Shlok 107: "What sort of well-being can I say to that virtuous and truth speaking King Janaka, if he enquires about 
Seetha's well-being among hosts of people? [4-1-106]

[Commentary] Seetha is an unusual princess by birth. Winning her hand in marriage is unusually preconditioned by 
King Janaka with the lifting of Shiva's bow, which none else could do than Rama. Having won Seetha's 
hand in marriage, but lost her in the forest, will be ridiculous. Rama reflects here as to how his father-in-law 
King Janaka would lookdown Rama for not protecting his daughter Seetha.

Shlok 108: "She who accompanied me, an unfortunate one whom his father sent to forests, taking up a virtuous course... 
now where will be she, that ladylove of mine, be abiding... [4-1-107]

Shlok 109: "Whose kingdom is forfeited, and whose soul succumbed to the circumstance at the time of exile, but 
she accompanied suchlike me, and Lakshmana, without her how I can I live on in desolation... [4-1-108]

Shlok 110: "She who has a pretty and beaming face with lotus-like eyes, that is fragrant, auspicious and scarless, 
and not seeing such a face my mind is as though sinking... [4-1-109]

Shlok 111: " Lakshmana, when can I hear that conversation of Vaidehi that will have smiles and wits in between... 
wisdom wise pleasing, friendly and unique one in its own way... [4-1-110]

Shlok 112: "That youthful and decent lady though succumbed to suffering in forests used to look as though got rid 
of her sufferings, and as though gladsome woman, and she used to speak to me, one smitten by her love, 
very fondly... [4-1-111]

Shlok 113: "What can I say in Ayodhya to that kind hearted lady and my mother Kausalya, oh, prince Lakshmana, when 
she asks ï¿½where is she, my daughter-in-law? And how is she? ' [4-1-112]

Shlok 114: "Begone! Lakshmana.... you may see Bharata, that affectionate one for his brothers... I may not be able 
to live on leaving off Seetha... isn't so!" [So said Rama to Lakshmana] [4-1-113]

Shlok 115: To that great-souled Rama who is bewailing that way like a waif, his brother Lakshmana said these appropriate 
and infallible words. [4-1-114]

Shlok 116: "Oh, best one among men, please control yourself Rama, let safety betide you, do not lament, the intellect 
of your kind of unblemished souls does not become languorous... [4-1-115]

[Commentary] The above is the wrong orientation of words used in above two verses. While the word-to-word translation 
of Ramayana is rare in print medium, the prose versions are giving meanings with such orientation, and 
they will be usually found in almost all printed books. The above suggests that Lakshmana is asking 
Rama to forget Seetha, which is meaningless. The following is said to be the reasonable orientation. 
Other words being same, the rest are:

Shlok 117: "On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become 
languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation.

[Commentary] Such wrong orientations of words used in verses will be found in other verses also, because printed 
books are carrying them forward, and they need correction by some pundits who can kindly spare time 
and effort. The above correction is per courtesy of : Pt. Paturi Sitaramaanjaneyulu

Shlok 118: "If Ravana goes to the netherworlds, or still deeper worlds from there, oh my brother, still he will 
not live, Raghava... [4-1-117]

Shlok 119: "Let the emplacement of that sinning demon e obtained... and then he either cedes Seetha or enters into 
his own doom... [4-1-118]

Shlok 120: "Even if he enters the womb of Diti along with Seetha, and if he does not give away Seetha, even there 
I wish to slay him,...[4-1-119]

[Commentary] Please refer to Ch 45- 46 of Bala Kanda of details about Diti and someone entering her womb.

Shlok 121: "May you rejuvenate and be secure, oh, revered one, cast-off your pathetic mood... result of purpose 
will be lost indeed, for the endeavourers without a try, thus nothing can be regained by them... [4-1-120]

Shlok 122: "Vehemence is might, oh, noble one, there is no superior might than vehemence and to him with vehemence 
there is no impossibility in the world,... even the slightest... [4-1-121]

Shlok 123: "Vehement men do not regress in deeds, and taking hold of vehemence alone we regain Seetha...[4-1-122]

Shlok 124: "You leave off this enclosure of ardency and pushback that compassion ... you are not able to know your 
great and controlled soul...with these thoughts of self-pity and fondness... [4-1-123]

Shlok 125: Thus addressed by Lakshmana, then Rama whose conscience is marred by emotions, got rid of pity and fondness, 
and acquired courage, to perform the deed demanded of his incarnation. [4-1-124]

[Commentary] This reflects the saying of Bhagavad Gita gataasun agataasuumscha naanu shochanti panditaH... 
Lakshmana repeats the same words in Yuddha Kanda, the Book of War, chapter 83, verse 43, when Rama laments 
on receiving information that Indrajit, the son of Ravana killed Seetha. Here the word shoka 
' stands for pity and moha stands for fondness, and god has these two basic attributes towards 
His creation. Thus the pity and fondness of god is now aimed at releasing the innate soul, namely Seetha, 
from the captivation.

Shlok 126: He that inestimable valiant Rama strode forward those areas of charming Pampa Lake, with the charm of 
wind-flopped trees, getting rid of grief. [4-1-125]

Shlok 127: That great one Rama on observing all over quickly, all round the forest with its brooks and caves, and 
reviewing with Lakshmana, though agonised at heart that anguished one travelled on. [4-1-126]

Shlok 128: While that great soul Rama is walking ahead, that great souled Lakshmana whose stride is also like that 
of an elephant, and whose deeds are agreeable to Rama, vigilantly protected Rama with an un-despaired 
mind and even by his virtue and strength. [4-1-127]

Shlok 129: He who is the chief of Vanara-s, who moves about Mt. Rishyamuka, while he is meandering thereabout he 
happened to see those two who are so amazing for a look, namely Rama and Lakshmana, by which he is so 
frightened that he is petrified. [4-1-128]

Shlok 130: On seeing those two Rama and Lakshmana who are advancing his way, he that great soul who is a tree-branch 
animal, and he who strides like an elephant, derived profound agony that muffled him in worry, and he 
is engulfed under the weight of his fear. [4-1-129]

[Commentary] Here Dharmaakuutam depicts this:

[Commentary] This is for the entrance of Rama and Lakshmana into the life of 
Sugreeva.

[Commentary] This episode is a construct on the hymn at 1-4-3 inBrihadaaranyaka 
Upanishadic which is as below: --

[Commentary] God is said to take no delight in Himself alone, and He desired another.He was like an embraced male 
and female. Man and wife. Hence He felled His body to become twoâ¦ and from thereon humans originatedâ¦Brihadaaranyaka 
Upanishat 1-4-3.

[Commentary] The lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing 
to have His first creation with himself. This is for deifying Rama as incarnation of Vishnu. All the 
Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama's reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the 
same import. In Skanda Purana there is yet another instance stating that Rama gave curses to such lusty 
components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -

[Commentary] "Champaka flowers [Hindi: Mogra; Telugu : Sampega; Botanical : 
Michelia champaka] are not to be touched by Honeybees, chakravaaka, [water-birds, ruddy geese, know 
for their inseparable swimming] be separated in midnight, Kokila birds [Blackcuckoos] be grownup in 
other's nests [i.e., in crow's nest] Sandalwood trees become shelters to snakes, the breeze [that is 
cool and incited Rama's thoughts about Seetha,]shall become food of snakesâ¦ thus cursed Rama, in his 
anguish about his separation from Seethaâ¦" Skanda Purana.

SUNDARA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------

[Text] This first chapter of Sundara Kanda describes Hanuma's preparations to cross the
ocean in search of Seetha. Mighty Hanuma's flight over the ocean is described in a glorious detail.
Hanuma's encountering of Mainaka, Surasa and Simhika form important phases of His flight.

Shlok 1: After that, Hanuma, the destroyer of foes, desired to travel in the sky where
celestials like chaaranas tread, to search for Seetha, who was taken away by Ravana.

Shlok 2: Hanuma who desired to perform a deed done by no one else, shone like a bull without
any obstacles, with his stretched neck and raised head.

Shlok 3: After that, the mighty and courageous Hanuma roamed at ease on the lawns with the
hue of an emerald, which looked like still water from a distance.

Shlok 4: The thoughtful Hanuma tread like a rampant lion, making birds fear, uprooting trees
by his breast and also killing many animals.

Shlok 5-6-7: That great monkey Hanuma shone like an elephant in a lake, standing on the foot of
that great mountain by the name of Mahendra, where many elephants of good breed resided, which was
beautifully decorated with many naturally formed mineral rocks of varied hue like black, white,
red, blue, yellow and green and which was surrounded by godly serpents and Yakshas, Kinnaras,
Gandharvas who were capable of assuming desired form, together with their families.

Shlok 8: He saluted with joined palms to the Sun-God, Lord Indra, God of Wind, Lord Brahma
and Bhutas and decided to leave.

Shlok 9: Hanuma turned towards east, saluted his father, the Lord of Wind and increased his
body to go towards southern direction.

Shlok 10: With all the Vaanaras seeing, Hanuma decided to fly and like an ocean swelling on
full moon days, grew for Rama's success.

Shlok 11: With a desire to cross the ocean, Hanuma grew his body immeasurably and pressed the
mountain with his feet and hands.

Shlok 12: Thus tormented by Hanuma, that mountain shook for an instant and showered all
flowers of trees on it.

Shlok 13: Covered all through by those fragrant flowers which fell down from the trees, that
mountain shone like a mountain made of flowers.

Shlok 14: That mountain shed water like an elephant in rut emitting rut juice, after being
pressed by the mighty Hanuma.

Shlok 15: Pressed by that mighty Hanuma, streaks of gold silver and antimony color appeared on
the Mahendra mountain.

Shlok 16: Huge Rocks of Sulfur were also shot forth from that mountain, just as a fire burning
with a medium flame would emit columns of smoke.

Shlok 17: Being pressed on all sides by the mountain which itself was being pressed by Hanuma,
creatures living in the caves of that mountain shrieked in horrifying tones.

Shlok 18: That loud noise from creatures which emanated because of stress caused to the
mountain, filled the earth and all four directions and forests near that mountain.

Shlok 19: Great snakes with clear swastika signs on their hoods, spewed out frightening flames
with their great heads and bit the rocks with their teeth.

Shlok 20: Then those great rocks bit by those snakes with anger and venom, burned due to the
flame and split into thousand pieces.

Shlok 21: Medicinal herbs from that mountain, although capable of destroying ordinary poisons,
could not neutralize the poison from those snakes.

Shlok 22- 23- 24: Ascetics residing on that mountain flew away from there thinking that some demons
were destroying it. Vidhyadharas who lived there, became afraid and flew away with their women
folk, leaving behind them golden jugs of wine in the liquor house, gold vases, a varieties of
sauces that can be licked, eatables, various meats, skins of oxen and swords with golden hilts.

Shlok 25: The intoxicated Vidyadharas with garlands around their neck decked with red flower
garlands and smeared with sandal paste, with reddened eyes, and with lotus shaped eyes, obtained
the sky.

Shlok 26: Vidyadhara women wearing necklaces, anklets, armlets and bangles stood in the sky
with surprise and with smiles along with their loved ones.

Shlok 27: Vidyadharas and great sages stood in the sky in a group, showing their great prowess
and viewed the mountain.

Shlok 28: Then they heard words of Charanas, Siddhas and pure hearted Rishis who were located
in that clear sky.

Shlok 29: "This Hanuma, who is equal to a mountain, who is the son of Vayu, and who has great
speed, wants to cross the ocean which is abode to crocodiles."

Shlok 30: "Hanuma has decided to perform an impossible task for the sake of Rama and Vanaras
and wants to obtain the other side of ocean which is hard to obtain."

Shlok 31: Vidyadharas thus listened to the words of those great people and looked at the
incomparable Hanuma, best among Vanaras, standing on the mountain.

Shlok 32: He, who is equal to a mountain, shook his hair, quivered his body and let out a
great roar like from a vast cloud.

Shlok 33: About to fly, Hanuma jolted his tail, which was rolled into a circle from top to
bottom, and which was covered with hair, just as Garuda, the king of birds would jolt a snake.

Shlok 34: Receiving his vigor, the tail curled at his back was seen like a great serpent being
stolen by Garuda.

Shlok 35: Hanuma firmly supported his arms (on the mountain surface) which resembled huge iron
clubs, crouched the waist and contracted his feet.

Shlok 36: Bending shoulders and neck, that mighty and glorious Hanuma, increased his energy,
strength and courage.

Shlok 37: With his eyes raised up, seeing the way from a distance, viewing the sky, he held
his breath in his heart.

Shlok 38: That mighty Hanuma, equal to an elephant among monkeys and the best among Vaanaraas,
stood firmly with his legs, bent his ears and before flying spoke these words to the Vaanaraas.

Shlok 39-42: "I will go to the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana just like an arrow released by Rama
will go, with wind-like speed. If I do not see the daughter of Janaka there, I will go with the
same speed to the abode of gods. If I do not see Seetha there in heaven, I will get Ravana the king
of raakshasaas tied up in chains without any effort. I will, in all events, return successfully
along with Seetha or I will get Lanka along with Ravana after uprooting it."

Shlok 43-44: The best among Vaanaraas, Hanuma, spoke in this way to Vaanaraas and then without
thinking about anything else, flew up with lot of vigor. That great monkey also thought himself
equal to Garuda, the king of birds.

Shlok 45: While he was flying up, due to that force, all trees on that mountain flew away in
all directions, drawing together all their branches.

Shlok 46: While flying in the sky, he took along with him, because of the force of his thighs,
trees shining with flowers and with fattened lapwing birds.

Shlok 47: The trees thus being held aloft by the speed of Hanuma's thighs, followed him for a
while just as relatives would follow their loved ones embarking on a long journey.

Shlok 48: Uprooted by the force of Hanuma's thighs, Sal and other excellent trees followed
Hanuma like soldiers following their king.

Shlok 49: Hanuma the great monkey presented a wonderful sight, with his mountain-like
appearance together with the well flowered trees.

Shlok 50: After that, powerful trees sank into the salt ocean like mountains sinking into
ocean due to fear of Mahendra.

Shlok 51: That Hanuma who was equal to a cloud, covered with flowers of various kinds, shoots
and buds, shone like a mountain with fireflies.

Shlok 52: Those trees which were released by Hanuma's speed, dropped flowers and fell down in
the water like friends going back after bidding farewell to their dear one.

Shlok 53: Set in motion by the wind from the movement of Hanuma, that variety of blossom, with
various hues, from the trees fell down into the sea. That great ocean shone like the sky filled
with stars.

Shlok 54: Hanuma shone like a cloud in the sky decorated by lightening, with flowers of
various hues sticking to his body.

Shlok 55: That sea water looked like the sky with delightful stars rising up, with flowers
flown up by Hanuma's speed.

Shlok 56: That sky-borne Hanuma's arms which were spread out, were seen like five-headed
serpents coming out of a mountain's peak.

Shlok 57: That great monkey shone like one who is drinking the great sea together with its
waves. He also seemed like one who desires to drink the whole of sky.

Shlok 58: The eyes of that Hanuma, who was following the path of sky, which had a brilliance
equal to that of lightening, were shining like two fires on a mountain.

Shlok 59: The round, wide, reddish brown eyes of Hanuma, the best among the monkeys shone like
fully risen sun and moon.

Shlok 60: The ruddy face of Hanuma, with His reddish face shone like the Sun touched by
twilight.

Shlok 61: The tail of Hanuma, the son of Vayu floating in the sky, being risen up looked like
the pillar erected in honour of Indra.

Shlok 62: The great intellectual Hanuma, with his great body, and with white teeth, shone like
the Sun, being surrounded by his circular tail.

Shlok 63: That great monkey Hanuma, with his red colored buttocks, shone like a mountain with
a large deposit of red Gairika herb broken into pieces.

Shlok 64: Air passing through the lion among monkeys Hanuma's arm pits sounded like a
thundering cloud.

Shlok 65: The best among monkeys Hanuma flying thus in the sky, looked like a meteor darting
away with great speed in the sky from northern direction.

Shlok 66: With a fast pace equaling that of Sun god, the tall Hanuma shone like an elephant
which increases its size when being festered by a rope.

Shlok 67: Then Hanuma who was flying above the ocean with his body above the ocean and his
shadow being immersed in the sea below, looked like a boat being driven by wind.

Shlok 68: Whatever place Hanuma went towards on the ocean, that place became agitated due to
the force of thighs.

Shlok 69: That great monkey with great speed flew in the sky striking with his chest series of
waves which had a great body like that of mountains.

Shlok 70: Wind from the mighty Hanuma and the wind released from the clouds caused the ocean
with a fearful sound to shake a lot.

Shlok 71: Hanuma flew in the sky dragging along with him big waves from the ocean as though he
were sprinkling them in the sky.

Shlok 72: Hanuma with great speed crossed waves which were equal to Mount Meru and Mount
Mandara, that had risen up in the sea, as if counting them.

Shlok 73: Then the water together with clouds which was driven up by the force of Hanuma,
shone like a stretched autumnal cloud in the sky.

Shlok 74: Then various whales, fishes, turtles and crocodiles were being seen clearly in the
sea just as bodies of humans would be seen when clothes are removed.

Shlok 75: Serpents living in the sea saw Hanuma flying in the sky and thought that it was
Garuda, the king of birds.

Shlok 76: Hanuma's shadow which was ten yojanas wide and thirty yojanas long appeared very
beautiful on water.

[Commentary] Comment : "Yojana" is a measure of length in ancient India like the modern mile.
However its value does not seem to be a standard even within India. Some consider it as six miles,
some as eight miles and some as two and half miles. Hence it is difficult to have an accurate
conversion from yojanas to miles.

Shlok 77: That shadow which was following Hanuma and spread on the ocean, shone like a series
of dense white clouds.

Shlok 78: That great monkey Hanuma, the great resplendent one with a huge body, shone like a
mountain with wings flying in the sky without any support underneath.

Shlok 79: In whatever path Hanuma the mighty one went, in that path, there immediately
appeared a trough in the ocean below.

Shlok 80: Hanuma while coursing through the path of birds like the king of birds Garuda,
dragged with him series of clouds like the god of wind.

Shlok 81: Great clouds with white, red, blue and madder colors shone on being dragged by
Hanuma.

Shlok 82: Hanuma who is repeatedly entering and leaving series of clouds as He flies in the
sky, is being seen like the moon who shines and is hidden alternately.

Shlok 83: Then, on seeing Hanuma flying quickly in the sky, Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas
showered flowers on him.

Shlok 84: Then, the Sun did not scorch Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, who was flying for
Rama's welfare. The wind god Vayu also served him with a delightful breeze.

Shlok 85: Sages praised the great resplendent Hanuma flying in the sky. Devas and Gandharvas
also sang in His praise.

Shlok 86: Immediately on seeing the best among monkeys, Hanuma, flying without any effort,
Nagas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Devas and birds all praised Him.

Shlok 87: While that best among vanaras, Hanuma, was flying, the god of ocean thought thus for
the respect of Ikshvaaku dynasty:

Shlok 88: "If I do not help this best among vanaras Hanuma, I shall become prone to all kinds
of ill-talk by those who want to speak against me."

Shlok 89: "I was developed by Sagara of Ikshvaaku dynasty. This Hanuma who is helping a
descendant of that dynasty should not become tired."

Shlok 90: "I have to behave in such a way that Hanuma would take rest. After resting in me for
a while, He can cross the remaining distance with comfort."

Shlok 91: Samudra thus making a good thought, spoke to Mainaka, the best among mountains with
gold in the middle hidden in water.

Shlok 92: "O best among mountains Mainaka! You have been positioned here by Devendra as an
obstacle to the groups of asuras living in paataala."

Shlok 93: "You are standing at the entrance of paataala which is difficult to measure, fully
covering it, when asuras courageous by birth are trying to rise up again."

Shlok 94: "O mountain, you have capability to grow wide, up or down. O best among mountains,
for that reason I am encouraging you. Raise up."

Shlok 95: "Hanuma, the best among monkeys, the courageous one, who has taken up a fearful task
for the benefit of Rama, that such Hanuma while flying in the sky is coming over you."

Shlok 96: "To this Hanuma, who is a follower of the Ikshvaaku dynasty, help should be done by
me now. Descendants of Ikshvaaku are repectable to me. They are even more respectable to you."

Shlok 97: "Do help to us. Our task may not be miscarried. A task which needs to be performed
and not done, will increase the anger of good people."

Shlok 98: "Raise up above from the water. This Hanuma is the best among fliers and is a guest
to be worshipped for us. Let him stand on you."

Shlok 99: "O mountain with golden hued middle area and one who is served by Devas and
Gandharvas! Hanuma can take rest on you and then traverse rest of the distance."

Shlok 100: "You are fit to raise up after seeing the gentleness of Sri Rama, and the exile of
Seetha, and the effort of Hanuma."

Shlok 101: The mountain with gold in the middle, Mainaka, listening to the words of the salty
ocean, got up quickly from the water, together with great trees and creepers.

Shlok 102: Then that Mainaka became in the risen state, passing through the ocean water, just
like the Sun piercing through a cloud with His shining rays.

Shlok 103- 104: That great Mainaka who was covered by water in all directions, who had peaks with
Kinnaras and great serpents, which were equal to a sun rise, which were touching the sky, and which
had a golden hue, being ordered by the ocean, showed his peaks in an instant.

Shlok 105: The sky which had a bluish tinge like that of a sword, shone with a golden hue
because of the peaks of the mountain which rose up and which was like molten gold.

Shlok 106: That best among mountains became equal to a hundred suns with its peaks which had a
golden hue and which were shining with a self generated shine.

Shlok 107: Hanuma on seeing the mountain which stood before Him, rising up from the middle of
the salty ocean suddenly, decided that it as an obstacle.

Shlok 108: That great monkey Hanuma with a great speed, brought that great tall mountain with
His chest just as the God of wind would a cloud.

Shlok 109: That best among mountains Mainaka, thus being fell down by that Hanuma, recognized
Hanuma's speed and lauded him with pleasure.

Shlok 110- 111: Mount Mainaka with love and with gladdened heart obtained a human form and standing
on its own peak, spoke these words approaching that courageous Hanuma in the sky.

Shlok 112: "O the great Vanara! You have performed this impossible task of flying over the
ocean. Do come down on to my peaks and rest for a while to your comfort."

Shlok 113: "The ocean was developed by people born in Sri Rama's dynasty. That such ocean is
worshipping in lieu of Sri Rama, you who is desirous of Sri Rama's welfare."

Shlok 114: "When a service is done, a return service needs to be rendered. This is an ancient
tradition. Such this ocean who wants to do a return service to the Raghu dynasty, is suitable for
respect by you."

Shlok 115- 116: ""After flying a hundred yojanas, let this Hanuma rest on your peak and then travel
the rest of distance." - Thus I have been encouraged by this ocean for your sake due to His great
respect for you. O best among vanaras! Stop for a while and then go after resting on me."

Shlok 117: "O best among vanaras! For that reason, here is lots of roots, fruits and other
eatables which are fragrant and sweet. May you leave after eating that and resting here for a
while."

Shlok 118: "O chief among vanaras! Besides this, there also exists a relationship which is
famous in all the three worlds, which is based on great virtues, for us with you."

Shlok 119: "O son of Vayu, the god of wind! O best among vanaras! I am thinking you as being
very important among those vanaras who are fast and who are capable of flying."

Shlok 120: "By a person who wants to know dharma or by one who knows dharma, a guest even
though ordinary is to be respected. What else can I say in the case of a great guest like you."

Shlok 121: "O best among vanaras! You are the son of the great Vayu - the God of wind, who is
best in speed among the Devas. In speed you are equal to him alone."

Shlok 122: "O knower of Dharma! If you are worshipped, Vayu also gets worship. For that reason
you are to be worshipped by me. Also listen to another reason in this matter."

Shlok 123: "O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of
Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions."

Shlok 124: "After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures
together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall down."

Shlok 125: "Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the
wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon vajra then and there."

Shlok 126: "That Devendra angrily reached me with raised vajra. Then I was thrown away
immediately by the great Vayu."

Shlok 127: "O best among vanaras! With saved full wings, being thrown down into this salt
ocean, I have been protected by your father."

Shlok 128: "O chief among vanaras! Vayu is thus indeed respectable to me. For that reason I am
respecting you. My this relationship with you has great virtues."

Shlok 129: "O great Vanara! Because this matter is like this, you are suitable to make myself
and Sagara happy, with a gladdened heart."

Shlok 130: "O best among Vanaras! Reduce your fatigue. Accept our worship also. Respect our
love. I am happy by your manifestation."

Shlok 131: Hanuma listening to the best mountain's words, spoke thus : "I am happy. Hospitality
has been done. Let this ill feeling be removed."

Shlok 132: "The time to perform my duty is hastening me. The day too is passing. A promise has
also been given by me. I should not stand here in the middle neglecting my duty."

Shlok 133: The courageous Hanuma saying thus, touched the mountain with His hand, entered the
sky and flew on with a smile.

Shlok 134: That Hanuma was thus seen with great respect by the ocean and the mountain, and also
worshipped with suitable blessings.

Shlok 135: After that leaving the mountain and the great ocean, and flying up far into the
clear sky, Hanuma followed the path of his father.

Shlok 136: The son of Vayu obtained the speed to fly still higher into the sky and seeing that
mountain below, went in the clear sky which had no support.

Shlok 137: Seeing Hanuma perform that very difficult second task (first one being the flight
over ocean), all Devas, Siddhas and great sages praised Him.

Shlok 138: Devas and the thousand eyed Devendra who were there, became happy by the task of
that golden hued Mainaka.

Shlok 139: The wise Devendra himself spoke these words through faltering tones due to extreme
happiness, to Mainaka, the best among mountains.

Shlok 140: "O Mainaka, the king of mountains! I am very happy with you. O gentle one! I am
giving protection to you. Proceed according to your comfort."

Shlok 141: To the dauntless Hanuma crossing hundred yojanas, who is fearless even when there is
reason to be afraid, a great help has been done by you.

Shlok 142: This Vanara Hanuma is going for the benefit of Sri Rama, the son of Dasaratha. I am
very happy with you who is doing respect to Him.

Shlok 143: Thereafter, the best among mountains obtained great happiness on seeing Devendra,
the lord of Devas being happy.

Shlok 144: Then that mountain with a given boon from Devendra stood still there. Hanuma also
leaped over that part of the ocean in an instant.

Shlok 145: Thereafter, Devas together with Gandharvas, Siddhas and great sages spoke thus to
Surasa, the mother of Nagas, equal to the Sun in brilliance.

Shlok 146- 147: "This glorious son of Vayu, going by the name of Hanuma is flying over the ocean.
You obtain a horrible mountain like demonic appearance and make a face with fearful tusks,
red-brown eyes and as vast as the sky, and create an obstacle to Him for an instant."

Shlok 148: "We are desiring to find out if by His strength and also courage and intelligence He
can win over you or obtain sorrow."

Shlok 149-150: That Goddess Surasa, thus spoken to by Devas and also being respected by them,
wearing a horrible disfigured appearance of a demon in the middle of the ocean which caused fear to
all, and stopping Hanuma who was flying, spoke these words.

Shlok 151: "O best among Vanaras! You have been given by Devas as my food. I will eat you.
Enter inside my mouth."

Shlok 152: Thus spoken to by Surasa, the glorious Hanuma, with a happy face and with folded
hands, spoke these words to Surasa.

Shlok 153: "The son of Dasaratha, with the name of Rama entered the forest of Dandaka together
with His brother Lakshmana and wife Seetha."

Shlok 154: "When that Sri Rama, with a bitter enmity towards Rakshasas, was diverted in another
task, His famed wife Seetha had been taken away by Ravana."

Shlok 155: "I am going for Rama's sake as a messenger to find Her presence. O subject of Sri
Rama! You are suited to help Rama."

Shlok 156: "Otherwise after seeing Seetha and informing that to Sri Rama who makes Seetha
without troubles, I will obtain your mouth. I am promising truthfully to you."

Shlok 157: Thus being spoken to by Hanuma, Surasa with power to take desired form, spoke thus:
"No one can overcome me. This is my boon."

Shlok 158: Mother of Nagas, Surasa, desiring to know the strength of Hanuma, spoke these words
on seeing Him going away.

Shlok 159-160: "O best among Vanaras! You are bound to go only after entering my mouth. This boon
had been given to me long ago by Brahma." - speaking thus, with quickness she opened her wide mouth
and stood before Hanuma.

Shlok 160: Then Hanuma speaking thus to Surasa, became angry and became ten yojanas long and
ten yojanas wide.

Shlok 161: Seeing Hanuma, who looked like a cloud, being ten yojanas long, Surasa also made her
mouth twenty yojanas long.

Shlok 162: Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty yojanas long. Surasa made her mouth
forty yojanas high. The courageous Hanuma then became fifty yojanas high.

Shlok 163-164: Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty yojanas long. Surasa made her mouth
forty yojanas high. The courageous Hanuma then became fifty yojanas high.

Shlok 165: Surasa then made her mouth sixty yojanas long. The mighty Hanuma in the same
fashion, became seventy yojanas high.

Shlok 166: Surasa made her mouth eighty yojanas high. The mountain-like Hanuma then became
ninety yojanas high.

Shlok 167: The great wise Hanuma seeing that mouth with a long tongue which was horrible and
equal to hell being opened by Surasa, greatly reduced His own body and became the size of a
thumb.

Shlok 168: The glorious Hanuma with great speed, quickly entered Surasa's mouth and came out of
it and standing in the sky spoke these words to Surasa.

Shlok 169: "O daughter of Daksha! I indeed entered your mouth. My regards to you. I will now go
where Seetha is. Your boon also came true."

Shlok 170: Seeing that Vanara being released from her mouth like the moon from the mouth of
Rahu, goddess Surasa spoke these words assuming her normal form.

Shlok 171: "O gentle Hanuma! Go according to your comfort to achieve the desired task. Bring
Seetha together with the great Sri Rama."

Shlok 172: Seeing that third very difficult task of Hanuma, all the creatures then praised
Hanuma saying "Good! Good!".

Shlok 173: That Hanuma, equal to Garuda in speed, neared the ocean which is the abode of
Varuna, entered the sky and went in His original path.

Shlok 174-180: Hanuma went, like Garuda, in the sky served by clouds (or streams of water), served
also by birds, tread by masters of music Tumbura and other Gandharvas, served by Airavata, borne by
lions, elephants, tigers, birds and serpents, decorated by clear Vimanas moving with great speed,
shone by fires with thunderous jolt equal to that of Vajra - the weapon of Devendra, decorated by
people with good deeds, people with great luck who conquered the heavens, served by the God of fire
carrying great quantities of oblations, shone by planets, stars, moon, sun and starlets, occupied
by groups of great sages, Gandharvas, Nagas, Yakshas but unpopulated by humans, clear and all
pervasive, served by the gandharva king Vishvaavasu, roamed by elephants of Devendra, the path of
the moon and the sun, the auspicious one, a wide canopy of the earth constructed by Brahma, served
in various ways by excellent courageous groups of Vidyadharas.

Shlok 181: Hanuma, the son of Vayu, visible everywhere, obtained the sky without support, like
the king of birds with long wings.

Shlok 182: A demoness by the name of Simhika with the power to assume desired form, saw Hanuma
flying, increased in size and thought thus in her mind.

Shlok 183: "After a long time, this great animal came into my grasp. After long time, today I
will enjoy my meal."

Shlok 184: Thinking thus in her mind, Simhika attracted His shadow. While the shadow was thus
being grasped, Hanuma thought thus.

Shlok 185: "Like a great boat in the ocean with opposing winds, I am being pulled back
forcefully, with disabled power."

Shlok 186: After that, Hanuma looking sideways, upwards and downwards, saw a big animal raised
up in the salty ocean.

Shlok 187: Hanuma saw that animal with a horrible face and thought: "This animal with a strange
appearance, with great strength attracting shadow, is indeed the animal that had been told by
Sugriva. There is no doubt in that."

Shlok 188: That wise Hanuma recognizing that animal correctly as Simhika, increased His body
greatly, like a cloud in rainy season.

Shlok 189: That Simhika seeing the growing body of the great monkey Hanuma, spread her mouth to
be equal to the middle of Patala.

Shlok 190- 191: Roaring like a dense cloud, she ran towards the Vanara. Then the wise Hanuma saw her
opened very big mouth equal to His own body and also her internal organs.

Shlok 192: That Hanuma with great strength and with a body equal to a diamond, repeatedly
contracted His body and fell into her opened mouth.

Shlok 193: Siddhas and Charanas saw Hanuma sinking in her mouth, like the full moon on a full
moon day being swallowed by Rahu.

Shlok 194: Then Hanuma rend her internal organs with His sharp nails and after that flew up
with a speed equal to that of thought.

Shlok 195: That wise Hanuma felling Simhika down with His vision, courage and ability,
developed again by speed.

Shlok 196: That Simhika with heart rend by Hanuma fell in water with sorrow. Seeing Simhika
killed by Hanuma, creatures roaming in the sky spoke thus to that best among Vanaras.

Shlok 197: "O best among Vanaras! A huge animal has been killed by you. A great task has been
done. Perform the task dear to you auspiciously."

Shlok 198: "O best among Vanaras! Whoever has the four qualities of courage, vision, intellect
and skill, all these four virtues like you, such a person will not fail in any task."

Shlok 199: That Hanuma the respectable one, thus respected by them, entered the sky and went
like the Garuda with a determined goal.

Shlok 200: Hanuma after almost reaching the other shore, looked in all directions and saw a
series of trees at the end of his journey of hundred yojanas.

Shlok 201: The best among Vanaras, Hanuma, immediately after getting down also saw an island
decorated by a variety of trees and also the forests in the region of Malaya.

Shlok 202- 203: That Hanuma with controlled senses and with good thoughts looked at the ocean, the
bay and the trees born in the bay, and also the faces of the wives of the ocean (rivers are
considered wives of ocean), observed Himself to be equal in size to a great cloud as though
stopping the sky, and thought thus.

[Commentary] Comment : It is considered an auspicious sign to be welcomed by married women.
Hanuma seeing the wives of Sagara coming to meet their husband thus bodes well for Hanuma.

Shlok 204: "After seeing my huge body and the speed, Rakshasas will become curious." - thus
thought the great Hanuma.

Shlok 205: For that reason, Hanuma reduced His mountain-like body and obtained the nature of
one who reached self-realization, free from infatuations.

Shlok 206: Hanuma greatly reducing His size became normal in nature regaining His original
form, like Vishnu who mitigated the strength of Bali by taking three strides.

Shlok 207: Hanuma capable of assuming many different beautiful forms, who cannot be defeated by
enemies, obtained the other side of ocean and being cognizant of Himself restored His own form and
became with a decided mission.

Shlok 208: After that great one who looked like a huge mass of clouds, alighted on the mountain
peak of Lamba with wonderful lower peaks, abundant with various things and filled with Ketaka,
Uddalaka and coconut trees.

Shlok 209: After that Hanuma for His part obtained the ocean shore, observed the city of Lanka
from the top of the mountain, leaving His original form, tormenting animals and birds, alighted on
that mountain.

Shlok 210: Having tranersed, by the dint of his strength over the ocean which was infested with
demons and reptiles and endowed with series of huge waves, and alighting on the shore of the great
sea, Hanuma then saw the City of Lanka having a resemblance of Amaravati, the capital City of
Indra.

[Text] This chapter introduces us to the glorious city of Lanka and Hanuma's first encounter with it. The geography around 
the island where Lanka is located is described herein. The chapter also depicts the initial reaction of Hanuma 
on seeing the city and his initial thoughts about the feasibility of the task of overcoming the Rakshasas and 
Ravana to reunite Sri Rama with mother Seetha. As the book progresses, we shall see how Hanuma overcomes these 
thoughts and moves toward achieving this task.

Shlok 1: That Hanuma with great strength crossed the insurmountable ocean without becoming tired and viewed the city of 
Lanka located on the peak of Mount Trikuta.

Shlok 2: After that, the powerful Hanuma standing there shone like one made of flowers being showered by a rain of flowers 
released by trees.

[Commentary] Comment : Being showered by flowers is considered auspicious.

Shlok 3: The glorious Hanuma with the best courage, even though crossing a hundred yojanas, was without a sigh and did 
not obtain any tiredness.

[Commentary] Comment : This verse and others clearly mention that Hanuma crossed an ocean of hundred yojanas. At the present 
time the shore to shore distance between southern tip of India and Northern tip of Sri Lanka is around sixty miles. 
Even with a measure of 2.5 miles per yojana, hundred yojanas translate to 250 miles. To explain this anomaly, 
we need to consider that around the time of Ramayana, the distance was lot more than the current sixty miles. 
This is in sync with the current theories by geologists that the ocean between India and the current Sri Lanka 
had been replaced by land mass over a period of time. Most of the land to the south of current Raghunatha Pura 
had been covered by landmass in antiquity. Also according to Ramayana, the mountains Trikuta, Lamba and Suvela 
were to the north of Lanka, but currently the mountains are found in the southern part of Lanka. This suggests 
that the northern parts of current Lanka were submerged in water during the Ramayana period.

Shlok 4: "I can cross many hundreds of yojanas. What to say about the end of the ocean which had been counted to be hundred 
yojanas long?"

Shlok 5: That Hanuma, the best among powerful ones and the foremost also among those who can fly, reached the city of Lanka 
by crossing the great ocean with good speed.

Shlok 6: He passed through forests with dark green hued fragrant lawns and also consisting of great rocks and hills.

Shlok 7: Hanuma, the best among Vanaras and the radiant one, tread on mountains covered with trees and on series of trees 
full of flowers.

Shlok 8: That son of God Vayu stood on a mountain and saw forests and gardens and also the city of Lanka situated on the 
top of a mountain.

Shlok 9-10-11-12-13: Standing on that mountain, the elephant among monkeys, Hanuma, saw pine trees, Karnikaras, date-palms in full 
blossom, Priyalas, lemon trees, wild jasmine trees, mogra trees, long pepper trees filled with sweet fragrance, 
Kadamba trees and seven leaved banana trees, Asana trees, Kovidaras, Karaviras in full blossom, trees that were 
tied by the weight of their flowers and flower buds, that were distressed by birds, with their crests moved by 
wind, wells and various glorious pleasure-groves filled by various trees that give fruits and flowers in all seasons 
and beautiful gardens also, surrounded by various ponds consisting of swans and ducks.

Shlok 14- 15- 16- 17- 18: The glorious Hanuma neared the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, and saw the city which looked like the city of Gods 
in heaven, decorated by moats filled with lotuses and water-lilies, which was well protected, since the time of 
Seetha's abduction, by Ravana and by Rakshasas with horrifying voices roaming around, which was surrounded by 
a golden boundary wall, that beautiful great city consisted of houses equal in height to mountains and which looked 
like autumnal clouds, with white and elevated main streets, decorated with flags and pennons, with excellent golden 
hued archways adorned with sculpted rows of vines.

Shlok 19: That best among monkeys Hanuma saw the city of Lanka with beautiful white buildings situated on the top of a mountain 
like a city located in the sky.

Shlok 20: Hanuma saw that city of Lanka ruled by Ravana the king of Rakshasas, constructed by Visvakarma (architect of Gods), 
and which looked as though it were floating in the sky.

Shlok 21- 22: Hanuma saw the city of Lanka with buttress and enclosure wall as her hip and loins, the vast body pf water in 
the moat as her raiment, Satagnis and Sulas as her locks, the mansions as her earrings, constructed by thought. 
He reached the northern gate and thought thus.

Shlok 23- 24- 25- 26: Hanuma saw the city of Lanka equal to peak of Kailasa as though touching the sky, as though flying to reach the 
sky, with its best mansions, filled with horrible rakshasas and serpants like the city of Bhogavati (capital of 
Patala), one which was unfathomable, a well arranged and a clear city governed by Kubera in earlier times, protected 
by courageous, horrible serpents and Rakshasas with mouths with sharp teeth like a cave, with spikes and Pattisas 
(spears) in their hands. Hanuma saw that Lanka's great protection and the ocean and Ravana the horrible enemy 
and thought thus.

Shlok 27: "Even if Vanaras were to come here they would not meet with success. It is not possible even for Devas to be victorious 
against Lanka in war".

Shlok 28: "Even if He reaches this very difficult and impenetrable Lanka ruled by Ravana, what can that Sri Rama with mighty 
arms do"?

Shlok 29: "In the matter of overcoming rakshasas, there seems to be no opportunity for persuasion, gifts, dissension or 
even war".

Shlok 30: "Only four great Vanaras can come here - the son of Vali (Angada), Nila, myself and the wise king Sugriva".

Shlok 31: "I will first find out if Seetha is alive or not. I will think all this later, after seeing that daughter of Janaka".

Shlok 32: After that, that elephant among monkeys Hanuma who was interested in the welfare of Sri Rama, stood on that mountain 
peak and thought for an instant.

Shlok 33: "It is not possible for me to enter the city of ogres protected by cruel and strong rakshasas, with this appearance".

Shlok 34: "All these mighty ogres with extraordinary energy and great prowess are to be cheated by me while engaged in the 
search of Seetha".

Shlok 35: "To achieve this great deed successfully, entering the city of Lanka in a small form at night is a timely thing 
to do" .

Shlok 36: Hanuma saw such that city of Lanka, which was difficult to overcome even for Devas or asuras, and thought thus 
repeatedly.

Shlok 37: "By what idea can I see Seetha the daughter of Janaka, unseen by the wicked Ravana, the king of the ogres.

Shlok 38: "How can the task of Sri Rama, one who knows self, not be destroyed? How can I alone see Seetha alone in a place 
devoid of people?."

Shlok 39: "With a mediator who has an unsteady and gloomy mind working against time and place, tasks that are otherwise 
ready to succeed get harmed, like the darkness that gets destroyed at dawn".

Shlok 40: "Even a decided mind will not shine when thinking about gain and loss. Mediators who are respected by scholarly 
people will also harm tasks due to their arrogance."

Shlok 41: "How will the task at hand be not harmed? How will my mind not get gloominess? How will not the crossing of ocean 
go waste?."

Shlok 42: "If I were to be seen by rakshasas, this task of Sri Rama, with a famed mind, who desires the slaying of Ravana 
will become wasteful."

Shlok 43: "It is not possible to be in Lanka even in the form of a rakshasa. What to say about being there in any other 
form?"

Shlok 44: "My thought goes thus: Even wind cannot pass here without being known. There is nothing not known to the might 
rakshasas."

Shlok 45: "If I stay here with my usual form, I can be destroyed. The task of the Lord will also be harmed."

Shlok 46: "For that reason, I will become small in my appearance and will enter Lanka at night for the success of the task 
of Sri Rama."

Shlok 47: "Entering the unapproachable city of Lanka at night and searching all the mansion of Ravana, I can see Seetha."

Shlok 48: The courageous Hanuma thus thinking and being interested in discovering Seetha, then desired the sun to set.

Shlok 49: After the sun had set, Hanuma reduced His body at night with a size equal to that of a cat and became a wonderful 
sight to behold.

Shlok 50: The courageous Hanuma quickly flew during evening time and entered the beautiful city with well divided main pathways.

Shlok 51- 52: Hanuma saw that great city filled with series of mansions, golden hued pillars and window lattices, which was 
equal to the city of Gandharvas, consisting of seven and eight storied buildings with their top portions studded 
with crystals and pearls and decorated with gold.

Shlok 53: There in that city of Lanka, the houses of rakshasas shone with top portions painted by cats-eyes and emeralds 
and decorated by groups of pearls.

Shlok 54: Golden archways with strange hues illuminated the well decorated city of Lanka in all directions.

Shlok 55: Hanuma on seeing the unimaginable city of Lanka with a wonderful appearance became sad thinking about the prospect 
of capturing Lanka and also happy being eager to see Seetha.

Shlok 56: Hanuma saw that city of Lanka of great fame, with white, closely built buildings having golden windows and doorways 
of great value, consisting of ogres of great strength and ruled by the hands of Ravana.

Shlok 57: The shining moon too rose up with its many thousands of rays, as though performing help to Hanuma, being at the 
middle of its retinue of stars and covering the earth with a canopy of light. That Hanuma saw the moon rising 
up with a glow of a conch shell, shining with a milky white hue of a lotus-fiber, like a swan swimming in a lake.

Shlok 58: That Hanuma saw the moon, who was rising up in the sky with the splendour of a couch-shell, shining in white colour 
as milk or lotus-fibre, and looking like a swan swimming in a lake.

[Text] In this chapter Hanuma faces Lanka, the city of Lanka herself in the form of a demoness.

Shlok 1-2: That Hanuma, best among monkeys, the intellectual son of Vayu, one with great might, stood on the 
moutain called Lamba with its high peaks equalling a high cloud, gathered courage and entered at night the city 
of Lanka ruled by Ravana and filled with beautiful forests and places of water such as lakes.

Shlok 3-4: The city of Lanka was shone by buildings equalling autumnal clouds. With a sound resembling that 
of an ocean, it was served by ocean breeze. It was filled with well fed and mighty armies like Vitapati, the capital 
of Kubera. It had elephants positioned at archways and had white gates and archways.

Shlok 5-6-7: Quickly approaching that city of Lanka which was protected by Rakshasas, like the the auspicious 
city of Bhogavati being protected by serpents moving about, spread with cloud illumined by flashes of lightening, 
served by pathways of stars, witha light breeze like the Indra's city of Amaravati, surrounded by a wall with 
a golden hue, decorated by flags with sounds from groups of small bells. He became happy and leapt up the wall.

Shlok 8-9-10-11-12: Seeing the city everywhere Hanuma became surprised at heart. Thereafter Hanuma the monkey, became 
happy seeing the doors which were of golden color, with platforms of cat's eye gems, inlaid with diamonds, crystals 
and pearls, embellished with floors of gems, graced with elephants made of refined gold, crowned with spotless 
white silver, stairs studded with cat's eye gems, with inside walls made of crystal free from dust, provided with 
lovely assembly halls, with sounds of Krauncha birds and peacocks, served by royal swans, looking as though flying 
toward the sky, with auspicious houses resounding everywhere with the sounds of clarionets and ornaments, equalling 
the city of Vasvaukasaara, as though flying towards the sky.

Shlok 13: Seeing that city of Ravana, which was best among cities, a wealthy city, a beautiful and auspicious 
city, that powerful Hanuma thought thus.

Shlok 14: "It is not possible for anyone else to oppose this city, by strength alone, which is being guarded 
by armies of Ravana with raised weapons."

Shlok 15: This land may be conquerable by Kumuda or Angada, to the great monkey Sushena or to Mainda or Dvivida.

Shlok 16: There may be access to this land to the son of Sun God Sugreeva, to the monkey Kusaparvana, to 
the chief among monkeys Riksha and to me.

Shlok 17: Considering the long armed Sri Rama's strength and Lakshmana's valour, Hanuma became happy.

Shlok 18-19: That great monkey saw that city of king of rakshasas like a wealthy woman decorated with diamonds 
for her clothes, with various storage houses as earrings, with amouries for her breasts. Due to the lamps that 
illuminated the radiant great houses, all darkness was lost.

Shlok 20: Thereafter, the guardian of that city, in her own form, saw Hanuma, the best among monkeys and 
the mighty one, entering.

Shlok 21: Seeing that best among monkeys Hanuma there, that Lanka ruled by Ravana, rose up herself with a 
horrific appearance of face an eyes.

Shlok 22: She stood in front of the best among Vanaras Hanuma. She made a great sound and spoke to Hanuma 
thus.

Shlok 23: "O one who lives in gardens! Who are you? For what reason did you come here? As long as your lives 
are sustained, tell me the truth here before that."

Shlok 24: "O Vanara! It is indeed not possible for you to enter this city of Lanka which is protected by 
Ravana's forces and strongly guarded all around."

Shlok 25: Therafter the mighty Hanuma spoke to Lanka standing in front of Him as follows : "Whatever matter 
you are asking me, I will tell you that truthfully."

Shlok 26: "You are standing at the entrance to the city. O one with ugly eyes! Who are you? O horrible one! 
Stopping me, for what reason are you threatening me?"

Shlok 27: Listening to Hanuma's words, that Lanka, with ability to achieve desired form, became angry and 
spoke these strong words to Hanuma.

Shlok 28: "I protect this city, being invincible. I wait for the orders of the king of demons Ravana, the 
great one."

Shlok 29: "After humilliating me it is not possible for you to enter the city. Being beaten by me, you will 
leave life and have a permanent sleep."

Shlok 30: "O Vanara! I am protecting this city of Lanka in all directions. This matter has been already told 
to you by me."

Shlok 31: The son of Vayu and best among Vanaras heard Lanka's words and stood up like a second mountain, 
with a purpose.

Shlok 32: Thereafter that Hanuma the wise one, with great strength, best among those who can fly and best 
among Vanaras, saw that city of Lanka in the form of an ugly woman and spoke thus.

Shlok 33: "I should like to see the city of Lanka with its palaces, defensive walls and archways. I came 
here for that reason. I am very curious to see them."

Shlok 34: "My arrival here is indeed to see Lanka's gardens, parks, forests and important houses all over."

Shlok 35: Listening to Hanuma's words, Lanka with the ability to assume desired form, spoke harsh words stronger 
than before.

Shlok 36: "O lowly Vanara with an evil mind! It is not possile for you to see this city ruled by king of 
rakshasas, without first defeating me."

Shlok 37: Then that tiger among Vanaras Hanuma spoke to that demon : "O auspicious one! After seeing this 
city I will return back again to where I came from."

Shlok 38: Thereafter that Lanka made a great sound causing terror and hit Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, 
with her palm quickly.

Shlok 39: Then that tiger among Vanaras, the powerful son of Vayu, being hit powerfully by Lanka made a great 
sound.



Thereafter that Hanuma became dizzy with anger and folded his fingers of left hand. He then hit 
her with His fist. "She is a woman" - thinking thus He did not show much anger by Himself.



That demon fell on land immediately by that hit with a distressed body and appeared with a horrific 
face.



Thereafter the intellectual and glorious Hanuma saw her fallen down and thinking her to be woman, 
showed kindness.



Thereafter that Lanka being very gloomy spoke with a falterting tone without pride these words 
to Hanuma the Vanara.



"O long armed one! O best among Vanaras! Get propitiated and protect me. O gentle one! Those with 
great strength and courage always stand firm on tradition."



"O Vanara! I am myself the city of Lanka. O strong one! O courageous one! I am defeated by your 
strength."



"O lord of Vanaras! In earlier times I had been given a boon by Lord Brahma. Hear from me about 
this matter."



"Let this be known by you - whenever a Vanara conquers you with his might, then a fear will come 
for Rakshasas."



"O gentle one! With your appearance now, that time has come for me. Ordinance of Brahma is the 
truth and is immutable."



"The destruction has come for Ravana the evil minded king and to all Rakshasas due to Seetha."



"O best aming Vanaras! For that reason, enter the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and do here whatever 
tasks you want to."



"O lord of Vanaras! Enter the auspicious city of Lanka stuck by the curse, ruled by the king of 
Rakshasas, roam everywhere and search for the chaste wife Seetha according to your comfort."

Yojana tall.

Rakshasas and the house of Ravana, containing elephants with four tusks and also those with three
tusks, those with two tusks and still not crowded. It was protected by soldiers bearing raised
weapons.

Shlok 6-7: That building surrounded by the wives of Ravana, by demonesses, and princesses
brought by strength, was like an ocean filled with crocodiles, big fishes, sharks and other fishes,
moved by the speed of wind, and together with serpants.

Shlok 8: Whatever wealth is at Kubera, whatever riches at Indra with green horses, all that
affluence was at Ravana's house. That wealth was always without reduction.

Shlok 9: Whatever was the fortune of Kubera the King of Yakshas, of Yama and of Varuna, the
same fortune or even greater treasure was at this house of Ravana.

Shlok 10: Hanuma saw another house in the middle of that house, a well built one consisting of
many elephants in rut.

Shlok 11: Whatever wonderful aeroplane by the name of Pushpaka, decorated with all kinds of
precious stones, made by Visvakarma in heaven for lord Brahma, whatever plane Kubera obtained by
great austerity from Lord Brahma, Ravana obtained that plane by prowess defeating Kubera.

Shlok 13-14: Supported by pillars decorated with images of wolves, with silver and golden hue and
which were well made, radiant with splendour, decorated all around with rooms equalling Mount Meru
and Mount Mandara, as though touching the sky with an auspicious shape.

Shlok 15: Well made by Visvakarma and resembling Fire and Sun in splendour, with stairways
made of gold and with beautiful and best platforms;

Shlok 16: With windows and ventilation holes made of gold and also made of crystal, with
platforms made of sapphires and emeralds;

Shlok 17: Shone by floors embellished with corals of strange hue and with precious stones of
great value, with pearls without comparison;

Shlok 18: Reddish and resembling gold, together with sandal wood having a good smell and
brilliant like the Sun at noon;

Shlok 19: The great Hanuma alighted the best aeroplane called Pushpaka with an excellent form
decorated by rows of upper floors.

Shlok 20: That Hanuma then being there, smelled a wonderful sweet fragrance like wind with an
appearance, created from drinks and foods, including cooked rice diffused on all sides.

Shlok 21: That sweet smell was as though saying thus to that Hanuma : "Come here!", like a
relative to a best relative pointing to there wherever that Ravana was.

Shlok 22: Hanuma started thereafter there (in that direction) and saw an auspicious great
hall, close to heart of Ravana, like a delightful best woman.

Shlok 23: That hall was made of stairways embedded with diamonds, decorated with golden
windows, with a floor embellished with crystal, with shapes made from ivory in the middle.

Shlok 24: Well decorated with pearls, corals and also with silver and gold and with diamond
studded pillars and also decorated with many pillars.

all over, that hall was as though starting for sky with very high wings.

mountains, oceans, forests, painted over, that hall was like the vast earth together with states
and rows of houses.

Shlok 27: It was resounded by birds in heat, made fragrant by excellent perfumes, hung with
best tapestries and inhabited by the king of rakshasas

Shlok 28: It was made smokey by the fumes of agallocum. It was a pure one white like a swan,
wonderful by the decoration of flowers, like divine cow with a great radiance.

Shlok 29: That excellent hall was causing happiness to heart, causing a fair complexion,
destroying sorrow and was as though producing prosperity.

Shlok 30: Like a mother, then that hall governed by Ravana caused satisfaction to all five
sensory organs with all the excellent five objects of the senses.

Shlok 31: Hanuma thought thus : "This is heaven! This is indeed the abode of Devas! This is a
city of Indra. This might be the result of a great austerity."

Shlok 32: Like gamblers defeated by greater gamblers in gambling, Hanuma saw golden hued lamps
being still, as though in thought.

Shlok 33: Hanuma thought thus : "This building shines by the light of lamps and the brilliance
of Ravana and also due to the radiance of jewellery."

Shlok 34: Thereafter Hanuma saw a thousand of best women sitting on the rug with clothing of
various colours and decorated in a variety of ways.

Shlok 35: Then at the turn of midnight, those women slept deeply resting after playing during
night, with a deep sleep caused by liquor.

Shlok 36: That sleeping group of women, adorned with jewels which were not making sound, shone
like a great park of lotuses with calm swans and bees.

Shlok 37: Hanuma saw faces of those best women, with teeth covered by lips with closed eyes
and with lotus fragrance.

Shlok 38: At that time, those faces shone which became like lotuses in blossom during day time
and again were like lotuses with closed petals at night.

Shlok 39: Hanuma thought that drunk bees definitely are desiring again and again these lotus
faces like lotuses in blossom.

Shlok 40: The glorious great Hanuma thought as above by recourse to reason. He also thought
thus "Those faces equal lotuses by their qualities such as beauty, fragrance, and others".

Shlok 41: That hall of Ravana's being shone by those women, glittered like a calm cloudless
sky in autumn shone by stars.

Shlok 42: That lord of Rakshasas surrounded by those women shone like the radiant moon
surrounded by stars.

Shlok 43: Then Hanuma thought thus : "Whatever meteors together with residue of piety fall
down from the sky, all those meteors had been together as these women".

Shlok 44: There the luster, complexion and grace of those women clearly resembled great stars
which emitted an auspicious radience.

Shlok 45: Those women with dishevelled large thick garlands and scattered excellent jewels
during the time of drinking, dancing etc., were with consciousness stolen by sleep.

Shlok 46: Best women with disturbed sacred marks (tilaka) on forehead became with displaced
anklets, became with necklaces fallen off to side.

Shlok 47: Some other women became tied with pearl necklaces, some others became with tied-up
waist ornaments (and) resembled young female horses who had walked long.

Shlok 48: Some others wearing nice earrings with flower garlands that were torn and disturbed,
resembled creepers, tread upon by an elephant in a big forest.

Shlok 49: Big pearl necklaces with the radiance of moon-rays in the middle of breasts of some
other women shone like sleeping swans.

Shlok 50: And of some other women, necklaces made with cat's eye gems resembled birds called
Kadambas and for some others golden chains were like Chakravaka birds.

Shlok 51: Those women with buttocks resembling sand dunes, shone like rivers filled with swans
and birds called Karandas and decorated by Chakravaka birds.

Shlok 52: Those sleeping women shone like rivers with their smiles as flower buds, with golden
jewellery as big lotuses, with their behaviours as crocodiles, with fame as banks.

Shlok 53: Auspicious lines of decoration which were on smooth parts of some other women and on
nipples, were like jewellery.

Shlok 54: Edges of clothing (worn by them) disturbed by air from breathing of some other
women, were being fluttered again and again on their faces.

Shlok 55: Those edges of clothes with various beautiful colours, shone at the base of Ravana's
wives' throats like hoisted flags of beautiful shine.

Shlok 56: Here ear-rings of some beautiful women with a good glory, also moved lightly due to
the air from breathing of those women.

Shlok 57: Then comforting breath from the faces of those women, by nature fragrant with the
smell of liquor made of Sarkara, served Ravana.

Shlok 58: Some women of Ravana smelled co-wives' faces again and again imagining them to be
face of Ravana.

Shlok 59: Those best women with greatly devoted mind in Ravana, then not being on own will,
brought delight only to their co-wives.

Shlok 60: Some other women slept there, making as pillows their arms decorated with bracelets
and beautiful clothes.

Shlok 61: Another woman slept on another's bosom, again another woman slept on her shoulder,
another woman slept on another woman's thigh and another slept on her breasts.

Shlok 62: Overcome with heat and friendship, they resorted to thighs, sides, waist and back of
one another, with mutual limbs placed on one another.

Shlok 63: That garland of women tied with the rope of each other's shoulders shone like a
flower garland with dragon flies on it tied in thread.

Shlok 64-65: That group of women of Ravana, tied by each other as garland with mixed group of
flowers, with beautiful shoulders entwined promiscuously, hair like an exalted garden with a flower
garland tied together of creepers in bloom due to the caress of the lord of wind in the vernal in
the month of Vaisakha, with entwined beautiful trees.

Shlok 66: Then it was not possible to make clear the knowledge of jewellery, body parts and
clothes of those women even for those used to them.

Shlok 67: While Ravana slept comfortably, golden lamps shining brilliant, were as though
seeing without closing eyes, those women of various glows.

Shlok 68: Women of royal sages, brahmanas and demons and of Gandharvas, of Rakshasas - all
those unmarried girls surrendered from lust to Ravana.

Shlok 69: All those women had been stolen by Ravana with a desire for war, some together with
heat of youth obtained Ravana being desired by god of love.

Shlok 70: There, even one woman had not been obtained forcefully by the strong Ravana, except
for that daughter of Janaka, Seetha. Every other woman had been obtained by her character alone and
there was no woman who had desire in another man, and there also was none with another lover.

Shlok 71: And there was no wife of his without a good lineage, there was no one with less
beauty, no one without skill, no one without service, none with low intellect, no one without
causing desire to lover.

Shlok 72: Following thought occurred to Hanuma with a pious mind : "It would have been good
for this Ravana if the virtuous wife of Rama had been left happy with her husband in the same such
manner as these wives of the king of rakshasas."

Shlok 73: Hanuma became gloomy and thought thus: "Seetha is definitely the best by virtues;
then this lord of Lanka even though being great otherwise, did an evil and an un-gentlemanly deed
with her.



Thus, this is the 9th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic
poem of India.

equaling Rama even among gods. This is another woman - thus deciding that Hanuma paced in that banqueting hall.

Shlok 4: Some women were tired from erotic dalliance and then some other women were tired from singing; 
some others were weary from dance and were unconscious from consumption of liquor.

Shlok 5: Some women were stationed on tabors, on Mrudangas, on seats, some other women rested on chief carpets.

Shlok 6-7: The warrior among Vanaras saw a thousand of women decorated by jewellery with a nature of talking 
about beauty, conversing about the correct meaning of songs being sung, behaving according to time and place, 
wont to speak appropriate words, indulged in sleep after sexual dalliance.

Shlok 8: In the middle of that group of women, Ravana with great arms shone like a bull in the middle of 
cows in a big cow-pen.

Shlok 9: That Ravana himself surrounded by those women, shone like a great elephant surrounded by she elephants 
in a great forest.

Shlok 10: The best among Vanaras saw in that wealthy Ravana's house a bar also, consisting of all desirables.

Shlok 11: Hanuma saw there in that bar, meat of dear and of buffalo, of wild boar kept separately.

Shlok 12: The best among Vanaras saw half eaten peacocks and chicken in wide vessels of golden colour.

Shlok 13: Hanuma observed meat of pigs and goats, porcupines, deer and peacocks preserved in curds and sochal 
salt.

Shlok 14-15: Hanuma saw birds called Krakara cooked ready to be eaten in variety of ways, birds called Chakoras 
half eaten, wild buffalos, fishes called ekashleya, goats, food to be licked of various kinds, beverages and various 
foods.

Shlok 16- 17: In the same way that floor was obtaining glory greatly with Ragas and Shadabas seasoned with sour 
and salty sauces, with necklaces, anklets and armlets of great value thrown around, with various fruits left in 
drinking vessels, with flowers sprinkled.

Shlok 18: That bar was seen as though radiant without fire, with couches and chairs well arranged and placed 
there and there.

Shlok 19: Many meats of different kinds cultured with various best seasonings, well arranged separately obtained 
that bar.

Shlok 20: Excellent and clear various liquors, a liquor called Sura, liquor made of sugar, liquor made of 
honey, liquor made of flowers and liquors made of fruits also, artificially made liquors - those and those were 
cultured separately with various fragrant powders.

Shlok 21-22: The floor shone filled by flower garlands in a variety of forms, with various vessels of golden 
hue and also made of crystal, filled with other small vessels of golden colour.

Shlok 23: Hanuma saw indeed then lot of best quality liquor in pots of silver and of golden colour.

Shlok 24: That great Hanuma saw vessels full of liquor of golden colour, embedded with gem stones and also 
of silver hue.

Shlok 25: That Hanuma saw indeed at some places drinks half filled and at some places completely drunk and 
some places not at all drunk.

Shlok 26: Hanuma paced about seeing at some places various eatables and at some places drinks separately, 
and at some places remnants of cooked rice.

Shlok 27: Hanuma saw some places with vessels broken, some places with pots in shambles, some places with 
water together with flower garlands and fruits.

Shlok 28: Here couches again of women were varied and clean, some best women slept there hugging one another.

Shlok 29: Some women conquered by the power of sleep pulled other sleeping women's clothing and slept covering 
themselves.

Shlok 30: Clothing and garland on the throats of those women was moving slightly and wonderfully as though 
obtaining air from the air of breath.

Shlok 31: There wind blew carrying in a lot of directions, a variety of fragrances of cool sandal-paste and 
of sweet liquor, of various flower garlands and of various kinds of agallocum fumes.

Shlok 32: Then the blossoming fragrance from the baths and sandal paste and from agallocum fumes blew spreading 
all around in that Pushpaka plane.

Shlok 33: There in that Ravana's house, some women had fair and white complexion some best women were black, 
some women had a body of golden complexion.

Shlok 34: Appearance of those sleeping women, tired from being possessed by sleep and from lust, was like 
lotuses sleeping.

Shlok 35: Hanuma with great radiance thus saw entire Ravana's house completely but did not see Seetha.

Shlok 36: Then that Hanuma seeing those women obtained great anguish being in doubt because of fear in the 
matter of dharma.

Shlok 37: "My seeing sleeping house of other people's wives will do a great deficit to dharma."

Shlok 38: "My sight is indeed not in the matter of other wives here. These other's wives have been seen by 
me."

Shlok 39: To that Hanuma with an excellent mind, with a fixed and concentrated mind, was born another thought 
again, showing a fixed resolve in the task at hand.

Shlok 40: "All Ravana's women who were in faith could have been seen by me; to my mind there indeed was not 
even a little disturbance".

Shlok 41: "Among auspicious or inauspicious states in the behavior of all senses mind is the reason. My that 
mind is very steady."

Shlok 42: "By me it is not possible to search Seetha at another place. Always during search women will be 
seen among other women."

Shlok 43: "To an animal of whatever race that animal is searched in that race; a woman missing is not possible 
to be searched among female deer."

Shlok 44: "For that reason all this Ravana's house has been search by me with a pure mind Seetha alone cannot 
be seen."

Shlok 45: The strong Hanuma observing girls from devas, gandharvas and girls from nagas did not see Janaki.

Shlok 46: The powerful Hanuma not seeing Her there and seeing other best women then started to think deeply 
going far from there.

Shlok 47: That Hanuma the glorious one adopting a great task again left that bar and began to search that 
house.



SARGA 12
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Hanuma gets discouraging thoughts about Seetha. He thinks that Seetha might be 
dead. He thus gets into depression for a moment.

Shlok 1: That Hanuma interested in sight of Seetha, in the middle of that building, went towards houses 
made of plant creepers, art houses, and nocturnal houses but did not see Her with a beautiful appearance.

Shlok 2: That great Hanuma then later not seeing that Seetha dear to Rama thought thus: "to me searching 
Seetha in whatever way appearance not being obtained, from that Seetha definitely has died."

Shlok 3: "That Seetha standing in the best traditional path being chaste interested, in preserving her character 
must have been killed by the king of these Rakshasas who performed evil deeds - this is certain."

Shlok 4: "That daughter of King Janaka died of fear seeing the wives of Ravana with crooked appearances 
- horrible ones without radiance with great faces with long and crooked eyes."

Shlok 5: "Without seeing Seetha, not obtaining destiny and wandering for a long time together with Vanaras, 
to me there is not a path to go near Sugreeva. Sugreeva has a sharp punishment and also is strong."

Shlok 6: "All inner city has been seen. Women of Ravana have been seen. The chaste Seetha has not been seen. 
My effort became wastefull."

Shlok 7: "To me who has gone back all Vanaras after meeting what they would say? O strong one! Going there, 
what has been done by you? Tell that to us."

Shlok 8: "Without seeing that Seetha what can I say? Due to passing of time, definitely they will obtain 
fire."

Shlok 9: "To me who had gone for the other shore of the ocean what will the old Jambavan say? What would 
that Angada and vanaras who meet say?"

Shlok 10: "Non-depression is root of development. Absence of despondency is the greatest comfort. Self reliance 
always is indeed the promoter in all matters."

Shlok 11: "Whatever action a human does that action of man is made to be successful by non-depression. For 
that reason I will perform a best effort together with non-depression. I will search all those regions ruled by 
Ravana not yet seen."

Shlok 12-13: "Bars have been searched; in the same way flower houses, art houses have been searched; again pleasure 
houses, pathways in the middle of gardens, buildings in all directions have been searched."

Shlok 14: Thus thinking Hanuma began to search again undergrounds, houses at the beginning of street intersections 
and also small houses faraway from the main houses.

Shlok 15-16: The great Hanuma flying again and again and jumping down, standing up, walking, opening doors, 
pushing doors and entering inside, coming out, climbing down, climbing up wandered all opportunity.

Shlok 17: That Hanuma in that city of Ravana - whatever region he did not go that region was not there even 
for four angulas.

Shlok 18: Streets between fort walls, platforms together with the intersection of four streets, wells, lakes 
all these had been seen by him.

Shlok 19: Rakshasa women of various forms, with crooked forms and horrific forms had been seen there by Hanuma 
but not that Seetha.

Shlok 20: The best Vidhyadhara women incomparable by beauty in the world had been seen there by Hanuma, but 
not Seetha.

Shlok 21: Naaga women with beautiful buttocks, with faces equaling full moon had been seen by Hanuma there, 
but not Seetha with a beautiful waist.

Shlok 22: Naaga women who had been stolen forcefully, being defeated by Ravana had been seen there by Hanuma, 
not that Seetha

Shlok 23: That Hanuma with great arms, the wise one, the son of Vayu not seeing that Seetha and seeing other 
women became depressed again and again.

Shlok 24: Seeing the effort of the best Vanaras and the crossing of ocean as being wasted, Hanuma got depression 
again.

Shlok 25: Thereafter the son of Vayu Hanuma got down from Pushpaka, obtained thought with a mind overcome 
with grief.



SARGA 13
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Hanuma starts to search for Seetha overcoming the depression. He begins to go towards 
Ashoka garden to continue his search.

Shlok 1: Hanuma the leader of Vanaras crossed from pushpaka toward the fort wall and became with speed like 
lighting in the middle of a cloud.

Shlok 2: The simian Hanuma went far from the house of Ravana and not seeing Seetha, the daughter of King 
Janaka, said these words:

Shlok 3: "The city of Lanka has been mostly explored by me attempting for the pleasure of Rama. But I am 
unable to see Seetha, beautiful in all limbs, and the daughter of Videha."

Shlok 4: "All earth consisting of pools, ponds, lakes and streams, rivers and forest areas filled with water, 
mountains difficult of access have been explored but I did not see Seetha."

Shlok 5: "It has been said by the eagle King Sampati that Seetha is here in the house of Ravana. I am unable 
to see her."

Shlok 6: "Otherwise Seetha belonging to Videha born in Mithila and daughter of king Janaka - Can she be 
helplessly together with the evil minded Ravana."

Shlok 7: "I think while Ravana fearing Rama's arrows flew quickly carrying Seetha, she might have fallen 
down in the middle of the journey."

Shlok 8: "Or I think the heart of the noble Seetha being stolen in the path served by Siddhas must have 
sunk at the site of the ocean."

Shlok 9: "I think due to great speed of Ravana and due to the torture of Ravana's shoulders the life has 
been given up by that noble one with wide eyes."

Shlok 10: "Then while being flown upon the surface of the ocean, Seetha definitely fell down in the ocean 
while wriggling."

Shlok 11: "Or has the austere Seetha been eaten by this Ravana, the evil minded one while she was protecting 
her chastity without any relatives near her."

Shlok 12: "Otherwise not being evil with black eyes, She may have been eaten by the wives of Ravana with 
evil thoughts."

Shlok 13: "The pitiable Seetha equaling full moon, with eyes equaling lotus petals must have obtained death 
while meditating upon Rama's face."

Shlok 14: "The daughter of Videha, Seetha. ï¿½O Rama!' ï¿½O Lakshmana!' ï¿½O Ayodhya!', thus weeping greatly may 
have given up her body."

Shlok 15: "I think otherwise being put in the house of Ravana Seetha is definitely crying like a caged myna."

Shlok 16: "How can the daughter of King Janaka, Rama's wife Seetha with a beautiful waist, with eyes like 
black lotus petals obtain Ravana's capture."

Shlok 17: "It is not fair to let know Rama who has a dear wife if Seetha is lost or is not to be seen or 
has died."

Shlok 18: "To be let known becomes an error; not to let know becomes an error how to perform the duty? To 
me this seems dire situation."

Shlok 19: "This task while it goes this way the time is approaching. What becomes appropriate" thus Hanuma 
thought again this view point.

Shlok 20: "If I go towards Sugreeva's city from here without seeing Seetha from that to what avail will this 
effort be?"

Shlok 21: "My crossing of the ocean entering the city of Lanka the site of rakshasas - all this will become 
waste."

Shlok 22: "To me reaching Kishkindha what would Sugreeva say or Vanaras there or those sons of Dasharatha 
what would they say?"

Shlok 23: "Going there by me for Rama, ï¿½Seetha has not been seen' - thus if I say a very unpleasant word 
thereafter Rama will give up life."

Shlok 24: "Hearing bad word belonging to Seetha that is harsh, horrible, cruel, sharp, sense agonizing, He 
will not exist."

Shlok 25: "Seeing that Rama being with troubles, being with a heart towards death, Lakshmana, one with great 
love and an intellectual will not exist."

Shlok 26: "Hearing brothers to be dead, Bharata also will die. Seeing the dead Bharata, Shatrughana also 
will not exist."

Shlok 27: "Thereafter seeing sons to be dead the mothers Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi will not exist - there 
is no doubt."

Shlok 28: "Grateful, true to pledge Sugreeva, the leader of Vanaras, seeing Rama the leader of Vanaras seeing 
Rama die in that way will give up life thereafter."

Shlok 29: "Being tortured by the sorrow of husband, made sad by a gloomy heart, disconsolate without happiness, 
to be pitied, Ruma will give up life."

Shlok 30: "Being distressed from the sorrow of Vali, being emaciated from grief, Tara also will not exist 
while the king Sugreeva is obtaining death."

Shlok 31: "The young Angada also from the death of mother and father, from the grief of Sugreeva - why will 
he retain life?"

Shlok 32: "Vanaras being rejected by the sorrow due to their lord will strike their heads with palms and 
fists."

Shlok 33: "Vanaras loved by the famous king Sugreeva through good words, through small gifts, through respect 
will give up lives."

Shlok 34: "Best among Vanaras will not enjoy together sport in forest, not on mountains, not again in covered 
places."

Shlok 35: "Together with wife and children and together with ministers being tortured by grief of their lord, 
they will fall down from top of mountains on to flat lands and on to rugged lands."

Shlok 36: "Vanaras will perform death by taking poison or getting hanged or entering fire or fasting or a 
weapon."

Shlok 37: "While I am going I think about the destruction of Ikshvaaku dynasty and destruction of Vanaras 
and there will be a terrible wail."

Shlok 38: "I will not go from here to the Kishkindha city. I am not capable to see Sugreeva without Seetha."

Shlok 39: "I while not going, being here those virtuous ones, those great warriors those two Rama and Lakshmana 
will live by hope. Vanaras also who are agile will live."

Shlok 40- 41: "Without seeing Seetha subsisting on whatever falls on hand, whatever comes to mouth, being self 
restrained I will become a hermit living on trees and herbs at a region near ocean which has many roots, fruits 
and much water."

Shlok 42: "Or I will enter fire which is glowing after making a funeral pile or while sitting performing 
fasting onto death my body will be eaten by crows and by beasts of prey."

Shlok 43: "This way to giving up body has been seen by sages. This is my opinion if I do not see Seetha, 
I will enter lot of water."

Shlok 44: "Not seeing Seetha, my garland of glory of long time with a strong foundation, beautiful one together 
with fame has been destroyed."

Shlok 45: "I will become a hermit who is self restrained resorting to trees and herbs, I will not go from 
here not seeing Seetha with black eyes."

Shlok 46: "If I go back from here without knowing that Seetha, there will not be Angada together with all 
those Vanaras."

Shlok 47: "There are lots of blemishes in dying; one who is alive sees auspicious things. For that reason 
I will keep my life. It is definite for the meeting of people who are alive."

Shlok 48: Hanuma carrying in mind sorrow of various kinds again and again did not get then the crossing of 
sorrow.

Shlok 49: "Otherwise I will kill Ravana with ten heads, with great prowess. Whatever happened to the stolen 
Seetha, this will be revenge to that."

Shlok 50: "Otherwise carrying this Ravana over the surface of ocean I will take him to Rama like an animal 
to the lord of animals."

Shlok 51: Hanuma not seeing that Seetha thus begetting sorrow, thought with a mind cluttered with thoughts 
and sorrow.

Shlok 52: "To wherever I see Seetha, the wife of Sri Rama and one with fame, till there I will search the 
city of Lanka again and again."

Shlok 53: "Based on words of Sampati if I bring Sri Rama then Sri Rama not seeing wife will burn all Vanaras."

Shlok 54: "With limited food and with restrained senses, I live here itself. By my deed those men and vanaras 
- let they not be destroyed."

Shlok 55: "Whatever this Ashoka garden with great trees is being seen this I will obtain. This has not been 
searched by me."

Shlok 56: "Saluting the eight Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, the two Aswinis, seven Maruts, I will go to increase 
the grief of Rakshasas."

Shlok 57: "Defeating all rakshasas, I will give Seetha, who gives happiness to Ikshvaaku dynasty to Sri Rama 
as the fruit of austerity to an ascetic."

Shlok 58: The gloried son of Vayu that Hanuma got up with his senses tied by grief.

Shlok 59: "Let there be salutations to Sri Rama together with Lakshmana, also to that, who is divine let 
there be salutations. To Rudra, Indra, Yama and Vaayu let there be salutations."

Shlok 60: That Hanuma saluting to all those and also to Sugreeva, observing all directions went towards Ashoka 
garden.

Shlok 61: The son of Vayu, that Vanara went by mind before itself toward that Ashoka garden. The auspicious 
one pondered the task to be done later.

Shlok 62: "The Ashoka garden definitely will be with many rakshasas, filled with trees, adorned with various 
cultures and sacred."

Shlok 63: "There definitely guards will be protecting assigned, trees, omnipresent Lord Vayu also will be 
blowing by without force, and by me this body has been made small for the sake of Sri Rama and to avoid Ravana."

Shlok 64-65-66-67: "Devas together with ascetics will make success to me here, self born Brahma the divine one and 
devas and Agni and Vaayu, Devendra wearing the weapon of Vajra and Varuna with Pasha in hand and also the Sun 
and the moon and the aswinis. The great ones Maruts and Eshwara may give my success. Whoever is the lord of all 
living creatures among all living beings others who being unseen exist in the path may give success to me."

Shlok 68: "When will I see that noble face with a high nose, with white teeth without any injuries with a 
bright smile, with eyes resembling lotus petals with sight equaling the splendor of clear full moon?"

Shlok 69: "How that powerless Seetha, a helpless one, forcefully taken away by the mean vile Ravana with 
a cruel action, with a horribly decorated form will fall in the range of my sight today."



SARGA 14
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma enters the Ashoka garden and observes its beauty. He starts looking for Seetha in the garden. 
He thinks that Seetha would definitely come to that garden if she were to be alive.

Shlok 1: That Hanuma with great resplendence thought for a moment, obtained that Ashoka garden by mind and 
jumped from the compound wall of that house.

Shlok 2-3: That great Hanuma with joyful limbs, being on enclosure wall saw various trees such as Sal, beautiful 
Ashoka, Champaka full of flowers, Uddalaka, Naga, mango trees with their fruit in the colour of the snout of a 
monkey, in full blossom at the start of the spring.

Shlok 4: Thereafter Hanuma flew like a Naracha arrow released from bow string, toward the garden covered 
by mango trees and surrounded by hundreds of creepers.

Shlok 5-6-7-8: That Hanuma the simian, saw on entering that garden filled with happy humans, animals and birds 
with varied hues during spring, resounded by birds, with trees made of silver, made of gold, surrounded everywhere 
by birds and groups of animals; wonderful with wonderful trees equaling the Sun at sunrise together with trees 
of various kinds which obtained flowers and fruits, served daily by Cuckoos and by dragon flies, resounded by 
peacocks in heat and with groups of birds of various kinds.

Shlok 9: Hanuma searching the royal daughter Seetha with excellent limbs and without blame, woke up birds 
in comfortable sleep.

Shlok 10: Trees hit by wings of groups of birds in flight shed showers of flowers of various colours and 
of various kinds.

Shlok 11: The son of Lord Vayu, Hanuma sprinkled with flowers shone like a mountain of flowers in the middle 
of Ashoka garden.

Shlok 12: Seeing Hanuma running in all directions and being in the middle of trees, all living creatures 
thought Him to be Vasanta, the lord of spring.

Shlok 13: There the Earth sprinkled by flowers of various kinds which fell down from trees shone like a well 
decorated woman.

Shlok 14: Then those trees, shaken by the might of Hanuma the mighty one, showered wonderful flowers.

Shlok 15: The trees with their branches, removed leaves with fallen down fruits and flowers were like defeated 
gamblers with their clothes and jewellery kept down.

Shlok 16: The excellent trees shining with best flowers fell down instantly flowers, leaves and fruits.

Shlok 17: All those trees losing groups of birds became being a resort to branches only like trees shook 
by wind.

Shlok 18-19: Hit by Hanuma's tail, hands and feet, Ashoka garden with broken best trees became like a young 
woman with disturbed hair, with effaced sandal paste, with her auspicious teeth and lips drunk from and wounded 
by nails and by teeth.

Shlok 20: Hanuma broke circles of great creepers by His might like the wind during rainy season, breaking 
the groups of clouds of mountain Vindhya.

Shlok 21: That Hanuma pacing there saw diamond studded floors, silver inlaid floors, and beautiful gold inlaid 
floors.

Shlok 22-26: Hanuma saw ponds filled with the best waters, together there and there with stairs embedded with 
diamonds of great value, with pearls and corals as sand, with bottoms made of crystal and precious stones, shone 
by trees of golden hue and of wonderful hue at banks containing beds of lotuses in full blossom and lilies, resounded 
by chakravaka birds nearby, sounded by water fowls, resounded by swans and cranes, together with tall trees, with 
nectar like waters, with hundreds of auspicious creepers, covered by the flowers of santaana trees, surrounded 
by various shrubs with middle regions of karaveera and also wells and in various shapes.

Shlok 27-28: Thereafter the monkey warrior Hanuma saw a mountain which was a beautiful mountain in the world, 
equaling cloud with high peaks, with wonderful peaks surrounded in all directions by peaks, spread by caves and 
covered by different trees.

Shlok 29-31: Hanuma saw river which fell down from the mountain like a beloved (young wife) who fell down after 
jumping from the lap of a loved one shone by trees whose ends fell down in water or like a woman in anger being 
detained by her near and dear. That great Hanuma again saw that river with water, turning back like a beloved 
woman reaching her beloved again, being reconciled to her beloved one.

Shlok 32: The best among vanaras and the son of Vayu, that Hanuma saw near to that mountain, lotus ponds 
together with many groups of birds.

Shlok 33-34: He also saw an artificial pond filled with cold water, with steps embedded with best diamonds, 
shone by the sand of pearls, wonderful forest with very big buildings made by Vishwakarma, with groups of artificial 
trees decorated in all directions.

Shlok 35: There whatever trees were there with flowers and fruits, all those were together with umbrellas, 
together with big platforms and with smaller golden platforms.

Shlok 36-37: The monkey warrior Hanuma saw one shimshupaa tree golden in colour covered with many groups of 
creepers and with many leaves surrounded everywhere with platforms made of gold.

Shlok 38: Hanuma saw lands, mountain springs, and some other golden trees equal to fire.



Then the courageous Hanuma thought thus: "Like the sun by the radiance of Mount Meru, by the radiance 
of those trees, I am of golden colour."

Shlok 40: Seeing that shimshupaa tree with groups of trees of golden colour blown by the wind, with the sound 
of hundreds of tinkle bells, Hanuma got surprised.

Shlok 41: Hanuma with great arms climbing up that shimshupaa tree with well flowered ends, beautiful tree, 
mature with young shoots and leaves and covered by leaves (thought thus).

Shlok 42: "I will see by God's grace, Seetha who is interested in the sight of Sri Rama while she is moving 
here and there with grief."

Shlok 43: This Ashoka garden of evil-souled Ravana is definitely beautiful; it is well decorated by Champaka 
trees, by sandal trees and by Vakula trees.



"This pond also served by groups of birds is beautiful; that wife of Sri Rama definitely will come 
for this pond."

Shlok 45: "The wife of Sri Rama dear to Sri Rama, a chaste wife, soul captivating one, expert at moving in 
forest, that Janaki will definitely come."

Shlok 46: "Otherwise one with the eyes of a deer, emaciated by the thought of Sri Rama, that noble one will 
come for this garden."



"Tortured by grief for Sri Rama, with beautiful eyes, interested always living in the garden, that 
Devi moving about in the garden will come."

Shlok 48: "The beloved wife of Sri Rama, the daughter of king Janaka, the chaste wife, earlier always was 
interested the denizens of the garden. This is true."

Shlok 49: "The ever youthful one with the best complexion, Seetha interested in the rites of Sandhya time 
will definitely come to this river with the auspicious water for Sandhya rite."

Shlok 50: "Whoever Seetha, the auspicious wife, a dear one of Sri Rama, the king of kings, to that Seetha 
this Ashoka garden, an auspicious one, is well suited also."

Shlok 51: "That Devi with the face like that of the moon, if alive, she definitely will come for this river 
with auspicious water."

Shlok 52: The great-souled Hanuma thus thinking being concealed in the mass of well flowered leaves saw everything 
observing everywhere.



SARGA 15
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma continues his search in the Ashoka garden for Seetha. He sees an emaciated woman surrounded 
	by demonesses. From Her radiance and manner of clothing etc, Hanuma recognizes Her to be Seetha.

Shlok 1: That Hanuma being there, seeing and searching for Seetha, observing all that land, explored 
	the garden.

Shlok 2-8: That Hanuma being there observed closely that Ashoka garden shone by Santanaka creepers, Santana 
	trees with heavenly aroma and juice, well decorated in all directions equalling the garden of Nandana, surrounded 
	by animals and birds, congested with mansions and palaces, resounded with the notes of cuckoos, decorated 
	with wells having golden water lilies, lotuses and with many chairs and carpets; with many sub-terrain houses, 
	beautiful trees, with trees with flowers of all seasons and with fruit, with the radiance of raising sun, 
	by the glory of ashoka trees in bloom, as though radiant as though being made to be with branches without 
	leaves, by hundreds of birds perching again and again, Ashoka trees with wonderful flowers as head decoration, 
	with flowers spread till the roots destroying leaves, with weight of groups of flowers as touching the earth 
	with karnolaara trees; in blossom with Kimkusa trees in full blossom.

Shlok 9: By the radiance of those trees that region was as though lit in all directions. Punnaaga trees 
	with flatted roots and in full blossom, Saptaparna trees Campaka and Uddalaka trees were shining.

Shlok 10: There in that garden of Ashoka there were thousands of Ashoka trees some equalling gold, some 
	equalling fire, some equalling the precious stone Niila and Anjana.

Shlok 11-14: Like the garden of Nandana, a celestial garden, wonderful like Caitraratham, a garden of Kubera, 
	surpassing all, unfathomable, an excellent one, a beautiful one consisting of glory together with flowers 
	like clusters of stars, like a second sky wonderful with flowers, like hundreds of diamonds, like a second 
	ocean with flowers of all seasons, spread with trees having the smell of honey, beautiful with groups of animals 
	of various sounds, diffused with many smells with an auspicious soul pleasing smell.

Shlok 15-18a: That monkey warrior Hanuma saw not far away in that Ashoka garden, in the middle, a lofty temple 
	filled with fragrance like a second Gandhamadana Mountain, standing by a thousand pillars, white like Mount 
	Kailaasa with stairs made of corals with platforms made of refined gold as though radiant with glory, clear 
	and because of being tall as though scraping the sky.

Shlok 18b-19: Thereafter Hanuma saw Seetha wearing a soiled garment, surrounded by rakshasa women, emaciated 
	due to fasting, looking miserable, sighing again and again, like the pure crescent moon at the beginning of 
	a bright fortnight.

Shlok 20: With a form that slowly came out like a tongue of fire, of beautiful radiance covered by smoke.

Shlok 21: Covered by a single best cloth of yellow colour, which was wrinkled, without any decorations 
	like a lotus plant without lotuses, together with mud.

Shlok 22: Bashful, tortured by sorrow worn out in a pitiable condition like the constellation Rohini,

	surrounded by group of hounds.

Shlok 25-26a: With a braid with the radiance of a single black serpent reaching hinder part, like the earth 
	with dark green groups of trees during the end of rainy season, deserving of comforts, tormented by grief, 
	not accustomed to calamities.

Shlok 26b-27a: Observing that woman with wide eyes, very untidy, emaciated, Hanuma thought that this is indeed 
	Seetha on logical grounds.

Shlok 27b-28a: Then, while being abducted by that rakshasa with the ability to assume desired form in whatever 
	way, She was seen, this woman has the same form.

Shlok 28b-29: Hanuma saw Seetha with a face like full moon, with beautiful eyebrows, with graceful rounded 
	breasts, by the radiance making all directions without darkness, goddess like with black hair, with lips like 
	bimba fruit, with a good waist, very firm, with eyes like lotus petals, like Rati the consort of god of love.

	on bare ground with a good body.

Shlok 31b-32a: Sighing a lot like the consort of lord of serpents in fright, not radiant by sorrow which was 
	great and extensive.

Shlok 32: Hanuma saw Her like a tongue of fire mixed with column of smoke, like an intellect together 
	with doubts, like a cast away treasure.

Shlok 33: Like shattered faith, like frustrated hope, like success together with obstacles, like an impure 
	mind.

Shlok 34: Like fame that has fallen down by a false scandal, tortured by the obstruction caused to Rama, 
	emaciated due to the abduction by Ravana.

Shlok 35b-36: With eyes like those of a young doe full of tears, with black and oblique eye-brows, with a 
	cheerless countenance, seeing there and there, being helpless, sighing again and again.

Shlok 37: Wearing a coat of dust, pitiable one, although suited for decorations undecorated, like the 
	radiance of the moon, the lord of stars, covered by black clouds.

Shlok 38: Seeing Seetha like knowledge in ruin for want of repeated study, that Hanuma's mind got repeatedly 
	doubtful.

Shlok 39: Hanuma recognized with great sorrow Seetha not decorated, like a sentence which got a different 
	meaning being devoid of culture.

Shlok 40: Seeing that princess, the wide eyed one, blameless one, Hanuma reasoned her to be Seetha for 
	the following reasons.

Shlok 41-42-43a: Then Hanuma saw whatever groups of jewellery of Seetha on various parts Rama spoke, those charming 
	Her limbs, well made earrings, well fitting Svadamstras and ornaments wonderful with diamonds on the limbs 
	of Her hands, belonging to body for long time, blackened and making marks on body.

Shlok 43b-44: "I think all these to be same about which Rama spoke; among them whatever have been worn out 
	those I will not see; whatever jewels of Her are not worn out these are they - no doubt."

Shlok 45: That upper garment yellow with a shine like a golden plate, auspicious one, being dropped had 
	been seen caught in a tree then by vanaras.

Shlok 46: "Dropped on the earth by Her, ornaments also great and important, those making sound have been 
	seen."

Shlok 47: "This cloth being worn for a long time has worn out a lot, even then definitely it is of the 
	same colour, like the other upper garment; in the same way this is glorious."

Shlok 48: "This She of golden colour is indeed Rama's dear wife; who ever Seetha the chaste one, even 
	though not seen, is not gone from Rama's heart."

Shlok 49-50: "This is She for whose sake Rama tormented in four ways from compassion from pity from grief 
	from love; (thinking that) a woman has disappeared from compassion, depending on him from pity, wife has been 
	lost from grief, a dear one from love."

Shlok 51: "In whatever way is this lady's appearance, elegance of major and minor limbs, in the same 
	way is Rama's. In whatever way His appearance, in the same way is this black-eyed one's appearance."

Shlok 52: "This lady's heart is in Rama, His heart is firmly in Her, for that reason She and that noble 
	Rama are able to live even for a moment."

Shlok 53: "Lord Rama losing Her has done an impossible task in that He still preserved His body, in that 
	He did not die from grief."

Shlok 54: Hanuma, then seeing Seetha became happy thus and went by mind to Rama and also praised that 
	Lord.

you desire obtaining disappearance of self due to fear.

Shlok 3: "O wide eyed one! You are endowed with bodily excellencies, pleasing to all people. I desire you. 
O lovable one! respect me."

Shlok 4: "O Seetha! Here there are no humans or ogres with ability to change form. Let your fear caused 
due to me be removed."

Shlok 5: "O one with fear! Obtaining women belonging to others or abducting by force is the righteous deed 
for ogres by all means. There is no doubt in this."

Shlok 6: "O Seetha! It is like this. desire very much may behave in whatever way it likes in my body. But 
I will not touch you without lust."

Shlok 7: "O queen of my heart! In this matter fear is not to be made. O love! Believe in me. Truly become 
with love. Do not become absorbed in sorrow like this."

Shlok 8: "Single plait, the bed of ground,mediation,dirty cloth,fasting at an inappropriate time - all these 
are not useful to you."

and best ornaments, the best drinks, beds and seats, song and dance and musical instrument."

Shlok 11: "You are a gem among women. Do not be like this. Make decoration on your limbs. O one with a good 
body! Getting me how will you become unsuited for luxuries?"

Shlok 12: "This your youth born beautifully is passing away, whichever youth is quickly passing away will 
not come back again like the flow of water."

Shlok 13: "O one with auspicious appearance! The creator of form, that creator of the world, Lord Brahma 
has made you and stopped - I think thus. There is not another who is equal to your appearance."

Shlok 14: "O Seetha! Obtaining you endowed with beauty and youth, which man even if he is Lord Brahma himself 
will disregard (leave) you."

Shlok 15: "O one with face like that of moon! O one with broad hips! Your whichever limb I see, my eye is 
getting tied in that that limb."

Shlok 16: "O Seetha! Become my wife. Leave this ignorance. In all my many best women brought from here and 
there, become foremost consort. Let there be auspicious to you."

Shlok 17: "O timid one! Whatever gems that have been brought by force, all those, my this kingdom and also 
myself belong to you."

I can give to king Janaka.

Shlok 20: "Suras and Asuras defeated with broken flags by me in war many times are powerless to stand in 
an army against me."

Fearlessly order also."

Shlok 25: " By my grace with your sporting, tour relatives will also sport. O auspicious one! You see my 
wealth and my fame."

Shlok 26: "O beautiful one! What can you do with Rama clad in tatters, with lost hope of victory, with gone 
fortune. Roaming in forests, observing austerities and also sleeping on floor, I doubt if Rama is alive or not."

Shlok 27: "O Seetha, Rama indeed does not get opportunity even to see you like moonlight covered by dark 
clous with cranes at the front."

Shlok 28: "Like Keerthi got by Hiranyakasipu from Indra's hand, Rama is not suited to get you from my hands."

Shlok 29: "O one with a beautiful smile! O one with beautiful teeth!O one with beautiful eyes! O charmful 
one! O timid one! You are stealing my heart like a serpent stolen by Garuda.

Shlok 30: "You are Wearing a silk cloth in a bad condition. You are emaciated. Even though you have not decorated, 
seeing you I am not getting happiness in my wives."

Shlok 31: "O Seetha! whoever women living in gynaeceum endowed with all virtues, have sovereignty on all 
of them."

Shlok 32: "O one with black hair! My those women and apsarasas who are the best among the three worlds will 
serve you like the goddess of wealth."

Shlok 33: "O one with beautiful hips! O one with beuatiful eyebrows! Enjoy according to your comfort whatever 
gems and wealth belonging to Kubera, all those three worlds and me."

Shlok 34: "O Seetha! Rama is not equal to me by austerity, not equal by might; not equal by strength, not 
equal by wealth, by brilliance and by fame."

Shlok 35: "O playful one! I will give hordes of wealth and land. You drink. Roam freely and play. Enjoy luxuries. 
Sport according to comfort in me. Your relatives may sport together in you."

Shlok 36: "O timid one! With body decorated with gold colored, pure garlands, roam with me in forests born 
at sea shore filled with groups of flowered trees and with humble bees."

also will be destroyed. After getting you like that this Lanka filled with best things in a short while will be 
destroyed due to your one sin."

Shlok 13: "O Ravana! When there is destruction of a short sighted one being hit by his own deeds, a sinner, 
living beings will be happy."

Shlok 14: "About you who is a sinner thus being destroyed, people who have been humiliated by you being happy 
will speak thus: 'The cruel Ravana by God's grace has got this danger' ".

Shlok 15: "I am not capable to be tempted by wealth or by money. I am not separate with Raghava like the 
sun-shine with the sun."

Shlok 16: "After making as a pillow that worshipped shoulder of that lord of the world, of that Rama, how 
can I make as pillow some other one's shoulder?"

Shlok 17: "Like the education of a brahmin with a famous mind, initiated in religious vow, I am suitable 
wife to that Rama alone the lord of earth."

Shlok 18: "O Ravana! Let me meet together with Rama like a female elephant with a male elephant in a forest."

Shlok 19: "It is suited that this Rama, best among men, is made to be a friend by you who is desiring continued 
existence and not desiring a horrible slaying."

Shlok 20: "Rama the righteous one is indeed known as one who loves those who seek protection. If you desire 
to live. let there be friendship between you and Rama."

Shlok 21: "You seek graciousness of this Rama who loves those who seek protection. Becoming piously disposed, 
you are suited to return me to this Rama."

Shlok 22: "In this way giving me to Rama will become fortunate to you. O Ravana! If you do in a different 
way, you will get slayed."

Shlok 23: "Drawn out Vajrayudha, the weapon of Indra may spare some one like you. Lord of death may spare 
you for a long time. That Rama the lord of worlds greatly enraged will not spare you."

Shlok 24: "Like the great sound of Vajrayudha hurled by Indra, you will hear a loud sound which is sonorous 
of Rama's bow."

Shlok 25: "Arrows with good nodes, with blazing tips, like snakes, with characteristic signs of Rama and 
Lakshmana will fall down soon here in Lanka."

Shlok 26: "Arrows tied with the plumes of an eagle will hit ogres everywhere in this city and will cover 
the city without space."

Shlok 27: "That Garuda called Rama speedily will pluck the great serpants called ogres like Vainateya plucking 
the serpants."

Shlok 28: "My husband who is a destroyer of foes will take me away from you like Lord Vishnu with three steps 
taking away the brilliant prosperity from Asuras."

Shlok 29: "O ogre! While the army of ogres was being killed at Janasthana which became the land of dead, 
this bad deed has been done by you being powerless."

Shlok 30: "O lowest one! When those brothers were gone out, entering hermitage without them, I have been 
abducted by you."

Shlok 31: "Like tiger by dog, smelling the scent of Rama and Lakshmana it is indeed not possible by you to 
stand in their view."

Shlok 32: "To you like that, enmity with those two is like the enmity of one hand of Vruttasura with two 
hands of Indra and it is not persevering for you to be an opponent with them."

Shlok 33: "My husband that Rama together with Lakshmana will take away with His arrows your life quickly 
like the sun drying up shallow water."

Shlok 34: "Killed by time even if you go to the mountain of Kubera or to his house or if you go to the assembly 
of King Varuna, without doubt you will not be relased from Rama like a great tree from thunderbolt."

to be humilaited, interested in Rama who is in sham exile, I am not killing you."

Shlok 6: "O Seetha! Here whatever harsh words you are speaking about me, because of those words, you are

Rama like Sachi the wife of Indra."

Shlok 15: "O vile ogre! Whatever sinful word you spoke to me who is the wife of the great resplendent Rama, 
from that word where will you go to be released?"

Shlok 16: "Like an elephant in rut and a hare at war in the forest, in the same way O vile one! Rama is like 
an elephant and you are said to be like a hare."

Shlok 17: "Such you are not shameful abusing the lord of Ikshvaku dynasty Rama. You are not getting Rama's 
matter so much."

Shlok 18: "O ignoble one! your these eyes which are cruel, crooked, which are black and reddish brown, which 
are seeing me, for what reason are they not falling down."

Shlok 19: "Thus speaking about me who am the wife of virtuous Rama and the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha how 
your tongue did not fall off."

Shlok 20: "O Ravana! Although you are suited to be burnt into ashes, not having the mandate of Rama and preserving 
austerity, I am not reducing you into ashes with my glory."

Shlok 21: "Wise Rama's I am not capable of being abducted by you. This act has been made for your slaying.

its peaks.

Shlok 28: With the color of just risen sun, decorated by earrings, he was like a mountain with Ashoka trees 
with red flowers and shoots.

together do that task."

of punishment, bring Seetha under my possession."

Shlok 38: Ravana thus ordered again and again with a mind full of lust and anger frightened Seetha.

Shlok 40: "O king! Sport with me. O lord of ogres! Of what use to you is this Seetha who is colorless and 
a wreched human."

Shlok 41: "O king! Lord Barhma did not assign to Her wonderful best luxuries earned by the might of your 
arms. This is definite."

Shlok 42: "The body of one who desires a woman without desire suffers pain. Good happiness will occur to 
one who loves a woman who desires him."

Shlok 43: Thus spoken to by that ogre that Ravana who was strong equalling a cloud, thereafter being taken 
away turned back laughing."

of the three worlds and taking him as husband.

Shlok 5: "O beautiful one! O irrreproachable one! But being a human you are desiring that Rama who is a 
human, banished from kingdom, unsuccessful and gloomy."

Shlok 6: Seetha with eyes like lotuses hearing the words of ogre women spoke these words with eyes filled 
with tears.

Shlok 7: "All of you coming together whatever words which are hated in the world you spoke in my matter, 
this does it not seem sinful in your mind?"

Shlok 8: "Human woman is not waited to become wife of an ogre. All of you freely eat me. I will not honour

on the Moon God, like Lopamudra on Agastya, like Sukanya on Chyavana, like Savitri on Satyavanta, like Srimati 
on Kapila, like Madayanti on Saudasa, like Kesini on Sagara, like Damayanti the daughter of Bhima, devoted to 
husband Nala, in the same way I am devoted to my husband Rama, the best in Ikshvaku dynasty."

doing something excessively serves as vice."

Shlok 22: "O Seetha! I am happy. Human duty has been done by you. Let there be fortune to you. Do also according 
to my wholesome words being told."

Shlok 23- 24: "Obtain as husband Ravana who is the lord of al l ogres, bold and handsome, like Indra the lord 
of Devas, able one and liberal with a pleasing appearance to all."

Shlok 25: "Leaving Rama who is a human and miserable, seek refuge in Ravana. O Seetha! With best unguents 
to the body and decorated with best ornaments, become mistress of all the worlds from today."

Shlok 26: "O auspicious one! Like Svaha the wife of the Fire God, like Sachi the wife of Indra become mistress 
of all worlds. O Seetha! What is the use with Rama who is miserable and with gone vigour."

Shlok 27: If you do not do my this spoken word, all of us in this moment will eat you.

Shlok 28: Another ogre named Vikata with hanging breasts raising fist and roaring with anger spoke to Seetha.

Shlok 29: "O Seetha with an evil mind! Your many words which are unpleasant have been tolerated due to pity 
and due to softness."

Shlok 30- 31: "O Seetha! You are not doing according to our word which is respected by time and wholesome. You 
have been brought to this bank of the ocean not obtainable by others. You have entered the terrible gynaeceum 
of Ravana."

Shlok 32: "Withheld in the house of Ravana well protected by us, even Devendra himself is not capable to 
protect you."

Shlok 33: "O Seetha! Do according to my word, which is beneficial. Discharge of tears is enough. Leave worthless 
gloom."

Shlok 34: "O Seetha! Have love and happiness. Leave this daily gloom. Sport according to comfort with the 
king of ogres."

Shlok 35: "O timid one! You know how youth of women is not lasting. As long as your youth will not pass away, 
so long get comfort."

nearby forests.

plucking it out."

this word.

Shlok 40: "Seeing this woman with eyes like that of a deer, with moving breasts due to fear, abducted by

Shlok 41: "It is my mind to eat the liver, the spleen, flesh above heart and heart together with muscle and 
entrails and the head."

Shlok 42: An ogre woman named Pragasa spoke these words : "Squeeze the neck of this cruel woman. Why do we 
delay?"

Shlok 43: "Thereafter let it be known to the king that that human woman has died. He will say thus : "Eat.". 
There is no doubt in this matter."

Shlok 44: Thereafter an ogre woman named Ajamukhi spoke these words : "All of you killing this woman thereafter 
do equal pieces."



"Thereafter all of us will divide. Quarrel is not desirable to me. Liquor, many kinds and a lot 
of lickables be brought quickly."

Shlok 46: Thereafter an ogre woman named Surpanakha spoke these words: "That which was spoken by Ajamukhi, 
is desirable to me."

Shlok 47: "Liquor which is the destroyer of all sorrow be brought quickly. Eating human flesh afterwards, 
we will dance for propitiating Nikumbila."

I will not do according to your words."

into own body and shook a lot.

Shlok 6: That Seetha with a broken heart due to grief, held a wide flowering branch of Ashoka tree and thought 
about Her husband.

Shlok 7: Then that Seetha washing Her wide breasts with a flow of tears from eyes and thinking, did not 
get end of sorrow.

Shlok 8: That Seetha was shaking like a plantain tree fallen down in an exceedingly windy place, trembling 
with fear of the ogre women, and became with a pale face.

Shlok 9: That moving plait, which was wide and long, of that best woman was seen to be like a serpant in 
motion.

Shlok 10: That Seetha tormented by grief, with a mind hit by sorrow, struck by calamity was sighing and let 
down tears and also cried.

Shlok 11: Seetha being tormented by grief said : "Oh! Rama!" and again "Oh! Lakshmana!","Oh! Kausalya!, my 
mother-in-law" "Oh! Sumitra!"

Shlok 12- 13: "I thus being tormented by cruel ogre women here lacking Rama, being tormented by grief, when I 
am living even for a moment,' death at wrong time to woman or to a man is hard' - thus being said this popular 
saying in the world is true."

Shlok 14: "This me with small merit,wreched, like an orphan, will perish like a ship in the middle of the 
ocean being hit by the speed of wind."

Shlok 15: "Not seeing my husband that Rama and obtaining control of ogre women like a bank hit by water I 
am verily perishing with sorrow."

Shlok 16: "Only fortunate see that my husband with eyes like petals of an expanded lotus, walking with the 
gait of a lion, correct in conduct and a pleasant talker."

Shlok 17: "To me lacking that Rama with a famous soul, like after eating a pungent poison life in all ways 
is hard."

Shlok 18: "By what this horrible and very dreadful grief is obtained by me, what kind of great sin had been 
done by me in another life."

Shlok 19: "Together with great grief, I desire to give away my life. This desire is not obtainable by me. 
I am well protected by ogre women."

Shlok 20: "Fie upon human condition! Fie upon being in the control of others. By what reason it is not possible 
according to own desire to give up life."



SARGA 26
------------------------------

[Text] In this chapter Seetha ponders a lot and decides to give up life without Rama.

Shlok 1: With a face continually shedding tears, Seetha an young woman, thus speaking with a downward face, 
started to weep.

Shlok 2: Seetha was crying like a mad one, like an intoxicated one, with a deluded mind. Like a female horse 
rolling on ground, Seetha rolled on the ground.

Shlok 3: "While Rama was heedless (taken away by Mareecha), I who have been crying was forcibly brought 
overpowered by the ogre Ravana who can wear desired form."

Shlok 4: "Being under the control of ogresses, being frightened very horribly, thinking and being tormented 
by grief, I do not desire to live."

Shlok 5: "Without Rama, a great car-warrior, living in the midst of ogresses, there is no use with life 
to me; not with wealth, not with ornaments."

Shlok 6: "Or my this heart truly is made of iron. It is undecaying and without death. By what reason is 
it not destroying with sorrow?"

Shlok 7: "Whoever I with a sinful life made to be without Rama, protecting life even for a moment, to such 
me who am ignoble, who am bad wife, shame on me."

Shlok 8: "Without husband Rama who is the lord of the earth with ocean at the end, a pleasant talker, what 
is the interest to me in life or in comfort."

Shlok 9: "I will leave the body. Let it be split into pieces or let it be eaten. I without husband will 
not tolerate sorrow for a long time."

Shlok 10: "I will not touch even with my left foot Ravana an ogre of reprehensible conduct. What to say of 
desiring him."

Shlok 11: "Whoever Ravana with a cruel nature is desiring to solicit me, that Ravana does not know him to 
be refused; he does not know his race."

Shlok 12: "Even if cut or if divided into parts in blazing fire, I will not reach Ravana. What is the use 
with your prattling for a long time?"

Shlok 13: "Rama is famous, is a wise man, is compassionate with a good conduct. Due to the deterioration 
of my fortune, I doubt He became hard hearted."

Shlok 14: "By whom alone fourteen thousand of ogres have been destroyed, why is that Rama not saving me."

Shlok 15: "I am withheld by the ogre Ravana with little strength. My husband is indeed capable of killing 
Ravana in a war."

Shlok 16: "By which Rama Viradha, best among ogres, has been killed in Dandaka forest in a war, why is that 
He not saving me?"

Shlok 17: "This city of Lanka being in the middle of ocean is difficult to be attacked. But there will not 
be an obstacle to flying of Rama's arrows."

Shlok 18: "What now is that reason by which Rama with a firm courage is not protecting His dear wife stolen 
by an ogre."

Shlok 19: "I doubt that Rama elder to Laksmana does not know me to be here. After knowing will that glorious 
Rama tolerate this outrage?"

Shlok 20: "Whoever Jatayu nearing Rama will have let known to Rama that Seetha was stolen, that king of vultures 
has been killed by Ravana in war."

Shlok 21: "A great deed has been done by that Jatayu, thus protecting me, although of old age, standing in 
a dual combat with Ravana."

Shlok 22: "If that Rama knows me to be living here, with anger He will make the world to be without ogres 
with His arrows now."

Shlok 23: "Rama will blow away the city of Lanka, will dry up the great ocean, will destroy the name and 
fame of Ravana."

Shlok 24: "Thereafter how I am crying in this way, in the same way, in very house, ogresses with killed husbands 
will cry again and again. There is no doubt in this."

Shlok 25: "Rama together will Lakshmana will search the city of Lanka belonging to ogres. An enemy seen by 
those two will indeed not live even for a moment."

Shlok 26: "This Lanka shortly will become like a graveyard, with paths agitated with smoke of funeral pyres, 
crowded with a group of vultures."

Shlok 27: "In a short time only I will attain my desire. This evil course is telling of destruction of you 
all."

Shlok 28: "Here in Lanka whatever inauspicious things are being seen, from those, in a short while Lanka 
will become deprived of glory."

Shlok 29: "While the sinful, vile ogre Ravana is being killed, Lanka which is unconquerable till now, definitely 
will get drying up like a woman who lost husband."

Shlok 30: "Now abounding in pious festivities, the city of Lanka with lost lord together with ogresses will 
become like a woman with lost husband."

Shlok 31: "In a short while here in every house I can definitely hear the sound of ogresses crying being 
tormented by grief."

Shlok 32: "The city of Lanka will become burnt by Rama's arrows together with darkness, with destroyed luster 
with killed best ogres."

Shlok 33: "Will that Rama who is a strong man with red eye corners know me to be in the house of Ravana."

Shlok 34: "Whatever time has been ordered by this cruel and vilest of men Ravana, this time has come to me. 
That death decreed to me does not hold good to this evil one (Ravana)."

Shlok 35- 36: "Whoever sinful ogres who do not know what should not be done, due to their unrighteousness now 
there will be a great calamity. These meat eating ogres do not know virtue."

Shlok 37: "An ogre will definitely eat me for breakfast. What should such I do without Rama with pleasing 
appearance? I am grieving a lot not seeing Rama with red eye corners."

Shlok 38: "Now if there exists any one who is a giver of poison here, I without husband quickly will see 
the god Yama."

Shlok 39: "That Rama elder to Lakshmana may not know me to be alive. If those two know me to be alive, then 
it cannot be said that they will not do my search on earth."

Shlok 40: "That valiant Rama who is the elder brother of Lakshmana due to grief of me, leaving the body on 
earth has gone to celestial world. This is certain."

Shlok 41: "Whoever is seeing my husband Rama with eyes resembling a lotus flower such Devas, Siddhas together 
with Gandharvas and great sages are fortunate."

Shlok 42: "Or to that Rama with a desire in virtuousness, who is intelligent, a sage-king, the supreme spirit, 
there is no use with me, his wife."

Shlok 43: "Friendly disposition will occur in what is being seen. There is no friendship to one who does 
not see. Ungrateful ones destroy frindship. But Rama will not destroy friendship."

Shlok 44: "I who is a woman who is perishing without the chief Rama to such me are there no good qualities 
or has my fortune diminished."

Shlok 45: "To me who is deprived of Rama with untroubled reputation, a warrior, annihilator of enemies, a 
great soul, more than living, death is good."

Shlok 46: "Or those two brothers who are best among men giving up weapons in the forest may have become dwellers 
of forest eating roots and fruits."

Shlok 47: "Or Rama and Lakshmana the warrior brothers may have been killed by the evil soul king of ogres 
Ravana by deceit."

Shlok 48: "Under such circumstances and time, such I in all ways am desiring to die. Even in this grief, 
death is not bestowed on me."

Shlok 49: "Great souled ones with abandoned sins, with a conquered mind, those with great fortune, sages 
are indeed fortunate to whom there is no pleasure and displeasure."

Shlok 50: "From pleasure sorrow and from displeasure great fear do not occur to great souls. Whoever are 
separated from pleasure and displeasure, my obeisance to such great souls."

Shlok 51: "Left by dear Rama with a well known mind coming under the control of sinful Ravana, such I will 
leave breath of life."

[Text] In this chapter an ogress named Trijata describes her dream. She dreams of Sri Rama triumphs and 
the ogre Ravana is conquered.

Shlok 1: Thus spoken to by Seetha, ogresses swooned with anger terribly. Some went to tell that to Ravana 
the evil minded one.

Shlok 2: Therafter ogresses with a terrible appearance neared Seetha and ten agin spoke words of evil purpose, 
with a single meaning and which were harsh.

Shlok 3: "O ignoble one! O one with a sinful resolve! O Seetha! Today at this moment ogreeses will eat this 
your flesh according to comfort."

Shlok 4: Then, seeing Seetha frightened by those evil ones, an ogress named Trijata, sleeping till then, 
spoke these words.

Shlok 5: "O evil ones! Eat your selves. You will not eat Seetha who is the dear daughter of king Janaka 
and daughter-in-law of king Dasaratha."

Shlok 6: "Now a dream which is terrible, causing the hairs to stand erect for the destruction of ogres and 
for the welfare of Her husband, has been seen by me."

Shlok 7: Thus spoken to by Trijata all ogresses were frightened and spoke to that Trijata these words.

Shlok 8: "Of what kind is this dream seen by you. Tell us". Listening to this utterance that came forth 
from the mouths of those ogresses, Trijata spoke at that time this word relating to the dream.

Shlok 9-10: "Rama wearing white garlands and clothes passing through the sky, Himself ascending a palanquin 
made of ivory tied with a thousand swans, arrived along with Lakshmana."

Shlok 11: "Now it has been seen by me in the dream that Seetha also wearing white clothes was sitting on 
a white mountain surrounded by the ocean."

Shlok 12: "Seetha came together with Rama like the light with the Sun. Rama also was seen by me to be mounted 
on a great elephant with four tusks and equalling a mountain and Rama wandered together with Lakshmana."

Shlok 13: "Thereafter shining with their own radiance, wearing white garlands and clothes, those two best 
among men Rama and Laksmana neared Seetha."

Shlok 14: "Thereafter Seetha rested on the upper part of back of elephant in the sky; taken by Her husband 
Rama to the front of that mountain."

Shlok 15: "Thereafter it has been seen by me that Seetha with eyes like lotuses has risen up from the lap 
of Her husband and gently touched the Moon and the Sun with Her hand."

Shlok 16: "Thereafter that best elephant ascended by those princes Rama and Lakshmana and by Seetha with 
wide eyes stood on the top of Lanka."

Shlok 17: "Rama together with wife Seetha, Himself came here in a chariot tied with eight white bulls."

Shlok 18-19: "The valorous best among men Rama together with brother Lakshmana and with Seetha ascended wonderful 
Pushpaka aeroplane equalling the Sun, went in the northern direction."

Shlok 20: "Rama with strength equalling that of Lord Vishnu, born in Raghu's dynasty together with brother 
Lakshmana and with Seetha has been seen by me thus in the dream."

Shlok 21: "Rama with great glory is not possible to be defeated by Suras or by ogres or by others like heaven 
not being conquerable by sinners."

Shlok 22: "Ravana also was seen by me on earth sprinkled with oil, with red clothes, with garlands tied with 
Oleander flowers, drinking oil and intoxicated."

Shlok 23: "Now Ravana fallen down on to earth from Pushpaka aeroplane having the head shaved, wearing black 
clothes again was seen to be pulled by a woman."

Shlok 24: "Wearing red garlands and unguents, drinking oil, laughing, dancing, with a confused mind, with 
agitated senses, Ravana went by a chariot tied by donkeys."

Shlok 25: "Undertaking southern direction, Ravana went quickly by a donkey.Again it was seen by me that the 
king of ogres Ravana stupefied with fear, fell down from the donkey with head down."

Shlok 26- 27: "That Ravana rising up quickly, together with perplexity, distressed with fear, excited by passion, 
being naked, like a mad man, prattling many bad words, entering dirt with a bad smell, which was intolerable, 
horrible, dark, like the hell and quickly sank in that."

Shlok 28: "A woman with red clothes, who was black, with body smeared with dirt, tying Ravana by the throat, 
was pulling hiim in southern direction."

Shlok 29: "In that dream the ogre Kumbhakarna has been seen thus by me. All Ravana's sons have been seen 
to be sprinkled with oil."

Shlok 30: "Ravana by a pig, Indrajit by a porpoise, Kumbhakarna by a camel set out in southern direction."

Shlok 31: "Among those Vibhishana is the only one who has been seen by me to be having a white umbrella, 
wearing white garlands and clothes and anointing body with white unguents."

Shlok 32-33: "Vibhishana is there adorned with the sound of conch shells and kettledrums, with dances and songs, 
ascended a best elephant equalling a mountain with the sound of a thundering cloud, with four tusks. He approached 
the sky together with four ministers"

Shlok 34: "An assembly also of ogres drinking oil and wearing red garlands, with red clothes, with the sound 
of songs and musical instruments has been seen by me."

Shlok 35: "This beautiful city of Lanka has also been seen together with horses and elephants with broken 
gates and arches fallen down in the ocean."

Shlok 36: "Lanka protected by Ravana has been seen by me in the dream to be burnt by a quick Vanara who is 
a messenger of Rama."

Shlok 37: "In Lanka horrible with ash, all ogresses were drinking oil, laughing heartily with a great noise 
and also dancing a lot."

Shlok 38: "All these best among ogres such as Kumbhakarna and others taking a red cloth entered a hole filled 
with cow dung."

Shlok 39: "Go away! Be destroyed! Rama will get Seetha. With a great anger He will get you killed together 
with other ogres."

Shlok 40: "Rama will not approve frightening ot threatening His dear wife who is highly valued by Him, who 
followed Him to live in the forest."

Shlok 41: "For that reason, enough of cruel words. Gentle words indeed be said. Let us request Seetha. This 
is agreeable to me."

Shlok 42: "Which woman while being sorrowful, such type of dream has been seen, that woman being released 
from various sorrows, will get unsurpassed pleasure."

Shlok 43: "O ogresses! Entreat Seetha who has been frightened. What is the use with a desire to speak. From 
Rama a horrible fear has come to ogres."

Shlok 44-45: "O ogresses! This Seetha daughter of Janaka, pleased with prostration is competent to protect us 
from great danger. And also I do not see in Her who is wide eyed, in Her limbs even a minute misshapen characteristic, 
even insignificant one."

Shlok 46: "I see an imperfection in complexion alone. I doubt that this princess who came near an aeroplane 
in my dream, who is not suited to sorrows received sorrow."

Shlok 47: "I am seeing Seetha coming near accomplishment of motive. I also see the destruction of Ravana 
also and victory of Rama coming near."

Shlok 48: "Being a cause to listen to a great pleasure of Her, this throbbing eye long like a lotus petal 
is being seen my me."

Shlok 49: "One left arm of this strightforward Seetha suddenly has become erect and is slightly trembling."

Shlok 50: "Seetha's best left thigh equal to an elephant's trunk is trembling indicating Rama's standing 
in front of Her."

Shlok 51: "A bird also entering its dwelling place on a branch again and again speaking best consolating 
words, is telling heartily welcoming words being delighted again and again, as though impelling Seetha."



SARGA 28
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha recollects the time limit of two months given by Ravana and her vulnerability of being killed 
by him. After lamenting for a while, she tries to strangle herself to death with the braid of her hair. At that 
moment, a propitious omen never seen before appears on her person.

Shlok 1: That Seetha, hearing those unpleasant words of Ravana, tormented by grief, was frightened like 
a tiny female-elephant overpowered by a lion in the middle of a forest.

Shlok 2: That fearful Seetha, who was situated in the middle of female-demons and also threatened by Ravana 
with his words galore, lamented (as follows) like a young virgin who was left lonely in the midst of a forest.

Shlok 3: "Truly the saints affirm that untimely death does not come in the world, as I being impure am surviving 
even for an instant, though being threatened in this way."

Shlok 4: "Though devoid of happiness and frequently full of sorrow, my heart must be hard indeed, in that 
it does not break into a thousand pieces today like a mountain-top struck by lightning."

Shlok 5: "There is no fault of mine in this matter. I have become killable at the hands of this demon of 
disagreeable perception. I am not able to give him my affection any more than a member of the twice-born classes 
would offer a mystical verse to one not belonging to the twice-born classes."

Shlok 6: "If Rama the Ruler of the world does not come here, the evil Ravana, the king of Demons will cut 
off my limbs with his sharpened weapons, even as a surgeon would cut the limbs of a lifeless feotus."

Shlok 7: "To me lamenting, two months will go up to a long time, as at the end of a night a thief imprisoned 
and to be capitally punished under the detention orders of a king. Alas! This is painful."

Shlok 8: "O Rama, O Lakshmana, O Sumitra, O Kausalya! O mother! I, of a scanty fortune, am going to be destroyed, 
like a ship driven out of its course by a strong wind in a mighty ocean."

Shlok 9: "In the disguise of a deer, those two energetic sons of Dasaratha were surely killed for my sake, 
as two excellent lions killed by a flashing thunderbolt."

Shlok 10: "Certainly that Time-spirit, assuming the guise of a deer, allured me, a woman of poor fortune 
at that time and to whom I, a stupid woman, sent forth (far away) Lakshmana and the noble prince Rama the elder 
brother of Lakshmana."

Shlok 11: "O Rama, the strictly truthful man and the long-armed, O the man whose face resembles the full-moon! 
You, who are well-disposed of the world of living beings, do not indeed know me to have been sentenced to death 
by the demons."

Shlok 12: "My not having a deity (other than my husband), this patience, my reposing on the floor, my restriction 
in righteousness, my devotion to the husband - all this has become a waste, like a good act done by men to ungrateful 
men becoming waste".

Shlok 13: "For me who is not seeing you, who is bereft of you, who is not hopeful of coming into contact 
with you, who is emaciated and pale in complexion this righteous act performed by me has indeed become a waste. 
Likewise, this state of my being only one wife to you has become useless.."

Shlok 14: "Having fulfilled your father's command as per the order of his words and observed your vow, you 
return from the forest fearlessly and having accomplished your purpose, I think you will enjoy carnally with large-eyed 
women."

Shlok 15: "O Rama! Having performed austerity and vow in vain, I for myself who has fallen in love with you 
and in whose was confined an affection for you for a long time, for my own destruction, I can lose my life. Woe 
to me of my little fortune!"

Shlok 16: "I as such will abandon quickly my life by poison or by a sharp weapon. To me, none is there, who 
is a giver either of a poison or of a sharp weapon in the house of Ravana."

Shlok 17: Thus lamenting in several ways, Seetha was recollecting Rama in all spirits and trembling with 
and emaciated face, approached that excellent tree in bloom.

Shlok 18: Seetha, who was tormented with grief, thus thinking in various ways and thereafter holding her 
braid of hair looking like a hanging rope (now thought within herself) "I shall go to the presence of Yama the 
God of Death by tying my neck quickly with my braid of hair looking like a hanging rope"

Shlok 19- 20: Thereafter Seetha with all her soft limbs stood seizing a branch of that tree. To her having handsome 
limbs, who was thinking of Rama, Lakshmana and her own race, then appeared many omens, which were not having adequate 
occasion for grief, which procured courage in the world, which were excellent and which were seen earlier also 
as thoroughly efficacious.



SARGA 29
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha experiences some good omens as follows; Her left eye, left shoulder and left thigh quivered, 
as also her clothing slipped a bit. Feeling these omens, her consciousness was awakened with exaltation.

Shlok 1: To her who was in such circumstances, who was in distress, who was irraproachable, devoid of joy 
and dejected but virtuous, was bestowed with auspicious omens, as a prosperous man is bestowed with dependent 
servants.

Shlok 2: The beautifully haired Seetha's left eye, which was auspicious, whose surrounding row of eye-lashes 
were curved, which was black, wide and bright-looking; was predominantly quivering, like a red lotus quivered 
by the blow of a fish.

Shlok 3: Her left shoulder, which was pretty, distinguished beefy and round, which deserved to be applied 
with excellent black aloe and sandalwood paste, which had been used

Shlok 4: Of her two thighs kept together, the left tigh which was beefy and well born, which resembled the 
trunk of a princely elephant was predominantly quivering, spoke indistinctly of existenc of Rama in front.

Shlok 5: Again, the clothing of Seetha standing there, of spotless eyes and charming limbs, having teeth 
resembling the buds of jasmine, which was of golden shade and was slightly soiled as it were with dust, glited 
down, which appeared auspicious (for her).

Shlok 6: Bolstered by these and some other omens which straight explained that they were fruitful on the 
earlier occasion also, Seetha of beautiful eyebrows disclosed a great joy, even as a seed vanished and withered 
by the wind and the sun, got sprouted by rain.

Shlok 7: Moreover, having the lips resembling Bimba fruit, having beautiful eyes and eyebrows, whose eye 
lids are curved, having charming white teeth, her face shone like the moon liberated from the mouth of the demon 
Rahu.

Shlok 8: Free from sorrow, her weariness removed, her mental affliction alleviated and her consciousness 
awakened with exaltation, that esteemed lady (Seetha) looked handsome with her countenance, as a night with the 
moon appears during the bright fortnight.



SARGA 30
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma falls in a dilemma whether to console Seetha or to remain silent. Finally Hanuma decides 
to console Seetha, by eulogising Rama's attributes in a sweet voice, so that Seetha can give credence to his words.

Shlok 1: The valiant Hanuma also heard truly all those words of Seetha, Trijata and the threatening words 
of the female demons.

Shlok 2: Thereafter, seeing that Seetha as a divine lady in the garden of Nandana, Hanuma echoed his thought 
in various ways.

Shlok 3: "Which Seetha is being searched in all directions by many thousands and myriads of monkeys, the 
same Seetha has been found by me."

Shlok 4: "By me, employed thoughtfully (by my Master) as a secret agent and gone about secretly with a view 
to ascertain the enemy's strength, this has been perceived.

Shlok 5: "The characteristics of demons, this town and the power of the king of demons, Ravana, have been 
perceived by me."

Shlok 6: "It is proper for me to console the wife of Rama, desirous of seeing her husband who is compassionate 
towards all beings and who is of immeasurable might."

Shlok 7: "I shall console this woman, whose face resembles a full moon, who is having an unforeseen affliction, 
who is tormented by grief and who is not attaining the end to her affliction."

Shlok 8: "If I return without consoling this Seetha, the wife of Rama, even though her mind is tormented 
by grief, my departure becomes blemished."

Shlok 9: "Not finding a rescue when I return to Kishkindha, the illustrious princess Seetha may give up 
her life."

Shlok 10: "That long-armed Rama having the countenance of a full moon, eagerly longing to see Seetha, is 
fit to be consoled by me."

Shlok 11: "It is not proper to speak with her within the sight of these female-demons. How indeed is this 
to be done? I am indeed perplexed."

Shlok 12: "If she is not consoled by me during the rest of this night, she will forsake her life by all means. 
There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 13: "If Rama enquires of me as to what words did Seetha speak about him, what can I say to Rama without 
speaking now to this Seetha, the slender-waisted lady?"

Shlok 14: "To me returning in haste from here without carrying Seetha's message Rama may get irritated and 
burn me up with his pungent eyes."

Shlok 15: "Even if I instigate my master Sugreeva to do his best in the cause of Rama, his arrival here with 
an army will be futile."

Shlok 16: "Staying here itself and getting hold of an opportunity even in the midst of the female-demons 
(when they are in attentive), I shall slowly console Seetha who is very much in distress."

Shlok 17: "However, I am very small in stature, particularly as a monkey and can speak now Sanskrit, the 
human language too."

Shlok 18: "If I use Sanskrit language like a brahmin, Seetha will get frightened, thinking me as Ravana. 
Especially, how can a monkey speak it?"

Shlok 19: "Certainly, meaningful words of a human being are to be spoken by me. Otherwise, the virtuous Seetha 
cannot be consoled."

Shlok 20: "Looking at my figure and the language, Seetha who was already frightened previously by the demons, 
will get frightened again."

Shlok 21: "Thereafter, this large-eyed Seetha who is full of mind, thinking me as Ravana who can assume any 
form at will, may shout loudly, engendered by fear."

Shlok 22: "As soon as Seetha shouts loudly, a troop of female-demons, wielding various kinds of weapons and 
appearing dreadful as Yama the Lord of Death, may assemble here."

Shlok 23: "Then those ugly faced female-demons may encircle me from all sides and try to catch and kill me 
with all their might."

Shlok 24: "Then, seeing me running hither and thither, seizing big branches, twigs and trunks of excellent 
trees, they may get alarmed with fear."

Shlok 25: "The ugly faced female-demons will be frightened with fear, after seeing my huge figure wandering 
in the grove."

Shlok 26: "Then those female-demons may call the other demons too retained by Ravana in his house."

Shlok 27: "Those female-demons with an element of turbulence and rapidity may rush into a battle with various 
kinds of weapons like spears lances and swords."

Shlok 28: "Surrounded on all sides by them, I may not be able to reach the other shore of the great ocean, 
while destroying the army of demons."

Shlok 29: "Or having jumped up (over me) many demons operating speedily may capture me. Then, Seetha may 
not be able to know the occurrence of my arrival. Even I may get captured too."

Shlok 30: "Or the violent minded demons may kill this Seetha. Consequently this work of Rama and Sugreeva 
will be ruined."

Shlok 31: "Seetha is residing in this secret place, with a concealed access, surrounded by demons and encircled 
by an ocean."

Shlok 32: "If I am killed in the battle or got captured by the demons, I do not see any other companion for 
Rama who can fulfill this work (of searching for Seetha)."

Shlok 33: "Even after due reflection, I do not see any monkey who can transgress the ocean with a breadth 
of one hundred Yojanas, in case I am killed."

Shlok 33: "I am competent to kill even thousands of demons. I am quite sure. But, after doing such a large 
battle, I may not be capable of reaching the other shore of the ocean."

Shlok 35: 'Conflicts are unreal too and to me, there is no desire for uncertainty. which intellectual will 
do an assured act with an apprehension?"

Shlok 36: "If I do not talk, there will be Seetha's death. If I talk to Seetha, this great lapse will occur."

Shlok 37: "Actions which are going to be accomplished shortly, get spoiled at the hands of a accomplished 
shortly, get spoiled at the hands of a confused messenger, when the actions are set in opposition to time and 
space, even as darkness disappears at sun rise."

Shlok 38: "Even if a decision is taken, regarding what is worthy and what is worthless, it does not yield 
good results. Messengers boasting themselves to be learned, thus indeed ruin those actions."

Shlok 39: "How does not my work get spoiled? How should I avoid my feebleness? Also how does not my leaping 
across the sea become vain?"

Shlok 40: "How can Seetha hear my words without fear?" Thinking in this way, the wise Hanuma made up his 
mind (as follows):

Shlok 41: "If I eulogize Rama, who is unwearied in action and a good relation, I shall not frighten her, 
whose mind is directed towards that relation."

Shlok 42- 43: "Offering auspicious and righteous words about Rama the most excellent prince Ikshvaku dynasty 
who possesses a learned soul and myself speaking in a sweet voice, I shall make everything intelligible so that 
Seetha rightly believes everything."

Shlok 44: The noble-minded Hanuman, abiding in the midst of the twigs of the trees and seeing Seetha, spoke 
the following words of many kinds which were not futile.



SARGA 31
------------------------------

[Text] Sitting on the branch of a Simshapa tree, Hanuma began to narrate in human language the story of 
Rama from the time he was born till his sending Hanuma to Lanka in search of Seetha. Hearing the narration of 
Hanuman, Seetha was overjoyed and finds Hanuma perched on Simshapa tree.

Shlok 1: Thus reflecting on many kinds of thought, Hanuma spoke the following sweet words within the hearing 
range of Seetha.

Shlok 2: "There was a king named Dasaratha who was very glorious among the kings of Ikshvaku dynasty and 
had a virtuous disposition. He owned chariots, elephants and horses, becoming very famous.

Shlok 3: "He was excellent in virtues among royal sages. He was equal to the seven sages in austerity. He 
was born in the lineage of emperors and was equivalent to Indra in prowess."

Shlok 4: "He was keen on harmlessness. He was not vulgar. He was compassionate. He was truly mighty. He 
was an eminent king in Ikshvaku race. He was endowed with prosperity and was causing to increase prosperity."

Shlok 5: "The king Dasaratha was endowed with royal characteristics, highly prosperous, excellent among 
kings and highly prosperous, excellent among kings and famous on earth with its four borders. He was happy man 
and gave happiness to others."

Shlok 6: "There was an eldest son named Rama to that Dasaratha. Rama was beloved having a moon-like face. 
He, knows the distinctions among humans and others. He was excellent among all the wielders of the bow."

Shlok 7: "That Rama who annihilates enemies, is a protector of his own mode of life, a protector of his 
own people, a protector of every living being and a protector of righteousness."

Shlok 8: "By the command of that Dasaratha, his old father and true-speaking man, that Rama a brave man 
went on exile to a forest along with his wife and brother."

Shlok 9: "While hunting in that forest, that Rama killed many demons who were valiant and who could assume 
any form at will."

Shlok 10: "Thereafter, hearing about the killing of demons in Janasthana, a part of Dandaka forest, in addition 
to killing of Khara and Dushana the demons, the enraged Ravana took away, Seetha, by deceiving Rama in creating 
an illusive image of deer in the forest."

Shlok 11: "Searching for Seetha the irreproachable lady, that Rama met a monkey called Sugreeva as his friend 
in the forest."

Shlok 12: "Thereafter, Rama the conqueror of enemy's cities and very strong man, killed Vali and gave away 
that kingdom of monkeys to Sugreeva."

Shlok 13: "As commanded and sent by Sugreeva, thousands of monkeys capable of assuming form at their will, 
are searching for that lady Seetha in all quarters of the earth."

Shlok 14: "By the words of Sampati, I a swift monkey crossed the ocean having a length of one hundred yojanas 
for the sake of this broad eyed Seetha."

Shlok 15: "This Seetha has been found by me according to the same comeliness, complexion and the bodily marks 
as I had heard from Rama."

Shlok 16: Having spoken these words, Hanuma kept quiet. Hearing those words, Seetha too got a great surprise.

Shlok 17: Thereafter, that Seetha whose consciousness was enshrouded by affliction, whose hair-ends were 
curved and who was of a fearful nature, lifted her face and looked towards Shimshupa tree.

Shlok 18: Hearing Hanuma's words and looking at all quarters and sub-quarters, Seetha was recollecting Rama 
in all ways and obtained a great joy.

Shlok 19: Looking at sides, up and down, that Seetha saw that Hanuman, the sun of wind-god, having an unimaginable 
intelligence, the minister of Sugreeva and looking like the sun behind an eastern mountain.



SARGA 32
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha is shocked to see Hanuma, perched on the branches of a shimshupa tree She is confused whether 
it is a dream or a reality. Finally, she thinks that as the monkey is talking to her in a manifested form, it 
is quite a reality. She prays Lord Brihaspati and Brahma to make he words spoken by Hanuma as true.

Shlok 1: Then, seeing Hanuma, who was tawny coloured like a series of flashing thunderbolts wrapped up in 
a white cloth and hiding behind the branches of a tree, Seetha had her mind shaken.

Shlok 2: Seetha beheld there a monkey, beaming like a cluster of Ashoka flowers wide opened, with his eyes 
resembling regined gold, humble and speaking agreeable words.

Shlok 3: Seetha got a great surprise and thought (as follows): "Alas! This monkey is hard to be approached, 
fearful and difficult to be looked at." Thus thinking, she was bewildered again.

Shlok 4- 5: The splendid woman Seetha, bewildered by fear and afflicted with grief, lamented most piteously 
saying "O, Rama! O, Rama! and "O Lakshmana!". Seetha wept faintly in a low voice in many ways.

Shlok 6: Seeing that excellent monkey appraching humbly, that splendid woman Seetha thought it as a dream.

Shlok 7: Seetha, looking hither and thither, saw Hanuman, who was having a wide and curved mouth, doing 
acts as told by sugreeva the king of monkeys, the foremost of monkeys, greatly adored and the best among the inelligent.

Shlok 8: As soon as seeing Hanuma Seetha lost her consciousness very much and became seemingly lifeless. 
Regaining her consciousness after a long time the wide eyed Seetha moreover thought (as follows)

Shlok 9: "Today, I saw an ugly monkey in my dream, which is forbidden according to a body of scriptures. 
May it be well with Rama together with Lakshmana and with my father, King Janaka.

Shlok 10: "This is not a dream. To me, tormented by sorrow and grief, there is indeed no sleep. To me, separated 
from Rama whose countenance resembles a full moon, there is no happiness indeed!"

Shlok 11: "Since I am pondering with my mind about that Rama only, and always saying 'Rama! Rama!' thus, 
confomably I am seeing and hearing a story thus corresponding to he same thought."

Shlok 12: "Tormented as I am today by manmatha god of love longing for Rama, my whole feelings directed towards 
him and constantly thinking of him alone, in the like manner I am seeing him and in the like manner i am hearing 
of him alone."

Shlok 13: "I am imagining that my wish will be fulfilled. Likewise, I am reasoning my wish by my intellect 
also. There is no concrete form indeed for my wish. He, with a well manifested form is speaking to me. for what 
reason?"

Shlok 14: "My salutation to Brihaspati the Lord of eloquence, together with Indra the wielder of a thunderbolt, 
to Brahma the self-existent Lord and to the Lord of Fire eating the oblations! Let whatever words spoken by this 
monkey be true! Let them not be untrue!"



SARGA 33
------------------------------

[Text] Stepping down from the tree, Hanuma approached Seetha and asked her to clarify him whether she 
is the wife of Rama. Seetha then starts to narrate her antecedents and the story of Rama along with circumstances 
under which she along with Rama and Lakshmana went to Dandaka forest as per the command of King Dasaratha. She 
also informs Hanuma about her snatching away of Ravana from the forest.

Shlok 1- 2: That Hanuma, with coral-coloured face, very bright, the son of wind-god, wearing a humble and feeble 
look, approached Seetha by stepping down from the tree and offered her his salutation by keeping his joined palms 
on his head and spoke the following sweet words:

Shlok 3: "O Lady with your eyes resembling lotus leaves, wearing a worn out silken cloth! O, the irreproachable 
one! You have stood, holding by the hand a branch of the tree who are you?"

Shlok 4: "Tears of sorrow are gushing down from your eyes, as water is scattered down from two lotus-petals. 
Why?"

Shlok 5: "O auspicious lady! In whom are you born-whether in celestials or in ogres or in serpent-demons 
or in celestial musicians or in demons or in semi-divine beings or in mythical beings?"

Shlok 6: "O lovely-faced woman! Who are you among eleven Rudras who bestow strength, or among Maruts the 
storm-gods or among eight Vasus the beneficent gods? O Handsome lady with fine hips! You appear to me as a deity."

Shlok 7: "Are you Rohini, endowed with all the best qualities, fallen from heaven, left behind by moon and 
excellent among stars."

Shlok 8: "O dark-eyed lady! Are you not the auspicious Arundhati, who irritated her husband, Vasishta the 
sage either by anger or by error?"

Shlok 9: "O the slender waisted lady! You seem to be lamenting over someone who died is he your son, or 
father or brother or husband."

Shlok 10: "You are lamenting. You are sighing a lot. You are touching the earth. You have royal insignia 
in you. According to these things, I do not consider you as a divine woman."

Shlok 11: "Based on the marks on your person and your bodily characteristics, I believe you to be a queen 
of an emperor and the daughter of a king."

Shlok 12: "If you are Seetha stolen per force by Ravana from Janasthana, tell it to me who is asking if you 
please!"

Shlok 13: "According to your miserable state, the super-human beautiful figure and your costume endowed with 
austerity, surely you are Rama's wife."

Shlok 14: Hearing his words, Seetha was delighted of Rama's mention and spoke the following words to Hanuma, 
who was dwelling on a tree.

Shlok 15: "I am the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, eminent among the excellent kings on earth, who understands 
the nature of the spirit and who torments the army of the adversary."

Shlok 16: "I am the daughter of the noble-natured Janaka, the king of Videha kingdom. I am know.

Shlok 17: "I stayed in Rama's house there for twelve years, enjoying the worldly pleasures belonging to human 
kind and fulfilling all my desires."

Shlok 18: "Thereafter, in the thirteenth year, King Dasaratha along with his preceptors started to perform 
anointment of the kingdom to Rama, a celebrity of Ikshvaku dynasty."

Shlok 19: "While that anointment of Rama was being arranged, a queen called Kaikeyi spoke the following words 
to Dasaratha, her husband.

Shlok 20: "If Rama gets anointed for the kingdom, from now onwards, I shall neither drink water nor take 
my food daily. This is the end to my life."

Shlok 21: "O the excellent king! If that word of pledge was uttered affectionately by you and if it is not 
going to be a waste, let Rama go to the forest."

Shlok 22: "Hearing the cruel and the disagreeable words of Kaikeyi and recollecting the boon given to the 
queen, King Dasaratha who was true to his word, fell unconscious.

Shlok 23: "Then, the aged king, who was firmly established in truth and righteousness, regretfully asked 
his illustrious eldest son to give back the kingdom, which he bestowed him earlier."

Shlok 24: "That glorious Rama first admitted his father's words in mind, considering them more dearer than 
his anointment to the kingdom and accepted them with his word."

Shlok 25: "The truly courageous Rama always gives anything to others and does not take anything from others. 
He does not speak just a little of a disagreeable word even for the cause of his life."

Shlok 26: "Leaving behind his greatly valuable outer garments and wearing garments made of bark, that highly 
illustrious Rama gave up his kingdom willingly and assigned me to his mother."

Shlok 27: "To me bereft of him, residing even in heaven does not indeed give pleasure. I, as such, decided 
to proceed to the forest and soon was ready to start even ahead of Rama."

Shlok 28: "Adorned with clothes of bark, the illustrious Lakshmana, the rejoice of his friends, got ready 
to follow his elder brother even before (me)."

Shlok 29: "Obeying respectfully the command of Lord Dasaratha, we as such with a firm resolution, entered 
the forest, which we have never seen before and which was deep and profound in appearance."

Shlok 30: While Rama of great vigour was dwelling in the forest of Dandaka, the evil-minded demon, Ravana 
took me, Rama's wife, away."

Shlok 31: "A period of two months of survival-benefit has been given to me by him. For that reason, after 
the said two months, I shall give up my life."

[Text] Hearing the words of the grief-stricken Seetha, Hanuma reveals himself to be a messenger of Rama 
and repeats the enquiries made by Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva. Seetha, however, suspects Hanuma to be Ravana 
in disguise and chides him when Hanuma approaches nearer to her. Seetha then asks Hanuma to describe the good 
qualities of Rama. Hanuma on his part discloses to her his actuality as a minister of Sugreeva and tells the important 
qualities of Rama. He requests her to have faith in his words.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words of Seetha who was overthrown from one grief to another, Hanuma the best of 
monkeys gave the following reply in a kindly and affectionate manner.

Shlok 2: "O Seetha the daughter of the king of Videha Kingdom! I have come here as your messenger on Rama's 
directions. The virtuous Rama enquired about your welfare too."

Shlok 3: "O Divine Lady! Rama the son of Dasaratha, who is excellent among the knowers of Veda and who knows 
Brahma's missile (a mythical weapon which deals infallible destruction) and Vedas the sacred knowledge, enquired 
about your welfare."

Shlok 4: "Also the greatly splendourous Lakshmana, the favourite brother and the follower of your husband, 
himself tormented with grief, performed salutation to you by bowing his head."

Shlok 5: Hearing that news of welfare of Rama and Lakshmana the excellent of men, the divine lady, with 
all her limbs thrilled with joy, spoke to Hanuma (as follows):

Shlok 6: " 'Joy rushes to surviving man even though (it be) as the end of a hundred years' - this popular 
adage appears true and and auspicious for me."

Shlok 7: Seetha showed wonderful friendly disposition towards Hanuma who approached her. Both of them also 
conversed with each other in full confidence.

Shlok 8: Hearing that reply of Seetha who was afflicted with grief, Hanuma the army-chief of monkeys endeavoured 
to draw nearer to her.

Shlok 9: In as much as that Hanuma drew nearer to her, in the same way, that Seetha suspected him as Ravana.

Shlok 10: "O shame! It was my guilt to tell him all this to him. He is indeed that Ravana, who obtained another 
guise."

Shlok 11: That Seetha, having faultless limbs, leaving that branch of Ashoka tree and as emaciated with grief, 
sat down on that ground itself.

Shlok 12: Seeing Seetha afflicted with grief and deluded with fear, the great armed Hanuma also then simply 
saluted her. She too, trembling with fear, did not look towards him again.

Shlok 13: Seetha, with her countenance resembling the moon, seeing Hanuma saluting her, had a deep sigh and 
spoke to Hanuma in a sweet-sounding voice (as follows)

Shlok 14: "If you are Ravana, who made use of an illusive guise and yourself a conjurer, you are causing 
me a further agony. It is no good."

Shlok 15: 'You are indeed the same Ravana, who, abandoning your real form, appeared to me in the guise of 
a vagrant religious mendicant in Janasthana."

Shlok 16: "O demon who can assume any form at your will! It is no good that again you are causing agony to 
me, emaciated because of fasting and feeling very miserable."

Shlok 17: "Otherwise, whatever is suspected by me is not indeed true because in my mind, a pleasurable sensation 
indeed occurred by reason of your audience."

Shlok 18: "If you have come as Rama's messenger, may you be blessed! O the best of monkeys! Rama's anecdote 
is very pleasurable for me. Hence, I am requesting you to narrate it."

Shlok 19: "O monkey! Narrate the qualities of my beloved Rama. O gentle one! You are eroding my mind as a 
rapid course of stream erodes a river bank."

Shlok 20: "I, who was taken away long ago, is seeing a monkey sent by Rama in this way. Alas! How delightful 
this dream is!'

Shlok 21: "If I have seen the eminent Rama together with Lakshmana, I would not have disheartened. In my 
case, even my dream is wicked!"

Shlok 22: "I do not deem it as a dream. Seeing a monkey in a dream does not bring about prosperity But prosperity 
has come to me!"

Shlok 23: "How possibly is it a delusion of my mind? Is it an impending course of flatulence or changing 
mental condition of madness? Is it a looming mirage?"

Shlok 24: "Otherwise, it is neither madness nor even a delusion, which is a symptom of madness. Because I 
am knowing about myself as also about this monkey."

Shlok 25: Thus deliberating upon the strengths and weaknesses in several ways, Seetha finally imagined him 
to be Ravana, as demons can change their forms at will.

Shlok 26: Then, that slender waisted Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, thus having made up her mind, did not 
reply in return anything further to Hanuman.

Shlok 27: Understanding the contemplation of Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god then brought about a great 
joy in her with his words most favourable to her ears (as follows):

Shlok 28- 29: "Rama has a great splendour like that of the sun. He is pleasing to all like the moon. As Kubera 
the Lord of wealth, he is a lord to the entire world. Like Vishnu, he is greatly renowned and endowed with valour."

Shlok 30: "Rama is a speaker of truth. Like Lord Brihaspati, he has a sweet voice. He is a handsome man, 
possessing good fortune and a royal dignity. He is a personified Manmadha, the lord of love."

Shlok 31: "Rama gets anger only at right time. He strikes a befitting person at a right time. He is an excellent 
chariot-warrior. The world is resting under the shelter of arms of this high souled man."

Shlok 32: "Showing an illusory antelope, Ravana detracted Rama and took you away from a deserted hermitage. 
You will see later, the consequence Ravana will get for this act."

Shlok 33- 34: "Which valiant Rama with arrows strongly shining like sparkles released with anger, by the same 
Rama I was sent here as a messenger and I arrived at your presence. That Rama, agonised by your separation wishes 
to enquire of your welfare."

Shlok 35: "That long-armed Lakshmana too, having a great splendour and who augments the happiness of Sumitra 
his mother, saluted you and enquired about your welfare."

Shlok 36: "O princess! That monkey called Sugreeva, a companion of Rama and the king of the excellent monkeys, 
asked about your welfare."

Shlok 37: "Rama, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, is always recollecting you. O Seetha! Eventhough coming 
into the control female-demons, you are somehow surviving by your good luck!"

Shlok 38: "Within a few days, you will see Rama, the mighty Lakshmana and the highly splendorous Sugreeva, 
in the presence of crores of monkeys."

Shlok 39: "I am a monkey, the minister of Sugreeva, called Hanuma. I entered the city of Lanka, by traversing 
the great ocean."

Shlok 40: "Asserting my strength and putting down my feet on the head of the evil minded Ravana, I have come 
to see you."

Shlok 41: "O Princess! I am not so, as you comprehend me (as Ravana). Let your suspicion be given up. Believe 
me as I say it."

[Text] Seetha asks Hanuma to describe the various characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana. Hanuma describes 
n detail to Seetha the appearance and qualities of Rama and Lakshmana. Hanuma also gives an account of how a friendship 
developed between Rama and Lakshmana as well as Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys. Hanuma also narrates his own life-story 
from the time he was born till his role as a minister of Sugreeva. He ends the story with his sight of Seetha 
in Lanka.

Shlok 1: Hearing that narration about Rama from Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, Seetha in a sweet voice 
spoke the following gentle words:

Shlok 2: "Where was your contact with Rama? How do you know Lakshmana? How did the union between monkeys 
and men arise?"

Shlok 3: "O Hanuma! What are the characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana? Narrate them to me, so that sorrow 
will not take possession of me again."

Shlok 4: "Of what kind was the appearance of that Rama and of Lakshmana? Of what kind was their form? How 
were the thighs? How were the arms? Tell me."

Shlok 5: Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma, the son of wind-god, then started to describe Rama according 
to his actual state (as follows):

Shlok 6: "O Seetha having eyes resembling lotus leaves! By my fortune, you are enquiring about the appearance 
of Rama your husband and Lakshmana, eventhough you know about them. Alas! what a pleasure!"

Shlok 7: "O the large eyed Seetha! I tell the characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana as I recognized them; 
hear them from me."

Shlok 8: "O Seetha the daughter of Janaka! Rama has his eyes resembling the petals of a lotus. He has a 
handsomeness, attracting the hearts of all living beings. He is endowed with grace and dexterity, by birth."

Shlok 9: "He is equal to the sun in splendour, earth in endurance, Brihaspati in intelligence and Indra 
in fame."

Shlok 10: "Rama the tormentator of his adversaries, is a protector of the world of beings, further protecting 
his own people. He is the protector of his own behaviour and righteousness.

Shlok 11: "O Seetha! Rama is the protector of the four castes of the world. He is the doer and also the agent 
for the people's propriety of conduct."

[Commentary] * Four principal castes described in Manu's code - Brahmanas (priestly class), Kshatriyas (members 
of military or reigning order); Vaisyas (Traders and agriculturists) and Sudras (class of servitude).

Shlok 12: "Rama is a resplendent man. He is respected exceedingly. He is established in a vow of chastity. 
He knows how to do good to virtuous people. He knows the application and advantage of his actions."

the metre 3) Vyakarana, the grammar 4) Nirukta, the explanation of difficult Vedic words 5) Jyotisha, the astronomy 
or rather the Vedic Calendar. 6) Kalpa, the ceremonial represented by a large number of Sura works.

Shlok 15: "O princess! Rama is a broad shouldered and a long-armed man. He has a shell-like neck. He has 
a handsome countenance. He has a hidden collar-bone. He has beautiful red eyes. His fame is heard about by people."

Shlok 16: "He has a voice like the sound of a kettle-drum. He has a shining skin. He is full of splendour. 
He is square-built. His limbs are built symmetrically. He is endowed with a dark-brown complexion."

Shlok 17: "He is ever firm in three limbs (viz. the breast, waist and fist), long in three (viz. the breast, 
waist and fist), long in three (viz. the eyebrows, arms and soles), uniform in three (viz. his locks, testical 
and knees, elevated in three (viz. his breast, rim of his navel and lower abdomen), coppery in three of the navel 
and the lower abdomen), coppery in three (viz. the rims of his eyes, nails, palms and soles), soft in three (viz. 
the lines on his soles, hair and the end of the membrane virile) and always deep in three (viz. the voice, gait 
and the navel)."

Shlok 18: "He has three folds in the skin of his neck and belly. He is depressed at three places (viz. the 
middle of his soles, the lines on his soles and the nipples). He is undersized at four places (viz. the neck, 
membran virile, the back and the shanks). He is endowed with three spirals in the hair of his head. He has four

elbows, wrists, knees testicles, lions, hands, feet and thighs) equally matched. The four large teeth at both 
the ends of his upper and lower jaws are very sharp. He walks in four gaits (resembling the walks of a lion, a 
tiger, an elephant and a bull). He is endowed with excellent lips, chin and nose. He has five glossy limbs (viz. 
the hair, eyes, teeth, skin and soles). He has eight long limbs (viz. the arms, fingers and toes, eyes and ears,

the membrum virile, acumen and perception). He pursues religious merit, worldly riches and the sensuous delight 
in three periods (viz. the forenoon, midday and afternoon).

Shlok 21: "Rama is engrossed in truth and righteousness. He is a prosperous man. He is interested in reception 
and facilitation. He knows how to apportion place and time. He speaks affectionately with all."

Shlok 22: "The invincible Lakshmana, the son of Rama's step-mother and Rama's brother, is resembling Rama 
in appearance, affection and in qualities."

Shlok 23: "Rama and Lakshmana, the two tigers among men, very anxiously desirous of seeing you and searching 
all over the earth, came in contact with us."

Shlok 24- 25: "Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, wandering only in search of you all over the earth, saw 
Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys, sitting on the top of Rishyamuka mountain, filled with several trees, having been 
dethroned by his elder brother, oppressed with fear, but who was pleasant to the sight."

Shlok 26: "We for one are serving that Sugreeva, the Lord of monkeys, who was true to his promise, but was 
dethroned from the kingdom from his elder brother."

Shlok 27: "In the meanwhile, those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, wearing clothes made of bark and arming 
the best bows, came to the charming place of Rishyamuka mountain."

Shlok 28: "Seeing Rama and Lakshmana, the excellent of men, coming with bows in hand, that Sugreeva the best 
of monkeys was deluded with fear and jumped over to the hill-top of that mountain."

Shlok 29: "Thereafter, stationed on that hill-top, that Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, very soon sent me only, 
to approach those two brothers."

Shlok 30: "On that command of Sugreeva, I reached saluting those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana the excellent 
and capable men, endowed with good form and characteristics."

Shlok 31: "Those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, the excellent among men, were fully endowed with kindness, 
after knowing the exact position about Sugreeva. Then, I made Rama and Lakshmana to ascend on my back and took 
them to Sugreeva's place."

Shlok 32: "I informed the high-souled Sugreeva about the true position of Rama and Lakshmana. After a mutual 
conversation between those two brothers and Sugreeva, a great friendship developed among them."

Shlok 33: "Thus endowed with friendship, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys and Rama the best of men, by talking 
together of their earlier occurrences, developed mutual confidence."

Shlok 34: "Thereafter, that Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana, through the extremely effulgent Vali the 
brother of Sugreeva, consoled Sugreeva who was earlier expelled from the kingdom; (by Vali), for the sake of Ruma 
a woman."

Shlok 35: "Then, Lakshmana informed Sugreeva the king of monkeys about the sadness of Rama, (who is unwearied 
in action), born out of your disappearance."

Shlok 36: "Hearing the words of Lakshmana, Sugreeva then became highly dim-witted, as the sun becomes dim 
when overpowered by an eclipse."

Shlok 37- 38: "Thereafter, all those multitude of ornaments which adorned your body, which were being tried to 
be be snatched away by Ravana and which were dropped on to the earth, were brought by monkey-leaders joyfully 
and shown to Rama. But the monkey-leaders did not know the further course of your movement."

Shlok 39: "I indeed brought those ornaments near to Rama and gave them to him. Then, soon after receiving 
them, Rama lost his consciousness and the resounding ornaments were scattered all over."

Shlok 40: "That Lord Rama looking like god, kept those beautiful ornaments of yours in his flank and lamented 
in many ways."

Shlok 41: "While seeing those ornaments, Rama was lamenting and getting suffocated again and again. Thus, 
those ornaments ignited the fire of Rama's grief."

Shlok 42: "That grief-stricken mighty man was thus lying on the floor for a long time. Then, with great difficulty, 
I made him to get up by telling several consoling words."

Shlok 43: "That long-armed Rama, along with Lakshmana, after seeing those ornaments, examined them, again 
and again. He later gave them to Sugreeva."

Shlok 44: "O the kind mistress! As you were being unseen, Rama was tormented forever with a great flaming 
fire of grief, like a volcano."

Shlok 45: "For your sake, insomnia, grief and worry were tormenting that great souled Rama, as flames torment 
a burning house."

Shlok 46: "By the grief caused by your not being seen, Rama is trembled with grief, as a high mountain is 
trembled by a great earthquake."

Shlok 47: "O princess! In not seeing you, Rama is not obtaining delight, even while moving in quite charming 
forests, encompassing rivers and water-falls."

Shlok 48: "O Seetha the daughter of Janaka! That Rama the excellent of men will receive you, soon after, 
killing Ravana along with Ravana's friends and relatives."

Shlok 49: "That day when Rama and Sugreeva were together, both of them made an agreement that Rama would 
annihilate Vali and Sugreeva would arrange for a search of you."

Shlok 50: "Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the two valiant princes reached Kishkindha. Rama killed Vali the 
king of monkeys there in a combat."

Shlok 51: "After killing Vali in combat by means of his strength, Rama made Sugreeva the king for the entire 
multitude of bears and monkeys."

Shlok 52: "O princess! A friendship was held well in such a manner between Rama and Sugreeva. Know me as 
Hanuma, who came here as a messenger on behalf of both of them."

Shlok 53: "Having got his own kingdom, Sugreeva summoned for mighty as well as capable monkeys and sent them 
to ten different directions in search of you."

Shlok 54: "As commanded by Sugreeva of a great splendour and the king of monkeys, those monkeys resembling 
Himalayan mountains, started out on all directions of the earth."

Shlok 55: "Then, we along with other monkeys too who are eager to fulfill the command of Sugreeva, are wandering 
the entire earth in search of you."

Shlok 56: "An excellent monkey named Angada, possessed of fortune, son of Vali and having great strength, 
taking one third of army along with him, set out in search of you."

Shlok 57: "A number of days and nights passed, filled as we were with grief, having got lost our way intensely 
in a mountain-range called Vindhya."

Shlok 58: "We were determined to forsake our lives because of despair in our non-fulfillment of work, in 
our overstepping of time-limit given by Sugreeva and in fear of the King Sugreeva."

Shlok 59: "Having searched in places difficult of access in forests, at mountains and at cascades and not 
obtaining any indication of you the princess, we were ready to give up our lives."

Shlok 60- 61: "O Seetha! Seeing all the excellent monkeys sitting down and calmly awaiting for the approach of 
death, Angada was very much immerssed in the ocean of sorrow and lamented about your loss, the killing of Vali, 
the death of Jatayu and our practice of calmly awaiting for the approach of death in simply sitting down."

Shlok 62: "For us who lost all our hopes on our lives and willing to give up our lives as per the command 
of Sugreeva, as though for the sake of our need alone, a great valiant bird came there."

Shlok 63: "Hearing about the killing of his brother, the vulture-king Sampati the brother of slain Jatayu 
the King of vultures spoke (the following) words in anger:

Shlok 64: "O the best of monkeys! Tell me who, where and how my younger brother Jabali was killed and made 
to fall."

Shlok 65: "Then, Angada told Sampati a detailed account of events which led tot he killing of that great 
bird at Janasthana, by a demon of terrific form, for your sake."

Shlok 66: "O Seetha with an excellent waist! Hearing about the slaughter of Jatayu, that Sampati the son 
of Aruna was very much pained and said that you were staying in Ravana's house."

Shlok 67: "Hearing those delightful words of Sampati, we with our Chief Angada started soon from there."

Shlok 68: "The monkeys were very much delighted and satisfied. They were making up their energy to see you, 
rose up from Vindhya mountain and reached the northern shore of the ocean."

Shlok 69: "All the monkeys with their Chief Angada, in their anxiety to see you, reached the ocean. They 
were frightened after seeing the ocean there and they were again worried."

Shlok 70: "Thereafter, seeing the ocean, I removed the serious fears of the army of monkeys who were worrying 
and crossed hundred Yojanas across the sea."

Shlok 71: "Entering even Lanka, filled with demons in the night, I saw Ravana and you too who were immersed 
in grief."

Shlok 72: "O the faultless princess! I told you all this as actually occurred. I am the messenger of Rama. 
Talk to me."

Shlok 73: "O princess! I made an effort on Rama's behalf and came here for your sake. I am Sugreeva's minister. 
I am the son of wind-god. Know me, as such."

Shlok 74: "You Rama, the excellent man among all the wielders of bow, is safe. Lakshmana, who is engaged 
in the service of his elder brother and possessing good characteristics, is also safe."

Shlok 75: "O princess! I, who am interested in the welfare of the valiant Rama, your husband, came here alone 
on the command of Sugreeva."

Shlok 76: "I, who can change my form at will, desirous of finding out your access, wandering alone without 
any helper, came to this southern direction."

Shlok 77: "I shall remove the anguish of the army of monkeys who are lamenting because of your disappearance 
by informing them about my coming close to you because of my good fortune!"

Shlok 78: "O princess! By my fortune, my crossing of ocean has not gone in vain. I can get this fame of having 
seen you because of my good luck."

Shlok 79: "The highly valiant Rama, by killing Ravana the Lord of demons along with his friends and relatives, 
will obtain you soon."

Shlok 80: "O Seetha! There is a mountain called Malyavan, which is the best among mountains. From there, 
a monkeys called Kesari went to another mountain called Gokarna."

Shlok 81: "As prayed by gods and seers, that great monkey called Kesari, my father killed a demon named Shambasadana 
at a sacred shrine near the sea-shore."

Shlok 82: "O Seetha! I am born in the womb of the wife of that Kesari the monkey, by the grace of the wind-god. 
By my activity alone, I am renowned as Hanuma in this world."

Shlok 83: "O Seetha! I described the qualities of Rama, your husband, to cause trust in you. O the faultless 
princess! Rama will take you from here within a short time."

Shlok 84: Thus inspired by confidence because of the above reasons, Seetha emaciated with grief, by adequate 
clues served as proof.

Shlok 85: Seetha obtained unequal delight. She released tears of joy from her eyes having curved eye-lashes, 
with a thrill of delight.

Shlok 86: The countenance of that large-eyed Seetha, who is beautiful, whose eyes are red white and long 
is shining like a moon, the king of stars liberated from Rahu the demon.

Shlok 87: Seetha considered Hanuma clearly as a monkey and not otherwise. Thereafter Hanuma replied to her 
who is pleasant to the sight (as follows)

Shlok 88: "O Seetha! I told you indeed all this please be consoled. Tell me what I can do for you and also 
what is agreeable to you. I am going back now."

Shlok 89: "O Seetha! As provoked by the sages, Kesari, the valiant monkey killed a demon called Shambasadana 
in battle. I am a monkey born through wind-god and through his influence I am equal to the wind-god in strength."

[Text] Hanuma gives Seetha, the signet ring sent by Rama through him in order to strengthen 
her confidence in Seetha felt very happy to see the ring and praised Hanuma for his arrival to Lanka 
after having crossed the sea single handedly. She expresses her hope to Hanuma, saying that Rama, Lakshmana, 
Bharata and Sugreeva will come to Lanka with their armies so as to destroy Ravana, for her sake. Hearing 
Seetha's words, Hanuma consoles Seetha saying that Rama, Sugreeva and a host of monkeys will come to 
Lanka by crossing the ocean, so as to defeat Ravana and his army, with assurance that Rama will appear 
before her shortly.

Shlok 1: Hanuma, the highly energetic son of wind-god, with an inducement to obtain confidence 
from Seetha, again modestly spoke the following words:

Shlok 2: "O illustrious lady! I am a monkey and a messenger of the wise Rama. O princess! Look 
at this ring too, marked with Rama's name."

Shlok 3: "I brought this ring given by the high souled Rama, for the purpose of gaining your confidence. 
Get consoled indeed. Happiness to you! You are now free from the object of your grief."

Shlok 4: "I brought this ring given by the high souled Rama, for the purpose of gaining your confidence. 
Get consoled indeed. Happiness to you! You are now free from the object of your grief."

Shlok 5- 6: The countenance of that large-eyed Seetha, which appeared charming with red and white 
eyes shone like a moon the king of stars liberated by Rahu the demon. Then, that young Seetha, gladdened 
by the message of her husband, became shy and message of her husband, became shy and well-pleased. Uttering 
delightful words, she praised Hanuma the great monkey (as follows):

Shlok 7: "O Hanuma the best of monkeys! You have singly overpowered this place infested by demons. 
You are valiant. You are competent. You are intelligent."

Shlok 8: "You, with an acclaimable gallantry, crossed the ocean having a width of one hundred 
Yojanas and an asylum of crocodiles, making it as a small puddle."

Shlok 9: "O excellent of monkeys! For you there is no fear nor even bewilderment from Ravana. 
Hence, I do not consider you as an ordinary monkey."

Shlok 10: "O the best of monkeys! If you are sent by that Rama, who knows the nature of his self, 
you are worthy of talking to me well."

Shlok 11: "The indomitable Rama must not have sent you indeed, especially to me, without knowing 
your enterprise and without testing you in advance."

Shlok 12: "Rama the righteous man who is true to his promise and Lakshmana of great splendour who 
enriches the joy of Sumitra are fortunately safe."

Shlok 13: "If Rama is safe, with his anger why is he not scorching the earth with ocean as its 
belt, like rising fire at the end of the world?"

Shlok 14: "Otherwise, Rama and Lakshmana are capable of holding down even the celestials. But I 
think there is no end indeed to my troubles."

Shlok 15: "Is not Rama getting perturbed? Is he not tormented with grief? Is Rama the best of men 
now doing the right acts to annihilate the enemies?"

Shlok 16: "Is Rama the prince miserable and confused? Is he even mistaken in his actions? I hope 
he is doing all acts which require human effort."

Shlok 17: "Is Rama the annihilator of enemies as per necessity resorting to the two strategies 
viz., conciliatory and partaking approaches and even the three strategies viz., partaking, sowing dissension 
and open assault? Is he kind-hearted towards friends, with a wish to conquer the enemies?"

Shlok 18: "Is he getting friends? Has he been approached for friendship by others? I hope he is 
having good friends and even so honoured by them."

Shlok 19: "Is Rama the prince wishing the grace of the gods? Is he equally aware of the role of 
human endeavour and the role of fate?"

Shlok 20: "O Hanuma! Is Rama not losing affection in me because of my staying away from home? Will 
he release me from this evil predicament?"

Shlok 21: "Is Rama, who is habituated always to pleasures and not habituated to pains, not sinking 
into despondency by now getting this great pain?"

Shlok 22: "Are you constantly hearing the news of safety of Kausalya, Sumitra and Bharata?"

Shlok 23: "Is Rama worthy of honour, suffering from pain just because of me? Will he liberate me 
from my sorrow, without fixing his mind on something else?"

Shlok 24: "I hope Bharata, having a brotherly affection, will send for my sake, an army furnished 
with banners, guarded by the ministers, consisting of ten anikinis (21870 elephants, 21870 chariots, 
65610 horses and 109350 foot soldiers) which were terrific in appearance."

Shlok 25: "The glorious Sugreeva the lord of monkeys will indeed come for my sake along with his 
valiant monkeys, who have their tusks and nails as their weapons."

Shlok 26: "Lakshmana, the strong man, who augments the joy of Sumitra and who is an expert in weaponry, 
will indeed destroy the demons by the multitude of his arrows."

Shlok 27: "Within a short time, I hope see Ravana killed along with his companions in the battle-field 
by terrific weapons burning brightly."

Shlok 28: "That face of Rama with its golden and with the fragrance of a lotus may be looking miserable 
as bereft of me and getting dehydrated too. I hope it is not parched by the sun, like a louts."

Shlok 29: "Which Rama left the kingdom as an indication of his righteousness and to whom there 
was neither disturbance nor fear nor sorrow even while taking me to the forest by foot, I hope that 
the same Rama is maintaining boldness in his heart."

Shlok 30: "To Rama, in the matter of affection, neither his mother nor his father nor any body 
else is equal to or more than me. O Hanuma the messenger! I wish to survive only as long as I hear the 
activity of my beloved."

Shlok 31: Uttering thus those greatly meaningful and sweetly worthwhile words, Seetha the princess 
further abstained from talking so as to hear Hanuma's delightful words describing the matters pertaining 
to Rama.

Shlok 32: Hearing Seetha's words, Hanuma of terrific prowess, keeping his joined palms on his head, 
spoke the following words in reply.

Shlok 33: "O Seetha having lotus eyes! Rama does not know that you are here. For that reason, he 
did not take you back soon, as Indra the destroyer of strong holds did not take back Sachi, his wife."

Shlok 34: "Soon after hearing my words, Rama will come soon, drawing forth a large army, consisting 
of a multitude of monkeys and bears."

Shlok 35: "Rama will paralyze the imperturbable ocean with his flood of arrows and make the City 
of Lanka extinguished of demons."

Shlok 36: "If the goddess of Death along with demons or celestials stand firmly in the way of Rama 
at that time, he will kill them also."

Shlok 37: "O noble lady! Being full of grief caused by your non-appearance, that Rama is not obtaining 
happiness, like an elephant tornmented by a lion."

Shlok 38- 39: "O Seetha the princess! I swear and tell you by the mountains Malaya, Vindhya, Meru and 
Dardura as well as by our staple food of roots and fruits, that you will soon see Rama's face, having 
good eyes, handsome, having lips with the colour of a bright-red gourd (fruit of Momordica monodelpha) 
and with its charming look like a rising full moon."

Shlok 40: "O Seetha! You will see soon Rama on the Prasravana mountain, like Indra the Lord of 
celestials seated on the back of Airavata, the chief of elephants."

Shlok 41: "Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, 
he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him."

Shlok 42: "With his mind wholly devoted to you, Rama is not even driving away forest-flies from 
his body, nor mosquitoes nor insects nor reptiles from his body."

Shlok 43: "Rama always cogitates on something or the other. He is forever engaged in sorrow. He 
is enamoured with the god of love and thinks of nothing else."

Shlok 44: "Rama mostly does not have sleep. Even if that best of men sleeps, he keeps awake uttering 
sweet words like "lo! Behold! Seetha!"

Shlok 45: "When he happens to see a fruit or a flower or any other beautiful object, he recollects 
of you and says 'O beloved!' many times and breathes a sigh."

Shlok 46: "O Seetha the princess! Rama the magnanimous prince is always lamenting, speaking just 
about you, recollecting "Seetha, Seetha!". Being firm in his vow, he makes effort to find you only."

Shlok 47: "That Seetha, who has the same amount of grief as that of Rama, became worn out of her 
grief upon hearing the adoration of Rama, like a night with the moon obscured by the remnant clouds 
at the commencement of autumn."



SARGA 37
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha was both delighted and depressed respectively on hearing Rama's episode from Hanuma 
and Rama's overwhelmed sorrow caused by his dissociation from her. She beseeches Hanuma to arrange for 
Rama's arrival to Lanka to meet her within two months, the period remaining out of the time-limit for 
her survival given by Ravana. Hanuma consoles Seetha, saying that Rama would surely come to see her. 
He also offers Seetha to carry her on his back to Rama's presence at Prasravana Mountain. Looking to 
the small size of Hanuma's body; Seetha doubts his capability to do it. Then, Hanuma assumes a gigantic 
form, so as to inspire confidence in Seetha. However, explaining various reasons, Seetha declines to 
go with him and requests Hanuma to bring her husband to Lanka.

Shlok 1: Hearing Hanuma's words, Seetha whose face resembled the full moon, spoke the following 
words braced with justice and utility, to Hanuma.

Shlok 2: "O Hanuma! The words spoken by you viz. that Rama is not having any other thoughts (than 
on me) and is fully overwhelmed by sorrow are like ambrosia mixed with poisons."

Shlok 3: "Destiny drags out a man into a very extensive fortune or into a very dreadful adversity, 
as if being dragged, tied with ropes."

Shlok 4: "O Hanuma the best of monkeys! For living beings, destiny is surely irresistible. See 
how Lakshmana, myself and Rama are baffled by misfortunes."

Shlok 5: "When will Rama reach the end of this grief any more than a thoroughly fatigued man, 
having suffered a ship wreck is swimming in the middle of the sea?"

Shlok 6: "When will my husband see me, after annihilation of the demons, killing of Ravana and 
making the City of Lanka debacled?."

Shlok 7: "Till the current period of one year is not completed, that Rama is to be told to make 
haste to save me; since my life will be lasting till such time only."

Shlok 8: "O Hanuma! Out of the time-limit given to me by the cruel Ravana for my survival, the 
tenth month is now running. Only two months are left out."

Shlok 9: "Even when humbly entreated with continued exertion by Vibhishana his brother about my 
restoration (to Rama), Ravana is not making up his mind to do so."

Shlok 10: "My restoration is not agreeable to Ravana. In the battle, death lies in wait for Ravana, 
who has become subject to the power of Time."

Shlok 11: "O Hanuma! Nala, the eldest maiden daughter of Vibhishana, when she was sent personally 
to me by her mother, told me about this."

Shlok 12: "O Hanuma the excellent of monkeys! Rama, my husband, will soon regain me without any 
doubt. Because my heart is pure and in Rama also, there are many good qualities existing."

Shlok 13: "O Hanuma! In Rama are figured, pesseverence, manliness, courage, non-mischievousness, 
gratitude, prowess and energy."

Shlok 14: "Which Rama, who without the help of Lakshmana his brother, killed fourteen thousand 
demos in Janasthana (part of the forest), what adversary will not have fear of such a man?"

Shlok 15: "Rama, the excellent among men, is not compelled to be moved by troubles. I now well 
the energy of Rama, as Shachi the wife of Indra knows the energy of Indra the Lord of celestials."

Shlok 16: "O Hanuma! The powerful Rama like the sun, with his multitude of ray-like arrows, will 
dry up the water in the form of hostile adversaries."

Shlok 17: Hanuma spoke the following words to Seetha, who was thus talking with grief for Rama 
and with her eyes full of tears."

Shlok 18: "Soon after hearing my words, Rama will soon come, engaging a great army comprising of 
a multitude of monkeys and bears with him."

Shlok 19: "O Seetha with a charming face! Or rather, I shall relieve you from this grief now itself. 
O irreproachable lady! Ascend my back. I shall take you to Rama."

Shlok 20: "I shall cause you sit on my back and cross the ocean. I have indeed capacity to carry 
even Lanka together with Ravana."

Shlok 21: "O Seetha! Now itself, I shall cause you to reach Rama who is staying at Prasravana Mountain, 
even as fire-god hands over the oblations offered in the sacrifices to Indra the Lord of celestials."

Shlok 22: "O Seetha! Now itself, you can see Rama together with Lakshmana, getting ready for a 
strenuous effort to annihilate the demons, as Vishnu the Lord of Preservation getting ready for killing 
of demons."

Shlok 23: "The mighty Rama, with a gusto to see you, is staying in a hermitage, even as Indra the 
destroyer of strong-holds sitting on the back of Airavata the elephant."

Shlok 24: "O Seetha the auspicious princess! Mount on my back. Do not have any hesitation. Be inclined 
of joining Rama even as Rohini, moon's favourite wife, joined the moon."

Shlok 25: "You ascend my back and cross the ocean by journeying through the sky, as though speaking 
to the greatly resplendent sun and to the moon."

Shlok 26: "O Seetha! While I am taking you from here, no body staying in Lanka is competent to 
come along with me."

Shlok 27: "O Seetha! In what manner I reached here, in the same manner, I shall move through the 
sky, taking you along with me. See, there is no doubt."

Shlok 28: Hearing those astonishing words from Hanuma, Seetha with her entire limbs flowered with 
joy, thereafter spoke to Hanuma (as follows):

Shlok 29: "O Hanuma! How are you wishing to carry me for such a long distance? O chief of monkeys! 
I consider this indeed as your apishness!"

Shlok 30: "O Hanuma the best of monkeys! With such a small seized body, how do you wish to take 
me from here to the presence of my husband, Rama the Lord of human beings?"

Shlok 31: Hearing the words of Seetha, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought it to 
be the first insult was caused to him.

Shlok 32: (Hanuma said to himself); "The black-eyed Seetha is not aware of my strength or power. 
That is why, let her see the form I can assume at will."

Shlok 33: Hanuma, the best of monkeys and the annihilator of enemies, thinking in this way, then 
showed his peculiarity to Seetha.

Shlok 34: Hanuma, the intelligent and the excellent of monkeys, leaped down from that tree and 
then, to create confidence in Seetha, started to increase his body-form.

Shlok 35: Hanuma, the foremost of monkeys, flashed like Meru and Mandara mountains, shining brightly 
like a blazing fire. He thus stood too in front of Seetha.

Shlok 36: The mighty Hanuma, resembling a mountain, having a red face, having teeth and nails as 
hard as adamant and terrific in appearance, spoke the following words to Seetha.

Shlok 37: "To me, there is capability to carry this Lanka along with its hills, forest-areas, market-places, 
defensive walls and arches together with its Lord Ravana himself."

Shlok 38: "O princess! For this reason, leave your suspicion and keep you mind steady. Come along 
with me and make Rama and Lakshmana bereft of grief."

Shlok 39: Seetha, with her large eyes resembling lotus-petals, spoke to that terrific Hanuma, the 
son of wind-god (as follows)

Shlok 40: "O great monkey! I know fully well your courage, strength, your power of movement like 
that of the wind and your wonderful brilliance like that of the fire."

Shlok 41: "O the best of monkeys! How can any other common person cross this unfathomable ocean 
and reach this place?"

Shlok 42: "I know your capacity of carrying and taking me from here. However, we have to determine 
soon whether the accomplishment of work by the high souled Rama would not thus get spoiled."

Shlok 43: "O the faultless one! O the excellent of monkeys! It is not befitting of me to go with 
you. For, your speed resembling the winds speed, may bewilder my mind."

Shlok 44: "Reaching the sky high above the sea, I will fall down out of fear from your back even 
as you sweep with speed."

Shlok 45: "Having fallen insensible into the sea, which is filled with sharks, crocodiles and giant 
fish, I may become the best food soon for the aquatic creatures."

Shlok 46: "O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! It is not possible for me to go with you. There 
will also be a risk for you, having me a lady additionally to protect. There is no doubt."

Shlok 47: "Seeing me being taken away by you, the demons of terrific prowess, incited by the evil-minded 
Ravana, will follow you."

Shlok 48: "O brave monkey! Those valiant demons wielding darts and clubs in their hands will surround 
you. Accompanied by a lady in me, you will be at a risk."

Shlok 49: "Many demons will come with their weapons, in the sky. You will be alone without any 
weapon. How can you continue your travel, while protecting me?"

Shlok 50: "O the best of monkeys! While you will be resorting to battle with those demons, who 
perform cruel acts, I, stricken with fear, may fall down from your back."

Shlok 51: "O excellent of monkeys! Then the powerful and terrific demons with their giant bodies 
will conquer you in battle, somehow or other."

Shlok 52: "Otherwise, if you are indifferent of me and resort to battle, I may eventually fall 
down. Then, the wicked demons, catching hold of me fallen, may take me again to Lanka."

Shlok 53: "Or they may take me away from your hand, or may even kill me. In battle, victory and 
defeat are perceived as uncertain."

Shlok 54: "O the best of monkeys! Or while I am frightened by the demons, I may get into a mishap. 
Thus, your effort may become futile indeed!"

Shlok 55: "You may be surely able to kill all the demons. But if you alone kill all the demons, 
Rama's celebrity will be lowered."

Shlok 56: "Otherwise, the demons may take me away and hide me in any secret place that will not 
be known by those monkeys or even Rama and Lakshmana."

Shlok 57: "Then your effort taken for my sake will become futile. That is why there is a great 
merit in Rama's coming here along with you."

Shlok 58: "O Hanuma the long-armed! The survival of the high souled Rama, his brothers, of yourself 
and of your royal family (of Sugreeva) is dependent on me."

Shlok 59: "Those two men Rama and Lakshmana who are emaciated by grief and anguish along with all 
bears and monkeys, losing their hope, will abandon their lives."

Shlok 60: "O Hanuma, the best of monkeys! Honouring the devotion to my husband, I cannot touch 
the body of any man other that of Rama."

Shlok 61: "That I got, by force, the touch of Ravana's body, was because being helpless, having 
lost control of myself and without a protector, I could not do anything."

Shlok 62: "If Rama kills Ravana here along with his relatives and departs taking me from here, 
it would be proper for him"

Shlok 63: "I have not only heard but seen myself about the strength of the high souled Rama destroying 
enemies in battle. Neither the celestials nor the divine musicians nor the serpent-gods nor the demons 
are equal to Rama in combat."

Shlok 64: "Who can withstand seeing in battle that mighty Rama, dazzling like fire fanned by wind, 
wielding his conspicuous bow and having prowess equal to that of Indra the Lord of celestials, together 
with Lakshmana?"

Shlok 65: "O the best of monkeys! In battle, who can endure Rama resembling the sun at noon-time, 
with his arrows resembling its rays, the destroyer in battle, stationed like a mythical elephant in 
rut, along with Lakshmana?

Shlok 66: "O the excellent of monkeys! You, as such, soon bring my husband here along with Lakshmana, 
and the chiefs of army. O the best of monkeys! I am emaciated with grief about Rama since long. Make 
me now joyful."



SARGA 38
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma asks Seetha to give him a token of remembrance, which Rama can recognize. Seetha 
then narrates the episode of a crow which occurred on the Chitrakuta mountain and requests Hanuma to 
repeat it before Rama by way of a token of recollection. She further sends greetings to both Rama and 
Lakshmana, conveys her enquiry about their welfare and conveys to them her resolve to survive only for 
a month after the expiry of the time-limit given by Ravana. Thereupon, she hands over to Hanuma her 
jewel for the head as a token of remembrance.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words of Seetha, the eloquent Hanuma was very much pleased and spoke to 
Seetha (as follows):

Shlok 2: "O Seetha, the beautiful princess! Whatever you spoke is befitting. It is in keeping 
with woman's nature and humility of a chaste women."

Shlok 3: "It is indeed not fit for a woman to mount on my back and traverse an extensive ocean, 
which is having a width of one hundred yojanas."

Shlok 4- 5: "O Seetha endowed with modesty! The second reason you mentioned that you would not be 
touching any one else other then Rama is befitting of you, the wife of that high soled Rama. O princess! 
which other lady except you can speak of such sweet words?"

Shlok 6: "O princess! I can completely inform Rama of all that you have done and of all that you 
have spoken before me."

Shlok 7: "O princess! All this was told by me because of several reasons, being desirous of doing 
good to Rama ad with my mind moistened with affection towards him."

Shlok 8: "I spoke this because of the unassailability of Lanka, its great ocean so difficult to 
be crossed and also my capacity of taking you."

Shlok 9: "Because of my great affection and devotion towards you, I wish to carry you well now 
itself to Rama your hushand. These words were not spoken by me with any other motive."

Shlok 10: "O faultless Seetha! If you are not willing to go with me, give me a token of remembrance 
which Rama can recognise."

Shlok 11: Hearing Hanuma's words, Seetha like the daughter of a god, slowly spoke the following 
words, strung together with alphabets of tears: "You tell this (following) excellent thing as a token 
of remembrance to my beloved husband."

Shlok 12- 13- 14: "There is a place inhabited by sages at a hillock in the north-eastern It was bountiful 
with roots fruits and water. In that place, while we were residing in a hermitage of sages, on a day 
long ago, we were strolling in water in parts of groves with various kinds of flowers of perfume in 
that hillock. Your thereupon became wet and sat at my proximity."

Shlok 15: "Then, a crow, yearning for meat, began to peck me. Picking up a clod of earth, I prevented 
the crow from its act."

Shlok 16: "Pecking me again and again, the crow was hiding there only. That crow, yearning for 
food, did not resig from meat."

Shlok 17: "While I was angry with that bird, my skirt was slipping and I was pulling its string 
(so as to tighten it). I was seen by you then."

Shlok 18: "Moved by anger, I felt abashed for being laughed at by you. Torn down by the crow, which 
was yearning for food, I sought shelter with you."

Shlok 19: "Feeling tired, I again settled on your lap. As though angry, I was consoled by you and 
I was fully delighted."

Shlok 20: "Slowly wiping my eyes, my face filled with tears, I was seen by you, O Lord, as having 
been annoyed by the crow."

Shlok 21: "I even slept for a long time on Rama's lap because of my fatigue. In his turn, Rama 
the elder brother of Bharata, slept in my arms."

Shlok 22- 23: "Meanwhile, the same crow appeared there. Descending all of a sudden, the crow clawed 
me at the space between the breasts, even as I awoke from my sleep and rose from the lap of Rama. Flying 
up again, it tore me up a lot."

Shlok 24: "Then, Rama got wet by the discharged drops of blood. Thereafter, that splendorous Rama, 
the annihilator of enemies, who was in a pleasant slumber, was woken up by that crow and by me who was 
grievously tormented by the crow."

Shlok 25: "That long-armed Rama, seeing me pierced violently on the breasts, then spoke the following 
words, hissing like an angry serpant.

Shlok 26: "O Seetha the round-thighed woman! Who has wounded the space between your breasts? who 
is playing with a fire-faced serpent filled with fury?"

Shlok 27: 'Then, throwing a glance around, Rama saw that crow with its sharp claws moistened iwth 
blood and sitting in front of me alone."

Shlok 28: "That crow, the best among birds, seems to be the son of Indra the Lord of celestials, 
staying in mountains and moving with a peed equal to the wind."

Shlok 29: "Then, the long-armed Rama, the best among wise men, swirling his eyes in anger, made 
a resolve in the matter of that ferocious crow."

Shlok 30: "Taking a blade of Kusa grass from his bed ( made of Kusa grass), Rama employed it to 
work with Brahma's missile (a mythical weapon which deals with infallible destruction). That blazing 
shoot of grass, resembling a fire destroying the world, flared up in front of that bird."

Shlok 31: "As Rama threw that blazing blade of Kusa grass towards that crow, that blade of grass 
went chasing that crow in the sky."

Shlok 32: "Then, while that blade of grass came chasing, that crow went flying in many a way. Seeking 
protection, it roamed all over the world."

Shlok 33: "Roaming the three worlds in search of a saviour, that crow was abandoned by Indra; its 
father, the celestials and the sages. Finally, it sought refuge in the same Rama."

Shlok 34: "That Rama, who affords protection, was compassionate and protected that crow, which 
fell on the ground (in salutation to Rama) and sought for protection, eventhough it was apt to be killed."

Shlok 35: "Seeing that crow, coming exhausted and dejected, Rama said to it: 'It is not possible 
to make Brahma missile a waste. For this reason, tell me what to do now."

Shlok 36: Thereafter, that crow said "Let your arrow shoot my right eye." Then that blade of Kusa 
grass shooted the right eye of that crow. By giving away its right eye in that way, the crow saved its 
life."

Shlok 38: "After offering salutations to Rama and King Dasaratha and being discharged by that valiant 
Rama, the crow returned to its own abode."

Shlok 39: "O lord of the earth! For my sake you hurled a Brahma's missile even at a crow. Why are 
you forgiving the one who has taken me away from you?"

Shlok 40: "O Rama the best among men! You, with great strength, annihilate the enemy and bestow 
your mercy on me. O Lord! She who has a protector in you, actually looks like one without any protector."

Shlok 41- 42: "You yourself told me that kindness is the best righteousness. I know you, having a great 
prowess, a great energy, and a great strength. I know your non-acquiescence, imperturbability, profoundness 
like an ocean, as Lord of the earth including the oceans and as equal to Indra the Lord of celestials."

Shlok 43: "O Rama! Eventhough you are strong, excellently skilled in archery and a truthful man, 
why are you not utilizing your arrow on demons?"

Shlok 44: "Neither the serpent-demons, nor the divine musicians nor the demons nor the storm-gods 
are able to resist the onrush of Rama in battle."

Shlok 45: "If the valiant Rama has any haste in my case, why does he not destroy the demons with 
his sharp arrows?!

Shlok 46: "For what reason, even Lakshmana the tormentator of enemies, the mighty man and the valiant 
man does not protect me, by taking the command of his elder brother?'

Shlok 47: Those two tigers among men, Rama and Lakshmana, with a sharpness equal to that of wind 
and fire, even if they are unconquerable by demons too, why are they neglecting me?"

Shlok 48: "There is not doubt that I would have committed a great sin, for which reason those two 
brothers Rama and Lakshmana the tormentators of enemies, even when capable , are neglecting me."

Shlok 49: Hearing the pitiable appeal Seetha with tears, Hanuma of great splendour and the son 
of wind-god spoke (as follows)

Shlok 50: "O Seetha! Rama has grown averse to everything else, caused by grief towards you. I swear 
it to you by truth. When Rama is overpowered by grief; Lakshmana too gets tormented by grief."

Shlok 51: "O faultless Seetha! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not the 
time to lament. Your will see the end of your sorrow within a short time."

Shlok 52: "Those two mighty princes, the excellent among men, are eager to see you and they will 
reduce Lanka to ashes."

Shlok 53: "O large-eyed Seetha! Killing the cruel Ravana along with his relatives in battle, Rama 
will take you back to his own city."

Shlok 54: "Tell me what to be expressed to Rama or to the mighty Lakshmana or to the splendourous 
Sugreeva or even to the other monkeys assembled there."

Shlok 55: Hearing the words of Hanuma, Seetha, like the daughter of a sage, tormented with grief, 
spoke to Hanuma the monkey (as follows):

Shlok 56: "On my behalf, salute by bowing your head and ask about the welfare of Rama, the Lord 
of the worlds, whom the magnanimous Kausalya gave birth."

Shlok 57- 58: (On my behalf, ask about the welfare of ) Lakshmana, that good child of Sumitra who, 
having renounced the wreaths of flowers, all the riches, pleasant and beautiful girls and even the prosperity 
difficult to be obtained in this extensive world, offered his profound respects to and pacified his 
father and mother, followed Rama to exile."

Shlok 59: "Renouncing a great comfort, the righteous Lakshmana, acting in an affectionate manner 
towards Rama, followed him, watching over him in the forest."

Shlok 60: "Lakshmana, who has broad shoulders like that ofa lion, mighty-armed, steady-minded and 
having pleasant looks, behaves towards Rama as towards his father and looks to me as his own mother."

Shlok 61: "The valiant Lakshmana, on that day of occurrence, did not know that I was being taken 
away by Ravana. He serves elders. He possesses a splendour. Though capable, he does not talk much. To 
Dasaratha, my father-in-law, he is his replica a beloved and the best prince."

Shlok 62: "Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama is the one who is dearer to me always. That energetic 
Lakshmana carries out well, whatever load of work is entrusted to him"

Shlok 63: "Seeing whom, Rama ceases to recollect his deceased father, that Lakshmana is to be asked 
about his well-being, as my word and on my behalf."

Shlok 64- 65: "O Hanuma, the excellent of monkeys and the best of monkeys! you are the model for fulfilling 
this act of addressing him in such a way that Lakshmana, the mild, every-pure and clever darling of 
Rama may bring my sorrows to an end."

Shlok 66: "Depending on your effort, Rama will be more active with his effort the following words 
again and again to Rama, my Lord and the hero:"

Shlok 67: "O Rama! I shall hold my life for a month. I cannot survive after a month I am telling 
you the truth."

Shlok 68: "O valiant man! You are required to rescue me, detained (as I am) by Ravana the criminal 
and subjected to humiliation, as you (as Lord Vishnu) earlier protected Indra the Lord of celestials 
and Lakshmi the goddess of prosperity from the abode of servants and demons."

Shlok 69: Then, untying the bright devine jewel for her head tied in her garment, Seetha gave it 
to Hanuma, saying that it might be handed over to Rama.

Shlok 70: Taking the excellent jewel, the valiant Hanuma thereupon fitted it to his finger, since 
his arm (eventhough he had assumed his former tiny form), was not fitting to it properly.

Shlok 71: Receiving that jewel, Hanuma the best among the monkeys, offered his salutation to seetha, 
by engaging himself in circumambulation and stood aside with humbleness.

Shlok 72: Filled with a great delight, born out of Seetha's discovery by him, that Hanuma mentally 
sought (the presence) of Rama but stood there with just his physical body.

Shlok 73: Taking that excellent and highly venerable jewel, worn by Seetha and by its influence 
resembling one who was shaken by a blast coming from the top of a huge mountain, Hanuma was mentally 
pleased and set out for crossing the ocean in his return journey.



SARGA 39
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha asks Hanuma, who is prepared to depart with the jewel for her head, to convey 
her enquiries about the welfare of Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva. She further requests Hanuma to urge 
them to rescue her. Then, Seetha expresses her doubt about the capacity of Rama, Lakshmana and the troops 
of monkeys and bears to cross the ocean. Hanuma explains to Seetha about the strength of monkey-heroes 
and assures her about their ability to cross the ocean. In the end, Hanuma consoles Seetha by promising 
to bring Rama and Lakshmana on his back across the sea so that they will together destroy the City of 
Lanka.

Shlok 1: Then, after giving the jewel for head, Seetha spoke to Hanuma as follows: "This token 
of remembrance is actually known to Rama."

Shlok 2: "By seeing this jewel, the heroic Rama can recollect three of us, viz. my mother, myself 
and the king Dasaratha."

Shlok 3: "O Hanuma the excellent among monkeys! Driven by your enthusiasm again, think what remains 
to be done in undertaking this task."

Shlok 4: "O Hanuma the best among monkeys! You are capable of fulfilling this task. O Hanuma! 
Become the one who can remove my misfortunes, by employing your effort. If you think of it carefully, 
your effort will become the one which can remove my misfortunes."

Shlok 5: That Hanuma of terrific prowess, having promised 'so be it', offered salutation to Seetha 
by bowing his head to her and was set off to go.

Shlok 6: Getting to know Hanuma ready to set out, Seetha the princess spoke the following words 
with her voice choked by tears.

Shlok 7- 8: "O Hanuma, the excellent among monkeys! Ask about the welfare of both Rama and Lakshmana 
together. You also ask, according to our usage, about the welfare of Sugreeva together with his ministers 
and of all the monkeys who are elder."

Shlok 9: "You deserve to evolve a strategy through which the long-armed Rama can make me to cross 
over this ocean of misfortunes."

Shlok 10: "O Hanuma! Tell, in whatever manner, by which the illustrious Rama can console me, even 
while I am still surviving. Reap righteousness, by helping me through your word."

Shlok 11: "Constantly hearing the words endowed with energy spoken by you, Rama's manly strength 
will be intensified to recover me."

Shlok 12: 'Hearing the words containing my message from you, the valiant Rama will duly set his 
heart in exercising his strength."

Shlok 13: Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god, having placed his open hands 
side by side, slightly shallowed on his head in salutation), spoke the following words in reply.

Shlok 14: "Coming soon together with valiant monkeys and bears, Rama after defeating the enemies 
in battle, will eliminate your sorrow."

Shlok 15: "While discharging his arrows, none can be seen either in men or in monkeys or in celestials 
who are able to stand before Rama in battle."

Shlok 16: "That Rama is capable of enduring even the sun-god, even Indra the god of rain or even 
Yama the god of death, son of the sun-god a battle-field especially for your sake."

Shlok 17: "Rama is indeed worthwhile to master the entire earth bounded by the ocean. O Seetha! 
Rama's victory is indeed for your sake."

Shlok 18: Hearing those words of Hanuma, spoken rightly and truly well, Seetha held him in great 
respect and proceeded to speak (the following) words:

Shlok 19: Thereupon, looking again and again towards that Hanuma who was going away, Seetha kind-heartedly 
adored his words endowed with friendliness for her husband.

Shlok 20: "O valiant monkey, the annihilator of enemies! If you are agreeable, stay for a day at 
any one secret place. After taking rest, you can go tomorrow."

Shlok 21: "O Hanuma! Because of your vicinity, there may be a relief for a moment to this great 
sorrow of me, who is less fortunate."

Shlok 22: "O Hanuma the lion among the monkeys! If after that, there is any doubt about your return, 
there is a doubt even for my survival too. There is no suspicion about this matter."

Shlok 23: 'O Hanuma! To me, who is tormented by one grief after another grief, my sorrow due to 
your disappearance will further torment me, like a burning flame."

Shlok 24: "O best among the monkeys! O valiant one! In the matter of monkeys and bears who are 
your helpmates, this highly great doubt is lingering before me."

Shlok 25: "How indeed can those troops of monkeys and bears or Rama and Lakshmana can cross that 
great insurmountable ocean?"

Shlok 26: "Three beings viz. Garuda the eagle, or yourself or the wind-god only have the capacity 
of crossing this ocean."

Shlok 27: "O valiant monkey! That is why, what strategy are you visualizing to fulfill this act, 
which is thus impassable? You are indeed excellent of those who know how to accomplish a task.

Shlok 28: "O Hanuma the annihilator of hostile enemies! You, as one alone, is capable of fulfilling 
this task. Your act of fulfilling the result is well-known."

Shlok 29: "If Rama defeats Ravana with his entire army in battle and as a champion takes me back 
to his own city, it will be quite worthy of him."

Shlok 30: "If Rama, the destroyer of rival army, fills the entire Lanka with his arrows and takes 
me home, it will be quite worthy of him."

Shlok 31: "For that reason, you act in such a way, that Rama the high-souled man, valiant in battle, 
may exhibit the prowess befitting of him."

Shlok 32: Hearing those words, which were meaningful humble and attended with reason, Hanuma gave 
his final reply (as follows)

Shlok 33: "O Seetha the princess! Sugreeva, the Lord of the troops of monkeys and bears and the 
premost among the monkeys, who is endowed with strength, is firmly determined in your cause."

Shlok 34: "O Seetha! That Sugreeva, endowed with thousands and crores of monkeys, will come soon 
to destroy the demons."

Shlok 35: "So many monkeys, endowed with prowess, perseverance, great strength and who can rush 
to any place as they wish are intensely committed to Sugreeva's command.

Shlok 36: "There is no hindrance to their movement either in the sky or in the ground or in any 
horizontal region (between the sky and the ground) with unlimited splendour are not indolent in performing 
any great task."

Shlok 37: "The earth with its oceans and mountains has been circumambulated clockwise many times 
by those monkeys, who are highly energetic and who follow the aerial path."

Shlok 38: "In them, some of the monkeys are superior to me and some are even equal to me. No one 
in the vicinity of Sugreeva is inferior to me."

Shlok 39: "When I have arrived here, why to talk about the mighty ones? Generally, superior ones 
are not sent for errands. Only others are indeed sent."

Shlok 40: "O Seetha the princess! Enough of your lamentation. Take away your sorrow. Those leaders 
of monkeys will reach Lanka by one single leap."

Shlok 41: "Rama and Lakshmana, those two lions among men also of great strength, ascending on my 
shoulders, can come to you, like the rising sun and the moon."

Shlok 42: "Coming together, Rama and Lakshmana the valiant and the excellent among men, can destroy 
the City of Lanka with their arrows."

Shlok 43: "O Seetha with a good waist! Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, killing Ravana together 
with his troops, will return to his town, duly taking you with him."

Shlok 44: "For that reason, console yourself indeed! Happiness to you! If you wait for some time, 
you shall see, within a short time, Rama like a blazing fire."

Shlok 45: "When this king of demons is killed along with his sons, ministers and relatives, you 
will meet Rama, as Rohini* met the moon."

[Commentary] *Rohini: A consort of the moon-god, presiding over a constellation of the same name.

Shlok 46: "O Seetha the princess! You shall see the end of your sorrow soon. Within a short time, 
you will also see the end of Ravana, as destroyed by Rama."

Shlok 47: Thus consoling Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god made up his mind to go back and spoke 
to Seetha again as follows:

Shlok 48: "That Rama the annihilator of enemies, who firmly decided to destroy his adversaries 
and Lakshmana wielding a bow in his hand will soon reach the entrance of Lanka and you will see them."

Shlok 49: "You can see soon those valiant monkeys, with their claws and tusks as weapons, having 
the prowess of lions and tigers and looking like lordly elephants, coming together."

Shlok 50: "O venerable lady! You shall see many troops of excellent monkeys resembling hills and 
clouds, thundering on the peaks of Malaya mountain in Lanka."

Shlok 51: "Hit in the vitals by the darts of venerable Manmatha the god of love, Rama is not obtaining 
happiness, as an elephant gets tormented by a lion."

Shlok 52: "O Seetha the princess! Do not weep with grief. Let your mind be without any unpleasantness. 
You are indeed having Rama your husband as your protector like Shachi having Indra her husband as a 
protector."

Shlok 53: "Who else is there greater than Rama or who else equal to Lakshmana? Those two brothers, 
like fire and wind, are supportive to you."

Shlok 54: "O Seetha the princess! You will not stay for long at this place, which is very terrific 
and occupied with a multitude of demons. The arrival of your husband will not be delayed. Be patient 
till the moment of my meeting with Rama on my return."



SARGA 40
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha asks Hanuma to remind Rama of how he threw a blade of grass at the crow and destroyed 
its right eye thereby, as a token of remembrance. She also asks to remind Rama of his having once marked 
on her cheek with realgar, when a mark on her forehead was defaced, as a further token of Hanuma having 
met her. Seetha also requests Hanuma to appraise Rama of her wretched plight and finally greets him 
to have a happy journey ahead.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of that high-souled Hanuma, Seetha who resembled the daughter of god, 
spoke the following words beneficial to herself.

Shlok 2: "O Hanuma! Seeing you speaking pleasant words, I am as overjoyed, as a field with half-sprouted 
crop of grain is thrilled by receiving a rain."

Shlok 3: "With my limbs emaciated with grief, I have a desire to touch that Rama the tiger among 
men. Show mercy on me and fulfill my desire."

Shlok 4: "O Hanuma the excellent one among the troops of monkeys! Present the story of the blade 
of grass called Ishika hurled with anger and thereby one eye of the crow destroyed by Rama (as a signal 
remembrance)."

Shlok 5: "O Rama! You ought surely to recollect that while a mark on my forehead had got effaced 
once, another mark with realgar was indeed painted by you on the side of my cheek."

Shlok 6: "How are you, the valiant man equal to Indra the Lord of celestials and Varuna the King 
of Universe, ignore Seetha who was taken away and now staying in the midst of these demons?"

Shlok 7: "O faultless Rama! This wonderful jewel for the head head has been protected well by 
me. Seeing this in my distress, I have been getting delighted, as though I have seen you."

Shlok 8: "This splendid jewel, produced in water, has been sent to you. Absorbed in grief, I shall 
not be able to survive henceforth."

Shlok 9: "With a hope of your coming here at any time, I am enduring these unbearable hardships 
and also the words of horrible female demons; which pierce my heart."

Shlok 10: "O Rama the prince, the annihilator of enemies! I shall hold my life only for a month. 
I will not survive without you, after a month."

Shlok 11: "This Ravana, the king of demons, is terrible. In my instance, his glance is not pleasant. 
Hearing that you are causing a delay, I will not survive even for a moment."

Shlok 12: Hearing the words of Seetha, spoken pitiably with tears, Hanuma the son of wind-god, 
with a great splendour, spoke (as follows):

Shlok 13- 14- 15- 16: "O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown averse to everything else, caused by grief towards 
you. I sear it to you truly. when Rama is overpowered by grief, Lakshmana too gets tormented with grief." 
"O lady! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not the time to lament. You will 
see the end of your sorrow shortly." "Those two princes, the excellent among men, the annihilator of 
enemies and who are eager to see you, will surely reduce Lanka to ashes. "O large-eyed Seetha! Killing 
the cruel Ravana along with his relatives, Rama and Lakshmana will take you to their own city."

Shlok 17: "O faultless Seetha! Be pleased to give another token of remembrance, which Rama will 
recognise and which creates pleasure to him."

Shlok 18: Seetha said, " An excellent token of remembrance was indeed given by me. Seeing this 
jewel for my hair, Rama will trust your words."

Shlok 19: Taking that excellent jewel, the illustrious Hanuma, the best among monkeys, offered 
salutation to Seetha by bowing his head and has set off to go.

Shlok 20- 21: Seeing that Hanuma, the best among monkeys, possessed of energy to jump up with great 
speed and expanding, Seetha spoke (as follows) in her voice choked with tears and looking miserable 
in her face filled with tears.

Shlok 22: "O Hanuma! Enquire about the welfare of Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers looking like 
lions, of Sugreeva together with his ministers and of all other."

Shlok 23: "Be pleased to make that long-armed Rama deliver me from this ocean of sorrow."

Shlok 24: "O valiant monkey! After approaching Rama, appraise him of this terrific gush of my grief 
and also about the threatening attitude of these female-demons. Have a happy journey!"

Shlok 25: Having been appraised of the matter by Seetha the princess, having accomplished his object, 
having his mind filled with joy and having perceived that only a little remained to be done, Hanuma 
intellectually sought the northern direction.



SARGA 41
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma thinks within himself that he should implement the fourth strategy for success, 
viz. open assault with the demons, so as to meet Ravana and his ministers for knowing their designs 
and strengths. Accordingly, he makes up his mind to damage the royal pleasure-garden attached to the 
gynaecium at Lanka and then proceeds to do that task.

Shlok 1: Seetha honoured Hanuma, who was ready to go, with good words. Hanuma, having gone to 
a distance from that place, thought within himself (as follows):

Shlok 2: "I have seen this black-eyed Seetha. There is only a little that remains to be done by 
me. Abandoning the three strategies for success viz. sowing dissension, negotiation and bribery, I have 
to implement here the fourth strategy viz. open assault."

Shlok 3: "In the case of demons, the strategy of negotiation is not practicable. For those persons 
having abundant wealth, the strategy of bribery is not suitable. For persons who are proud of their 
strength, the strategy of sowing dissension is not amenable. Prowess alone is agreeable for me here."

Shlok 4: "Except showing of valour, no strategy in accomplishing this task is adequate in these 
circumstances, for the demons can adopt a weak attitude in the ensuring combat, if their foremost heroes 
are somehow killed here and now."

Shlok 5: "He alone can accomplish his purpose, who implements many (secondary) tasks even after 
the initial task has been carried through, without impairing the previous achievement."

Shlok 6: 'There is indeed no single exclusive method to accomplish a purpose however small a task 
may be. On the other hand, whoever knows to do a task in many ways, he alone is capable of achieving 
that task."

Shlok 7: 'If I go to the abode of Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys, having ascertained the truth as 
to who will predominate in an encounter between the adversary and ourselves here itself, then will the 
command of my master have been carried out by me."

Shlok 8: "How can my combat with the demons now will prove to be a happy one? And, how will my 
strength become fruitful? How indeed will that Ravana applaud me in battle?"

Shlok 9: "Then meeting Ravana with his troop of ministers, his army and his followers in battle 
as well as knowing his designs and strength, I will go back from here happily."

Shlok 10: "This excellent grove of this cruel Ravana, with its various kinds of trees and creepers, 
which is pleasing to the eyes and the mind, is looking like Nandana, Indra's paradise."

Shlok 11: "I will destroy this grove like fire scorching a dried up forest. While this grove gets 
demolished, Ravana will then be angry."

Shlok 12: "Thereupon Ravana will order for an army consisting of horses, great chariots and elephants 
and armed with weapons like great tridents and spears made of iron. Then, a great combat will follow."

Shlok 13: "Attacking those demons of terrific prowess, I too with my unbearable prowess, will kill 
that army instigated by Ravana and return to the place of Sugreeva happily."

Shlok 14: Thereafter, Hanuma of terrific prowess, getting angry, started then to throw away trees 
by a highly violent jerk of his thighs akin to the jerk of a wind.

Shlok 15: Then, the valiant Hanuma laid waste the royal garden attached to the gynaecium resonant 
with cries of birds in heat and endowed with various kinds of trees and creepers.

Shlok 16: Hanuma damaged trees in that grove, destroyed the ponds and crushed the tops of pleasure 
hills to powder. Thus, that grove became nasty at sight.

Shlok 17- 18: With its trees and creepers dried up, with the howls of various birds, with its ponds 
destroyed, with its copper-coloured sprouts dried up there, that grove did not look bright, as though 
it had been destroyed by a wild fire. Those creepers with their bars of support displaced, fell down 
like distressed woman.

Shlok 19: "With its arbours and picture-galleries destroyed, its great serpents and wild animals 
emitting cries of distress, its grottos and other structures demolished, that grove became defaced.

Shlok 20: "That woody land of that pleasure-garden which afforded shelter to the women-folk of 
Ravana and which has clusters of Ashoka creepers became a jumble of creepers of sorrow for the distressed 
women; by the violence of Hanuma."

Shlok 21: Creating a great displeasure to the mind of that high-souled Ravana, the Lord of the 
land of Lanka; that Hanuma decided to fight alone against many mighty demons and stayed



SARGA 42
------------------------------

[Text] Seeing the devastation caused to the pleasant grove by Hanuma the female-demons ask Seetha 
who that great monkey was and wherefore he has come and talked to her. Seetha replies that she knows 
nothing of him. Some of the female-demons go to Ravana and report to him that the pleasant grove attached 
to the gynaecuium has been destroyed by a mighty monkey and that the monkey went to Seetha and talked 
to her also earlier to the devastation. They also report that Seetha expressed her ignorance about him. 
Then, Ravana gets angry and sends some demons called Kinkaras to catch hold of Hanuma. Eighty thousand 
Kinkaras rush towards Hanuma to catch him. But Hanuma, with his might, kills all Kinkaras with an iron 
rod. Getting to know of the killings, Ravana again sends Jambumali, the son of Prahasta to catch hold 
of Hanuma.

Shlok 1: At the screaming sound of birds and at the sound of the crash of falling trees, all the 
inhabitants of Lanka then became trembled with fear.

Shlok 2: Made to run to-and-fro and getting frightened, beasts and birds began to scream. Atrocious 
omens made their appearance before the demons.

Shlok 3: Then, the ugly-faced female-demons, whose sleep has vanished, found that grove demolished 
and saw that great heroic monkey.

Shlok 4: Seeing those female-demons, the mighty armed Hanuma endowed with a great courage and 
might, assumed a gigantic form which created a terror to the female-demons.

Shlok 5: Beholding that mighty monkey having a gigantic body similar to a mountain, the female-demons 
then asked Seetha (as follows):

Shlok 6: "Who is he? Whose messenger is he? From where and for what purpose he has come here? 
Wherefore a conversation was held by him with you?"

Shlok 7: "O large-eyed Seetha! Tell us. Let there be no fear for you, O fortunate lady! What did 
he speak to you? O lady having black outer eye-corners!"

Shlok 8: Thereupon Seetha the virtuous lady, having a complete beauty of all limbs, spoke as follows: 
"Where is the ability for me to know about the demons of a terrific form?"

Shlok 9: "You alone can recognise who he is and what he does. A serpent only can recognise the 
feet of another serpent. There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 10: "By seeing him, I too get frightened. I do not know who he is. I only know him as a demon, 
able to assume any form at his will, who arrived here."

Shlok 11: Hearing the words of Seetha some female-demons fled to different directions. Some stayed 
back. Some others went to Ravana to inform about the matter.

Shlok 12: After approaching Ravana, the female demons of ugly faces started to tell (as follows) 
of the monstrous and terrific monkey.

Shlok 13: "O king! A monkey having a terrific body and a boundless prowess, is stationed in the 
middle of Ashoka grove and made a conversation with Seetha."

Shlok 14: "Eventhough questioned in many ways by us, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, having eyes 
similar to those of a doe, is not inclined to tell about the monkey."

Shlok 15: "He may be a messenger of Indra the Lord of celestials, or the messenger of Kubera the 
king of riches or even a messenger sent by Rama to search for Seetha."

Shlok 16: "He, having a wonderful form, has wiped off your grove, attached to the gynaecium, which 
is fascinating and extending with many kinds of animal-flock."

Shlok 17: "There is no place whatsoever in that grove, which was not destroyed by him. Only that 
place, where Seetha the daughter of Janaka was sitting, was not destroyed by him."

Shlok 18: "It is not known whether to protect Seetha or because of fatigue, he has left that place 
undestroyed, or else, what fatigue is there for him? He has done it to protect Seetha."

Shlok 19: "That well-grown Simsupa tree, abounding in charming sprouts and flowers, under which 
Seetha herself took shelter, has been spared by him."

Shlok 20: To that terribly looking monkey by whom Seetha was spoken to and that grove destroyed you to order a terrible punishment.

Shlok 21: "O chief of the demons-troops! Who would dare to talk to that Seetha, who has been mentally 
accepted by you, except perhaps he who is ready to abandon his life?"

Shlok 22: Hearing the words of the female-demons, Ravana the lord of demons flared up like a funeral 
fire, his eyes spinning with anger.

Shlok 23: Tears dropped from Ravana's enraged eyes, like drops of oil dripping from resplendent 
lamps.

Shlok 24: Ravana, with a great splendour, sent demons with a valiance equal to him, called Kinkaras, 
in order to catch hold of Hanuma.

Shlok 25: He ordered for eighty thousand of those Kinkaras who were strong. All those mighty Kinkaras 
with their large bellies, long tusks and terrible forms, longing to fight with iron mallets and clubs 
in hand, in eagerness to lay hold on Hanuma, started from that place.

Shlok 27: Approaching Hanuma who was standing near the arched doorway, they rushed towards him 
with a great speed, like locusts rushing towards a fire.

Shlok 28: They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold and arrows 
shining like the sun.

Shlok 29: Quickly surrounding Hanuma with clubs, sharp edged spears, iron pikes, lances, javelins 
and swords, they stood in front of him.

Shlok 30: The highly splendorous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his 
tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise.

Shlok 31: The highly splendourous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his 
tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise.

Shlok 32: By that great sound made by Hanuma through clapping on his arms together with a resound, 
birds fell down from the sky. Hanuma also then cried aloud with a clamorous voice (as follows):

Shlok 33: "Long live the mighty Rama and the powerful Lakshmana! Long live the King Sugreeva, protected 
by Rama!"

Shlok 34: "I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am 
the servant of Rama, the king of Kosala Kingdom, who is unwearied in action."

Shlok 35: "Even a thousand of Ravanas will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking 
with thousands of rocks and trees in battle."

Shlok 36: "Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after 
offering salutation to Seetha, I will go back after fully completing my task."

Shlok 37: Those demons became frightened by the clamorous voice of Hanuma cried aloud and saw him 
to be as high as a twilight rain-cloud.

Shlok 38: Not feeling apprehended because of the orders of their king, those demons thereafter 
rushed towards Hanuma, with their terrific and amazing weapons.

Shlok 39: Surrounded on all sides by those strong demons, that Hanuma endowed with a great strength 
seized a huge iron bar belonging to the arched gate.

Shlok 40: Taking that iron rod, Hanuma killed the demons. That violent Hanuma strolled in the sky, 
taking that iron rod in his hand, as Garuda the eagle would carrying a serpent in its claws.

Shlok 41: Killing the valiant demons called Kinkaras, that heroic Hanuma wishing to fight again, 
arrived at the archy gate way.

Shlok 42: Some demons, who somehow escaped from that terror, went to Ravana and informed him that 
all the Kinkaras have been killed.

Shlok 43: Hearing of large army of demons having been killed, that Ravana with his eyes rolling 
rapidly (with anger), ordered Jambumali, son of Prahasta, who was unequal in prowess and admirably unconquerable 
in battle.



SARGA 43
------------------------------

[Text] After damaging the pleasure-grove and after killing the Kinkaras dispatched by Ravana, 
Hanuma thinks of destroying a sanctuary which is sacred to the guardian-deity of the demons. Hanuma 
ascends to the top of the sanctuary and after killing the guards posted there, shows his strength by 
clapping on his arms and by uttering the names of Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva in a roaring voice. Hanuma 
assumes a gigantic form and uplifting a pillar in that sanctuary, he speedily whirls it around and burns 
the sanctuary by producing a fire, created out of its friction with the other pillars.

Shlok 1: After killing the Kinkaras, that Hanuma thought to himself (as follows): "The grove was 
damaged by me. The lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary (sacred to the guardian-deity of the demons) 
has not been destroyed. For that reason, I will cause this mansion to crumble down in the same way." 
Thus thinking himself, Hanuma the best among monkeys, son of the wind-god having large jaws, by showing 
his strength, bounced up and ascended the lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary, which was as high 
as a mountain-top of Meru.

Shlok 4: That Hanuma, an army-chief of monkeys, possessing a very great splendour, ascending the 
lofty palatial mansion similar to a mountain shone like a second rising sun.

Shlok 5: Overpowering the lofty and inviolable of the sanctuary, Hanuma blazing mansion his splendour, 
meta morposed into a towering sized body equal to that of Pariyatra mountain.

Shlok 6: Enhancing his body to a very big size by dint of his distinction, Hanuma clapped on his 
arms strongly, filling the City of Lanka with sound.

Shlok 7: By the great deafening noise, made by clapping on his arms, the birds and also the guards 
protecting the sanctuary unconsciously fell down.

Shlok 8- 9- 10- 11: "Long live Rama, skilled in archery and the powerful Lakshmana! Long lie the King Sugreeva, 
protected by Rama! I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I 
am the servent of Rama, the king of Kosala kingdom, who is unwearied in action. Even a thousand of Ravanas 
will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking with thousnads of rocks and trees in 
battle. Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after offering 
salutation to Seetha, I will go back duly completing my task."

Shlok 12: Thus uttering to those guards protecting the sanctuary, roared terribly, making a noise 
and creating a terror to the demons.

Shlok 13: Hearing that loud noise, hundreds of guards protecting the sanctuary went, taking many 
kinds of weapons, spears, swords and axes. Those Kinkaras with huge bodies surrounded Hanuma, duly discharging 
those weapons.

Shlok 14- 15: They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold and arrows 
shining like the sun. That troop of demons surrounding Hanuma the best among monkeys, shone like a greatly 
extensive whirlpool in the waters of River Ganga.

Shlok 16- 17: Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma assumed a terrific form. Hanuma possessing a gigantic body 
and the son of wind-god, uprooting a pillar with a hundred edges and decorated with gold in that edifice, 
then speedily whirled it around.

Shlok 18- 19: Fire was also generated there (due to friction with other pillars) The edifice was then 
consumed by fire. Seeing the edifice burning, that Hanuma killing those hundred demons, like Indra killing 
demons with his thunderbolt and gloriously staying in the sky, spoke (the following) words:

Shlok 20- 21: "Thousands of monkeys like me, possessing gigantic bodies of strength, were sent on the 
orders of Sugreeva. We and other monkeys are now roaming the entire earth."

Shlok 22: "Some of the monkeys are having a strength of ten elephants. Some are having a strength 
of a hundred elephants. Some are having a prowess equal to that of a thousand elephants."

Shlok 23: "Some are having the strength of a strong stream. Some have strength equal to that of 
wind. Some other army-chiefs of monkeys even cannot be measured."

Shlok 24: "Surrounded by hundreds, myriads, lakhs and crores of such monkeys having their teeth 
and nails as their weapons, Sugreeva, who is capable of destroying you all, will come."

Shlok 25: "You hold enmity with the high souled Rama. For this, the City of Lanka will not be there. 
Neither you, nor even Ravana will survive."

[Text] Ravana sends Jambumali, son of Prahasta, to capture Hanuma. Jambumali attacks Hanuma 
with his numerous arrows. Hanuma hurls a big rock towards Jambumali, but it fails to kill him. Then, 
Hanuma throws a big sal tree towards Jambumali and the latter succumbs to it.

Shlok 1- 2- 3: Jambumali, the demon with great tusks, wielding a bow, donning crimson garlands and clothes, 
wearing beautiful chaplet and charming ear-rings, possessing a gigantic body, having round and open 
eyes, the demon causing diseases, unconquerable in battle, a strong demon and the son of Prahasta, commanded 
by Ravana, started stretching with rashness his big bow resembling a rain bow garnished splendorous 
arrows and which brilliance was similar to that of a lightening and produced a sound like that of a 
thunder.

Shlok 4: The tumultuous sound created out of the twanging of that bow, soon filled up the quarters, 
intermediate points and the sky.

Shlok 5: Seeing him, arriving by a chariot yoked with donkeys, that Hanuma who was endowed with 
swiftness, was thrilled with joy and made a noise too.

Shlok 6: The long-armed Jambumali transfixed sharp arrows into that great monkey, Hanuma who was 
standing on the top of the archy door-way.

Shlok 7: He transfixed Hanuma the leader of monkeys in the face with an arrow with a crescent-shaped 
head, on the head with an arrow having an ear-shaped top and in the arms with ten steel arrows.

Shlok 8: That crimson face of Hanuma, hit by an arrow, shone like a full-blown lotus touched by 
a sun's ray in autumn.

Shlok 9: That face of Hanuma, which was naturally crimson in colour, smeared with blood, beamed 
like a large lotus in the sky sprinkled with drops of sandal.

Shlok 10: Hanuma, struck by those arrows, was enraged with that demon and then saw by his side, 
a big rock of a very large measure.

Shlok 11: Uplifting that rock with strength, the athletic Hanuma hurled it with force. The enraged 
demon then struck back that rock with ten arrows.

Shlok 12: Seeing that work in vain, the powerful Hanuma of terrific prowess, uprooted a very large 
sal tree and whirled it around.

Shlok 13: Seeing the mighty Hanuma, whirling around the sal tree, the exceedingly strong Jambumali 
discharged numerous arrows.

Shlok 14: He splitted sal tree with four arrows and struck the arms of Hanuma with five arrows, 
in the chest with one arrow and in the space between the breast wit ten arrows.

Shlok 15: Hanuma, with his body full of arrows, was highly enraged and taking the same iron rod 
as well as clasping it swiftly, whirled it around.

Shlok 16: Spinning the iron rod with a great speed, Hanuma, richly endowed with strength and highly 
agitated, threw it on the broad chest of Jamubumali.

Shlok 17: That Jambumali's head was not there, nor his arms, nor his knees, nor his bow, nor his 
chariot and nor his horses were seen nor his arrows.

Shlok 18: Thus struck by Hanuma, the mighty Jambumali, with his limbs and ornaments crushed to 
powder, was instantly killed and fell dead on the ground.

Shlok 19: Hearing Jambumali having been killed, as also the mighty Kimkaras, Ravana was angry with 
his red enraged eyes.

Shlok 20: Since the mighty son of Prahasta was killed, that Ravana rolling his red eyes with rage, 
immediately ordered the sons of ministers possessing high strength and prowess, to go to the battle.



SARGA 45
------------------------------

[Text] The seven sons of Prahasta surrounded by a great army rush in speedy chariots upon Hanuma, 
who is standing on the archy gate way. They discharge a shower of arrows on Hanuma. Then, Hanuma crushes 
all the enemies, using his palms, feet, fists, nails, chest and thighs only as his weapons. After killing 
those demons, Hanuma climbs up the archy door-way and takes up his position there again.

Shlok 1- 2- 3- 4: Thereafter, those seven sons of his chief minister having a lustre similar to that of 
fire, surrounded by a great army, wielding their respective bows, possessing a great strength, well-trained 
in archery and the best among knower of weapons, wishing a victory reciprocally, having an immense prowess 
each, and as directed by Ravana, started highly delighted from that palace, in great chariots yoked 
with horses. Those chariots were having a noise similar to that of an autumnal cloud, overlaid with 
a protective armour of gold, surmounted by banners and decorated with smaller flags. They were stretching 
their bows inlaid with refined gold and looking colourful like clouds accompanied by flashes of lightning.

Shlok 5: Coming to know that Kimkaras themselves were killed their mothers together with their 
relatives and friends were tormented with grief.

Shlok 6: Those sons of chief minister, wearing ornaments made of pure gold, rushed towards Hanuma, 
who was ready for battle and who stood on the archy gate-way motionless.

Shlok 7: Those demons looking like clouds, diffusing thunder-like sounds of their chariots and 
discharging a shower of arrows, moved in different directions resembling rainy clouds in the monsoon.

Shlok 8: Thus covered by those showers of arrows, Hanuma became invisible even as a mountain-king 
is concealed by incessant showers.

Shlok 9: Roaming about in a cloudless sky, that fast-footed monkey made the arrows and the speedy 
chariots of those virile demons, useless.

Shlok 10: Playing with those demons wielding a bow each in the sky, that hero shone like the Lord 
of Wind, playing with clouds brandishing a rain bow.

Shlok 11: Making a terrific roar and frightening that great army, the valiant Hanuma rushed on 
those demons.

Shlok 12: That Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies, struck some with his palms, some with his feet 
and some others with his fists. He tore down some others with his nails.

Shlok 13: Hanuma crushed some with his chest and some others with his thighs. Some fell down there 
itself on the ground, just by the roar made by Hanuma.

Shlok 14: Seeing those demons dying and falling on the ground, all the remaining army, afflicted 
with fear, fled in ten different directions.

Shlok 15: Their elephants trumpeted with a wrong accent. Horses fell down on the ground. Even the 
earth was filled with chariots which had their seats, banners and canopies broken.

Shlok 16: Thereafter, streams flowing with blood were seen on the way. Lanka resounded with various 
kinds of horrible voices.

Shlok 17: That heroic and mighty Hanuma having a terrible prowess, killing those arrogant demons 
and being desirous of a combat with the other demons, again reached that archy door way itself.



SARGA 46
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana sends Virupaksha, Yupaksha, Durdhara, Praghasa and Bhasakarna the five foremost 
army-generals so as to capture Hanuma. Ravana explains his guess, saying to those five generals that 
Hanuma may not be an ordinary monkey, but an evil spirit created by Indra the Lord of celestials and 
asks them to exert a great effort to capture him. Hanuma first kills Durdhara who initially attacks 
him. He then kills Virupaksha and Yupaksha, by attacking them with a sala tree. Hanuma later kills Praghasa 
and Bhasakarna, by hurling the top of a mountain on them. After destroying the remaining army together 
with horses elephants and chariots, he again in returns to the archy door way of the Ashoka groove.

Shlok 1: Coming to know that the chief minister's sons were killed by the high souled who had 
cleverly concealed the expression made an excellent thought.

Shlok 2- 3: That Ravana ordered (as follows) five foremost leaders of the army viz. Virupaksha, Yupaksha, 
Durdhara the demon, Praghasa and Bhasakarna, all of them brave demons, skilled in strategy, eager to 
capture Hanuma and equal to the speed of wind in battle.

Shlok 4: He ordered as follows: "March, all of you O generals, taking a large army together that 
mokey be punished."

Shlok 5: "Approaching that monkey, you ought to become diligent. Action should be taken by you 
which is not out of accord with time and space."

Shlok 6: "Judging him by his actions, I do not think him as a mere monkey. By all means, he may 
be an evil spirit, putting on an extraordinary might."

Shlok 7- 8- 9: "This evil spirit may be some being evolved for our sake by Indra the Lord of celestials 
with a strength of his askesis. Celestials, demons, sages along with Nagas the serpent-demons, Yakshas 
the spirits and Gandharvas the celestials musicians were conquered by my along with you all together. 
Even same offensive surely, will be effected to us by them. It is such an evil spirit created by Indra. 
There is no doubt about it. Let it be captured forcibly. This monkey of a great prowess should not be 
despised by you."

Shlok 10- 11: "Earlier, I saw the monkeys of a great prowess like Vali and Sugreeva, the mighty Jambavan, 
Nila the Chief of army and so on like Dvivida. their scheme of performance is not so fearful as this; 
nor their efficacy, nor their prowess, nor their intellect, nor this capacity to change their form or 
energy at will."

Shlok 12: "Keeping in view that it is a great evil spirit standing in the form of a monkey, exert 
a great effort and capture it."

Shlok 13: "The three worlds including Indra, celestials, demons and humans are not fit to stand 
before you in the battle-field."

Shlok 14: "Even then, the one who is skilled in strategy, desirous of a victory in a battle is 
to protect himself. Victory in a battle is indeed unreliable."

Shlok 15- 16: All of them, having a great strength and a blaze equal to that of fire, accepting the 
orders of their king and augmenting their strength with chariots, elephants in rut, horses of extra 
ordinary swiftness and various kinds of sharp weapons, sallied forth with a great speed.

Shlok 17- 18: Thereafter, those valiant demons saw that Hanuma the great monkey, encircled by his rays 
of splendour like a rising sun, shining, standing on the archy door-way, possessing enormous energy, 
strong mental disposition and colossal strength.

Shlok 19: Immediately on seeing that Hanuma of great intellect, of great swiftness and of a gigantic 
body, all those demons, stationed in all quarters, attacked him with their terrific weapons from every 
side.

Shlok 20: Durdhara discharged five sharp and fierce steel arrows with a lustre of black lily-petals 
and yellow tops to descend into Hanuma's head.

Shlok 21: Pierced in the head by those fire arrows, Hanuma leapt roaring in the sky, making the 
roar reverberating in all directions.

Shlok 22: Then the mighty and the valiant Durdhara leapt into the sky with his chariot. Stretching 
his bow and throwing hundreds of sharp arrows, he attacked Hanuma.

Shlok 23: Hanuma warded him off from showering the arrows on him in the sky, as the wind wards 
off a rainy cloud from raining at the end of a monsoon.

Shlok 24: Thus afflicted by that Durdhara, Hanuma then emitted a roar once again and swiftly expanded 
his body.

Shlok 25: Like a mass of lightning on a mountain, Hanuma instantaneously fell on Durdhara's chariot, 
by jumping up from far above with great speed.

Shlok 26: Losing his chariot whose axle and pole had been broken and all his eight horses destroyed, 
Durdhara then dropped down, losing his life, to the ground.

Shlok 27: Engrossed in anger to see his fallen on the ground, the inviolable virupaksha and Yupaksha, 
the annihilators of enemies, jumped up into the air.

Shlok 28: Jumping up in the air all of a sudden those two demons struck in the chest with their 
clubs that long-armed Hanuma standing in clear sky.

Shlok 29: Striking down the swiftness of those violent demons, the mighty Hanuma whose prowess 
is equal to that of Garuda the eagle, again descended on to the ground.

Shlok 30: Approaching a sala tree and uprooting it, that Hanuma the monkey killed those two valiant 
demons.

Shlok 31- 32: Getting to know all those mighty three killed by Hanuma, Praghasa with a great alacrity, 
forcefully attacked Hanuma. The valiant Bhasakarna, highly enraged, attacked taking a spear in his hand.

Shlok 33: The two generals stood by the side of the illustrious Hanuma. Praghasa pierced Hanuma 
with a sharp-pointed spear and Bhasakarna attacked him with a dart.

Shlok 34: With his limbs wounded by those two demons, that Hanuma with his body-hair anointed by 
blood, became enraged, with his blaze similar to that of a rising sun.

Shlok 35: Having plucked up the top of a mountain with its various animals serpents and trees, 
the heroic Hanuma the best among monkeys, killed those two demons.

Shlok 36: When those five army-generals have been killed, Hanuma then destroyed that remaining 
army.

Shlok 37: Like Indra the thousand-eyed god destroying the demons, Hanuma destroyed the horses by 
striking them with horses, the elephants with elephants, the warriors with warriors and the chariots 
with chariots.

Shlok 38: The earth had its path-ways blocked on all sides with the elephants and the horses killed, 
with the demons killed and with the big chariots which had their axles broken.

Shlok 39: Like Yama the Time-spirit waiting for the right moment for the destruction of the mortals, 
the heroic Hanuma, killing the eminent demons and the army-generals with their troops and vehicles in 
the combat, waited for the right moment at the arch-way.



SARGA 47
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana sends Aksha, his own son, to fight against Hanuma. Aksha, along with his army 
elephants and horses, approach Hanuma and incites him to battle by discharging three sharp arrows. As 
Aksha discharges his arrows, Hanuma bounces quickly to the sky and smashes Aksha, his chariot and the 
horses with blows. After killing Aksha, Hanuma returns again to the same archy door-way.

Shlok 1: Hearing and sustaining that the five army-generals along with their followers and vehicles 
were disposed off by Hanuma, Ravana looked at Aksha, his son, violent in combat and who was inclined 
to fighting as well as sitting in front of him.

Shlok 2: Goaded by the looks of Ravana, the energetic Aksha, wielding a golden dotted bow, quickly 
sprang up, like a fire switched up by the foremost of brahmins in a sacrificial fire, by offering oblations 
to it.

Shlok 3: Mounting a great chariot, having a splendour of a newly risen sun and overlaid with a 
protective armour of highly refined gold, that valiant cheif of demons sallied forth towards that mighty 
monkey.

Shlok 4: Aksha's chariot was earned through many kinds of his penances. It was shining with a 
protective armour of highly refined gold, adorned with a flag on a flag-staff studded with gems and 
yoked well with eight excellent horses, having speed equal to that of a mind.

Shlok 5: That chariot was unassailable by celestials or demons. It moved without hindrance to 
any place. It shone like a sun and could move within the sky. It was well-conceived with a quiver, eight 
swords and tied with bells. It was orderly arranged with spears and lances in their respective places.

Shlok 6: Then, Aksha having a prowess equal to that of celestials, came forth, mounting that chariot 
decorated with golden wreaths, having a brilliance of moon and sun, filled with every right thing and 
shining like rays of sun.

Shlok 7: Aksha, filling the sky earth and its mountains with sounds of horses elephants and chariots, 
together with his army, approached the efficient Hanuma the great monkey, standing at the archy door-way.

Shlok 8: Approaching that Hanuma, standing there readily to destroy mortals, similar to a fire 
that is to destroy the world, the yellow-eyed Aksha was bewildered, born of a surprise and looked to 
him with a great esteem.

Shlok 9: That Aksha, the mighty prince, assessing the swiftness of that high-souled Hanuma and 
his prowess with regard to his adversaries as also his own strength, increased his body more and more 
like the sun when the frost is faded away.

Shlok 10: Understanding Hanuma's prowess to be unrestrainable and stable in battle, that Aksha, 
exhibiting anger initially, became stable and mentally composed and incited Hanuma to battle by discharging 
three sharp arrows towards him.

Shlok 11: Recognizing that Hanuma, as a haughty monkey, after having gallantly conquered his adversaries 
and accustomed to fatigue, that Aksha, graspign the bow and arrows his hand, saw him with an excited 
mind.

Shlok 12: Having a glden chain, a pair of armlets and charming ear-rings, Aksha of a swift prowess, 
approached Hanuma. Their unmatched get-together in combat became a baffle to even the celestials and 
demons.

Shlok 13: Seeing that battle between Hanuma and Aksha, the earth uproared. The sun did not shine 
brightly. The wind ceased to blow. The mountain shook. The sky made a reverberant sound. The ocean too 
was agitated.

Shlok 14: Then, that eminent demon, who correctly knew how to fix his gaze on the target, to fit 
an arrow to the bow and to discharge it, hurled on Hanuma's head, three arrows which were well-painted, 
having golden shafts and feathers and which resembled venomous serpants.

Shlok 15: Oozing the blood from his wound caused by those arrows descended into his head (by Aksha), 
looking like the newly risen sun, his eyes bathed in blood rolling rapidly, Hanuma shone brightly like 
the sun surrounded by a circle of rays, having the arrows as its rays.

Shlok 16: Seeing in the battle that Aksha the prince, with his marvellous weapons and picturesque 
bow, that Hanuma the excellent one among Sugree's counsellors, was rejoiced and with an inclination 
to fight, grew in size.

Shlok 17: That Hanuma, endowed with strength and prowess, resembling the sun appearing on a peak 
of Mandara muntain and whose anger was increased, then burnt the prince Aksha along with his army and 
vehicles, by the rays of fire emnating from his eyes.

Shlok 18: That demon in the form of a cloud, raining down arrows, then wielding a bow in the form 
of a rain-bow, soon discharged arrows on Hanuma standing in the form of a mountain, like a cloud showering 
rain on a high mountain.

Shlok 19: Seeing that Aksha the prince, possessing an impetuous valour, endowed with enhanced splendour 
strength and vigour with a capacity to move within the sky like a cloud, coming to the battle, Hanuma 
roared with joy.

Shlok 20: Boastful of his valour in battle because of his childish attitude, Aksha wit an enhanced 
fury and red-blood eyes, approached Hanuma who was incomparable in battle, as an elephant approaching 
a well covered with heaps of straw.

Shlok 21: As Aksha forcefully discharged his arrows, Hanuma roared a sound of thunder and bounced 
quickly to the sky assuming a terrible sight, stretching out his arms and thighs.

Shlok 22: That strong and valiant Aksha, the foremost among the demons, and the best among car 
warriors, went chasing Hanuma who was flying upwards, difusing arrows like a cloud showering hail-stones 
on a mountian.

Shlok 23: That valiant Hanuma, whose swiftness was equal to the mind and possessing impetuous valour 
in battle, rushing forth like wind in the space between one arrow and another and thus escaping Aksha's 
arrows, moved in the path visited by wind (the sky).

Shlok 24: With a respectful faculty of sight, Hanuma saw that Aksha who was wielding his bow and 
readily inclined to fight, covering the entire sky with excellent arrows with various types of tops 
and became thoughful.

Shlok 25: Then, the mighty armed Hanuma, who knew how to act under particular circumstances, roaring 
when pierced in the breast with shafts by the high souled heroic, Aksha, reflected on the prowess of 
his adversary in battle.

Shlok 26: "The mighty Aksha, possessing the lustre of a rising sun, is performing a great act, 
as a mature youth. My mind is not conceding here to kill him, who is distinguished in all acts of war-fare."

Shlok 27: "He possesses a great intellect and is also prominent by his valour. He is well-composed 
and highly tolerant in battle. Due to his eminent deeds and virtues, he is undoubtedly adored by saints, 
Nagas the serpent-demons and Yakshas the semi-dviine being."

Shlok 28: "He is standing very much before me and looks me straight in the eyes, reassured as he 
is, by his prowess and enthusiasm. His swift-moving prowess trembles even the minds of celestials and 
demons."

Shlok 29: 'If neglected, he would undoubtedly overpower me. His prowess is getting augmented in 
battle. The only option left out for me is to kill him now. It is not proper to neglect a spreadin fire."

Shlok 30: The valiant and te mighty Hanuma, reflecting thus about the swiftness of the adersary 
and determining his own couse of action, then acquired a course of action, then acquired a momentum 
and also made up his mind to kill him.

Shlok 31: That Hanuma, the heroic son of wind, killed using the blows of his palm, those eight 
horses posessing a great speed in the path of sky with alertness as also having a capacity to bear burden 
while turning to different directions.

Shlok 32: Then, the great chariot of Aksha, thus struck by the palm and subdued by Hanuma the counsellor 
of Sugreeva, had its interior broken, its carriage pole loosened and its horses dead and fallen from 
the sky to the ground.

Shlok 33: Leaving the chariot, wielding the bow and sword, that Aksha the chariot-warrior leapt 
to the sky. Having a terrible power of penance and leaving his body like a sage, he then was seen departing 
to heaven because of his Yogic penance.

Shlok 34: Thereafter, Hanuma with his prowess equal to that of wind, approaching Aksha moving in 
the sky, which is often frequented by Garuda the eagle, the wind and Siddhas the ascetics endowed with 
supernatural powers, slowly grasped his feet firmly.

Shlok 35: That Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of wind-god, his father, and the excellent 
one among monkeys, spigning round Aksha like grasping a great serpent an eagle for a thousand times 
in the battle, hurled him down to the floor rapidly.

Shlok 36: With his arms, thighs, hips and neck broken, blood dripping, his bones and eyes crushed, 
his joints displaced and his sinews shattered, that demon was killed by Hanuma.

Shlok 37: Hanuma, having crushed him on the ground, created a great fear to Ravana. Aksha, thus 
having been killed, Hanuma was gazed on with excessive astonishment by great sages who move everywhere 
without obstruction and having great voes as also by spirits Yakshas the semidivine beings, Pannagas 
the serpent-demons and by celestials with Indra the lord of celestials.

Shlok 38: Killing that Aksha, possessing a lustre equal to that of Jayanta the son of Indra the 
lord of celestials and having his eyes resembling blood, the heroic Hanuma reached the same archy door 
way again, like Yama the lord of death expecting in a moment any mortal getting destroyed by him.



SARGA 48
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana calls Indrajit and asks him to go for a battle against Hanuma. Indrajit wielding 
a colourful bow quickly in a chariot to face Hanuma in combat. The arrows discharged by Indrajit are 
made ineffective by Hanuma, through his peculiar skill of maneuvering them like a wind-god. Realizing 
that Hanuma cannot be slain, Indrajit merely takes him captive by discharging the unfailing missile 
presided over by Brahma, the creator. Hanuma falls on the ground motionless. The demons tie him with 
ropes and drag him to the presence of Ravana. Hanuma yields to their operation of capture, even though 
capable of aborting it, eager as he was to meet Ravana.

Shlok 1: Filled with anger on his son Aksha having been killed by Hanuma, yet reconciling his 
mind, the high-minded Ravana the king of demons for his part then instructed Indrajit (his eldest son) 
possessing the qualities of god (as follows):

Shlok 2: "You are well acquainted with mystic missiles. You are the foremost among those who are 
conversant with weapons. You cause anguish even to celestials and demons. Indra and other celestials 
perceived your performance with your missiles acquired by propitiating Brahma the creator."

Shlok 3: "Celestials together with troops of storm-gods joining Indra the lord of celestials were 
not able to endure the strength of your missiles in battle."

Shlok 4: "In a battle against you, every one in the three worlds gets exhausted. You are protected 
yourself by your great intellect and strong arms. You are guarded by your penance. You are aware of 
apportioning place and time properly."

Shlok 5: "There is nothing impossible for you in your acts of war. With your purposeful thinking, 
everything is possible for you. There is none in the three worlds, who does not know the force of missiles 
as also your (physical) strength."

Shlok 6: "The strength of your penance as also your prowess and strength in battle resemble mine. 
Admitting you in the squeeze of battle, my mind does not get fatigues because of the re-assurance."

Shlok 7: "All the Kimkaras, a demon called Jambumali, the heroic sons of ministers and the five 
chiefs of army have been killed, as also the army together with highly abundant number of horses, elephants 
and chariots."

Shlok 8: "Your beloved brother Aksha the prince also has been killed. O annihilator of enemies! 
The strength which is in me or in you, is indeed not there in them at all."

Shlok 9: "O intelligent one! Seeing the great strength, power and prowess of this monkey and keeping 
in view your own strength, exhibit your valour accordingly."

Shlok 10: "Keeping in view your own strength and of the army, O the foremost among those employing 
missiles, exert yourself in such a way, that further destruction of our army may stop, the moment you, 
whose enemies have died, have arrived near Hanuma."

Shlok 11: "O hero! The armies cannot protect you, even if they are in multitudes. There is no use 
taking a weapon like a strong thunder bolt against the monkey. There is no limit to the strength of 
Hanuma the son of wind-god. It is not possible to kill him, who resembles fire, by means of any weapon."

Shlok 12: "Perceiving well the fact in this way and with your mind composed by the thought that 
success can be achieved by your own effort, and remembering the strength of arrows of your wonderful 
bow, go and duly proceed with your work, without any hindrance."

Shlok 13: "This thought of my sending you is not indeed the best option. But, this decision is 
said to be according to the duties of a king and is the commendation of a warrior-class."

Shlok 14: "O destroyer of enemies! You have to learn surely the skill to employ various weapons 
in battle. You have to aspire for a victory too in battle."

Shlok 15: Hearing the words of his father, Indrajit the strong demon, possessing a power similar 
to that of gods, with an undepressed mind and with his intellect resolved to fight, performed a circumambulation 
in honour of Ravana the lord.

Shlok 16: Acclaimed by the beloved people of his own class, Indrajit who was violent in battle 
then entered the battle-field with an accomplished enthusiasm.

Shlok 17: Indrajit, the illustrious son of Ravana, having eyes like lotus-petals and endowed with 
extra ordinary energy, rushed forth like an ocean on full-moon days.

Shlok 18: That Indrajit, alike Indra the lord of celestials, ascended a chariot with unchecked 
speed and yoked with four sharp-toothed tigers, having their swiftness similar to Garuda the king of 
eagles.

Shlok 19: That Indrajit, the chariot-warrior, best among the wielders of bow, skilled in the use 
of weapons and excellent among those proficient in the use of missiles, went swiftly in his chariot 
to where Hanuma was.

Shlok 20: Hearing the rattling sound of Indrajit's chariot and a twang of his bow, the heroic Hanuma 
became more thrilled with delight.

Shlok 21: Indrajit, skilled in warfare, taking a very big bow with pointed arrows, went aiming 
towards Hanuma.

Shlok 22: While that Indrajit who was energetic in battle, was going ahead to the combat, with 
a bow in his hand, all the quarters became gloomy and ferocious animals howled in many ways.

Shlok 23: Nagas and Yakshas, great sages moving in astronomical circles, Siddhas and a multitude 
of birds going around the sky, gathered there and clamoured loudly with a great rejoice.

Shlok 24: Seeing Indrajit coming swiftly with the chariot, Hanuma made a noise with great resonance 
and grew up his body speedily.

Shlok 25: Ascending on his wonderful chariot and wielding a colourful bow, Indrajit on his part, 
stretched his bow, which made a glaring sound like that accompanying a stroke lightning.

Shlok 26: Those two warriors, Hanuma and Indrajit, possessing great velocity and a great strength 
as also fearless in combat, confronted in the battle like Indra the Lord of celestials and Ravana the 
Lord of demons who tightened hostility with each other.

Shlok 27: Hanuma, of immeasurable strength, having expanded his body, aborted the swiftness of 
arrows of that Indrajit, the great chariot-warrior, the wielder of a bow and well-renowned in battle. 
Hanuma wheeled about in the path of wind-god, his father.

Shlok 28: Then, the heroic Indrajit, the destroyer of strong enemies, discharged long and sharp-pointed 
arrows, having beautiful feathers, provided with picturesque golden shafts, with good inclination and 
as swift as lightning.

Shlok 29: Hearing the rattling sound of the chariot and the sound of wooden tomtoms, kettledrums 
and war-drums as also the sound of the bow-string being plucked, Hanuma sprang up again.

Shlok 30: Making the total target of Indrajit who was skilled in hitting his target useless, Hanuma 
the great monkey swiftly wheeled about between the arrows.

Shlok 31: Hanuma, the son of wind-god, again stayed in front of his arrows and stretching out his 
hands, sprang up.

Shlok 32: Those two warriors, full of swiftness and skilled in their war-fare, staged an excellent 
battle, which captivated the minds of all beings.

Shlok 33: Indrajit could not know the weakness of Hanuma, nor did Hanuma know the weakness of high-minded 
Indrajit. Those two warriors, who were equal in prowess to gods, coming into collision with each other, 
became unbearable to each other.

Shlok 34: The aim of his arrows getting aborted and even his unfailing arrows falling down, the 
high-minded Indrajit, who was well-known for hitting his target, got hold of a great thought.

Shlok 35: Keeping in view of that monkey being incapable of being slain, Indrajit, Ravana's son 
then formed an idea as to how to resort to capture of that Hanuma the chief of monkey-warriors.

Shlok 36: That warrior, Indrajit, excellent among the knowers of missiles and possessing a great 
splendor, then fitted to his bow, a missile presided over by Brahma the creator.

Shlok 37: Indrajit, who knows the true nature of missiles, feeling certain that he was incapable 
of being killed, bound that Hanuma, the son of wind-god, by that presided over by Brahma the creator.

Shlok 38: Fastened with the weapon discharged by the demon, Hanuma became motionless and fell down 
on the ground.

Shlok 39: Realizing that he had been bound by a missile presided over by Brahma the Lord of creation 
that Hanuma failing to keep his swiftness, considered it to be a favour of Brahma the creator done to 
him.

Shlok 40: Knowing it to be a missile presided over by Brahma the creator and consecrated by spells 
sacred to Brahma, the creator, Hanuma then recollected a boon got by Lord Brahma, the grand father of 
the entire creation.

Shlok 41: "I have no capacity to liberate from the bondage of the missile due to the power of Brahma 
the father of the world. Thus knowing the bondage, through the missile presided over by Brahma the self-born 
creator imposed by the enemy, it must be obeyed by me."

Shlok 42: Thinking of the potency of the missile and the grace of Brahma, the grandfather of the 
entire creation enjoyed by him, and thinking about his capacity to liberate from it (which was going 
to alight on him after a while) that Hanuma obeyed the command of Brahma the grand father of the entire 
creation.

Shlok 43: "Since I am being protected by Brahma, Indra and the wind-god, I do not have fear, eventhough 
I am fastened by the missile."

Shlok 44: "Even if I were captured by the demons, a great advantage is foreseen. There will be 
a dialogue with Ravana. Therefore, let the enemies capture me."

Shlok 45: That Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies and who acted after fully considering the pros 
and cons, ascertained his objective and stayed motionless. Approached and captured forcibly by the enemies 
as also frightened by them, he made a loud scream.

Shlok 46: Seeing that Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies falling motionless, the demons then tied 
him with plaited chords of hemp and bark of trees.

Shlok 47: Hanuma approved of being forcibly bound and reviled by the enemies, with an assured feeling 
that Ravana was curious as he was, to see him.

Shlok 48: That powerful Hanuma, tied with those chords of hemp and bark, was relieved of the missile, 
since the bondage of that missile does not indeed coexist with another bondage.

Shlok 49: Conceiving that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, bound with the bark of trees, 
as having been relieved of the missile, the heroic Indrajit, on his part, then became thoughtful as 
follows: "A person tied with other means cannot indeed be bound again by the missile."

Shlok 50: "Alas! My great exploit has been rendered futile. The scope of the mystic formula has 
not been considered by the demons. Once the spell has been made ineffective, another missile cannot 
be operative. All of us became jeopardized."

Shlok 51: Hanuma, liberated from the missile being dragged away by the demons and afflicted by 
the ties of ropes, could not realize that he was liberated from the missile.

Shlok 52: That Hanuma, then being beaten with sticks and fists by the cruel demons, was dragged 
to the vicinity of Ravana.

Shlok 53: Then, recognizing that Hanuma, tied with barks of trees and ropes, but liberated by the 
missile, Indrajit slowed that mighty Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys, to Ravana there sitting along 
with a body of his attendants.

Shlok 54: The demons showed to Ravana, the king of demons that captured Hanuma, the jewel among 
the foremost of monkeys who looked like an elephant in rut.

Shlok 55: So went round the following conversations from the heroic demons there: "Who is this 
being? Whose savant is he? Where has he come from? What is his pursuit? Who is his alley?"

Shlok 56: Thereafter, some demons, highly enraged, said to one another as follows: "Let this monkey 
be killed, even roasted alive and devoured."

Shlok 57: After crossing over the path swiftly, the high-souled Hanuma saw there the palace of 
Ravana, decorated with highly precious stones and his elderly attendants sitting at the feet of Ravana.

Shlok 58: That Ravana, who was endowed with an extraordinary energy, saw Hanuma the foremost of 
monkeys, being dragged hither and thither by demons of ugly countenance.

Shlok 59: Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys also saw Ravana the king of demons, charged with luster 
and strength and blazing like the sun.

Shlok 60: That Ravana, rolling his red-hot eyes with rage by seeing that Hanuma and thereafter 
seeing his important ministers who were elder to his by clan and character sitting there, ordered them 
to interrogate Hanuma.

Shlok 61: Questioned, as per order, by those ministers as to the purpose of his operation and the 
motive of his act, that Hanuma at the outset informed, "I came from Sugreeva as an envoy."



SARGA 49
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma sees well-adorned Ravana, who is seated on a well-decorated throne of crystal. 
He is surrounded by four ministers viz., Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva and Nikumbha. Surprised to 
behold the splendor and glory of Ravana, Hanuma believes that he could even rule heaven along with Indra, 
but for his gross unrighteousness, which pulled him down.

Shlok 1: Then, Hanuma with a terrific prowess, was enraged (at his capture and his being dragged) 
and saw Ravana with his red hot eyes. He was surprised by that deed of Indrajit.

Shlok 2: Ravana was endowed with a great splendor and shone with a glittering and precious diadem 
of gold as also encircled with strings of pearls.

Shlok 3: That Ravana was adorned with bright-coloured gold ornaments, inlaid with diamonds and 
decorated with worthy gems, which appeared as though they were prepared with the mind.

Shlok 4: Ravana was attired in very costly silk and his body was smeared with red-sandal paste 
and well painted with various brightly coloured designs.

Shlok 5- 6: Ravana looked strange with his ten heads, having terrible-looking yet good-looking pair 
of red eyes each, with brilliant sharp enormous teeth and protruding lips, like a daring demon endowed 
with extra ordinary vigour, shining brightly as Mount Mandara with its peaks and infested with snakes 
of different varieties.

Shlok 7: Ravana was having a pearl necklace casting its splendor on his bosom. He was looking 
like a mass of blue antimony, but with his countenance shining like the full moon and appearing like 
a cloud illumined by the rising sun.

Shlok 8: Ravana was distinguished by (twenty) arms, adorned with bracelets, smeared with excellent 
sandal-paste and decked with shining Angadas another variety of bracelets and looking like large five-hooded 
serpents.

Shlok 9: He was comfortably seated on a big excellent throne of crystal, rendered picturesque 
by being embedded with jewels and overspread with an exquisite covering.

Shlok 10: He was duly waited upon at close quarters on all sides by young ladies, well-adorned 
and with whisks in their hands.

Shlok 11- 12: He was proud of his might and had four counselors sitting nearby, all belonging to the 
demonical race and who knew the secret of good counsel, viz. Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva the demon 
and the counselor Nikumbha and looked like the entire terrestrial globe enclosed by four oceans.

Shlok 13: He was being reassured by counselors knowing the secret of good counsel and other demons 
with auspicious minds, as Indra the lord of celestials is reassured by celestials.

Shlok 14: Hanuma saw Ravana with a great splendor, sitting on the throne, looking like a rainy 
cloud on the peak of Mount Meru.

Shlok 15: Though tortured by the demons that Hanuma, of terrific prowess, experiencing a great 
surprise, looked attentively at Ravana.

Shlok 16: Seeing the glittering Ravana, the king of demons, Hanuma was bewildered by his splendor 
and thought in his mind as follows:

Shlok 17: "What figure, what courage, what strength, what splendor and what amalgam of auspicious 
marks, alas, this king of demons has!"

Shlok 18: "Had this lord of demons perhaps not strong in unrighteousness, he would have been a 
protector of even the world of celestials together with Indra the lord of celestials."

Shlok 19: "By his cruel and violent acts despised by the world, all people including gods and demons 
indeed remain frightened of him. If enraged he is indeed capable to turn the entire world into a single 
ocean."

Shlok 20: Seeing the power of Ravana the king of demons, who possessed an unlimited vigour, the 
intelligent Hanuma formulated many kinds of thoughts in this way.



SARGA 50
------------------------------

[Text] As instructed by Ravana, Prahasta his chief minister inquires of Hanuma as to who he 
was and also his motive in destroying the pleasure-garden as also killing the demons. In reply, Hanuma 
says that he destroyed the pleasure-garden in order that he might be taken captive and dragged to the 
presence of Ravana, whom he was eager to see and was forced in self-defense to kill those who stood 
in his way. Finally, he declares himself to be a messenger of Rama and adds that, though he was incapable 
of being bound by a missile presided over by Brahma, he surrendered to it only in order to see Ravana 
in person.

Shlok 1: That Ravana, the long-armed, who caused people to cry, looking up at that monkey standing 
in front of him, was affected with violent anger, having his mind seized with suspicion, speculated 
(as follows) about Hanuma, the jewel among the monkeys, who was invested with splendour.

Shlok 2- 3: "When Mount Kailasa was moved by me, is it the same Nandi the divine bull (attendant 
of Siva) which cursed me long ago and came here now in this form or whether he is Bana the great demon 
(son of Bali) came here in the form of a monkey."

Shlok 4: That king Ravana, becoming enraged with red hot eyes, spoke the following concise and 
meaningful words relevant to that occasion, to Prahasta, his chief of ministers.

Shlok 5: "Ask this wicked monkey from where did he come, for what reason did he come to this place 
and for what purpose did he frighten the female-demons in destroying our garden."

Shlok 6: "Ask this evil-minded monkey as to what really is his purpose in coming over to my invincible 
City and what pursuit he is doing this battle."

Shlok 7: Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta spoke the following words to Hanuma, "Take courage! 
Happiness to you! You need not get frightened, O monkey!"

Shlok 8: "O monkey! If Indra has sent you to the abode of Ravana, tell me the truth. Do not have 
fear. You will be released."

Shlok 9: "Are you, the one who has entered our city, assuming the guise of a spy, sent by Kubera 
the god of riches or by Yama the god of death or by Varuna the lord of the sea or whether sent by Vishnu 
the lord of preservation, as a messenger, longing for a victory?"

Shlok 10: "O monkey! Your form alone is that of a monkey. Your splendour indeed is not that of 
a monkey. Now, tell me the truth. Thereupon, you will be released."

Shlok 11: "If you tell a lie, your survival will be difficult. Or else, tell me the purpose of 
your entry into Ravana's abode."

Shlok 12- 13: Hearing the words of Prahasta, Hanuma spoke to Ravana the Lord of demons as follows, 
"I am not a messenger of Indra or Yama or Varuna. I have no friendship with Kubera the god of riches, 
nor am I instigated by Vishnu. This is just my form of existence, by my very birth. I am a monkey who 
came here."

Shlok 14: "The sight of Ravana the King of demons is difficult to be obtained. Intent on that object 
(of sight of Ravana), the garden was destroyed by me."

Shlok 15: "Then, those strong demons came with a desire to fight with me. Just for protecting my 
body, I had to attack them in battle."

Shlok 16: "I am incapable of being bound by missiles and nooses even by celestials and demons. 
This boon came to me also from Brahama only."

Shlok 17- 18: With a desire to see you the king, I surrendered to the missile. Soon after bound by 
the demons, I was indeed released from the missile. I came to your presence, prompted by some mission 
of Rama."

Shlok 19: "O, Lord of demons! Know me to be a messenger of Rama who is possessing I am unlimited 
splendour. I am telling you a beneficial word. Listen to it."



SARGA 51
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma narrates the story of Rama, who on command from his father, went on exile to Dandaka 
forest along with Seetha, who was later borne away by Ravana through the sky over Rishyamuka mountain. 
Hanuma adds that Rama, while searching for Seetha at Mount Rishyamuka, happened to meet Sugreeva and 
made friendship with him. Hanuma also tells the story about Rama installing Sugreeva in the throne, 
after killing Vali and about Sugreeva promising Rama to get Seetha searched. Celebrating the glory of 
Rama, Hanuma points out to Ravana that if he wished to survive he should give back Seetha to Rama and 
that he should be prepared for the worst if on the other hand he refuses to do so.

Shlok 1: Seeing that highly energetic Ravana, the courageous Hanuma coolly spoke to him the following 
meaningful words:

Shlok 2: "O king of demons! By the command of Sugreeva, I came here to your abode. Sugreeva, the 
Lord of monkeys, your brother, asked me to enquire about your welfare.

Shlok 3: "Hear the righteous and meaningful words, as a following advice, of the high-souled Sugreeva, 
your brother, conducive to good in the world as well as in the other world."

Shlok 4: "There was a king named Dasaratha, having chariots, elephants and horses, like a father 
to the people and endowed with a splendour equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials."

Shlok 5- 6: "His eldest son named Rama, having mighty arms, a bestower of affection and our lord, 
by the command of his father, abiding in a righteous path, went out on exile and entered a forest called 
Dandaka along with Lakshmana his brother and Seetha his wife."

Shlok 7: "Seetha, wife of Rama, devoted to her husband and daughter of the high-souled king, named 
Janaka, the head of Videha kingdom, got lost in the forest."

Shlok 8: "That prince, Rama together with his brother, searching that lady, reached Mount Rishyamuka 
and happened to meet Sugreeva."

Shlok 9: "While Sugreeva promised Rama to get Seetha searched, Rama too promised to get the kingdom 
of monkeys to Sugreeva."

Shlok 10: "Thereafter, killing Vali in a combat, Rama installed Sugreeva on the throne as a lord 
of that troop monkeys and bears."

Shlok 11: "You may indeed know Vali, the foremost among monkeys, previously. Rama killed that Vali 
with a single arrow in battle."

Shlok 12: "Sugreeva, the lord of monkeys, true to his promise, was intent on searching for Seetha 
and sent his monkeys to all directions."

Shlok 13: "Hundreds, thousands and lakhs of monkeys are searching for her in all quarters, as also 
below and above in the sky."

Shlok 14: "Among those monkeys, some mighty and virile monkeys are similar to Garuda the eagle. 
Some are like wind, swiftly going with an unhindered movement."

Shlok 15: "I am, however, an own son of wind-god and named as Hanuma. I came here even by crossing 
quickly the ocean, which is a hundred yojanas (or eight hundred miles) wide for the sake of Seetha and 
wishing to see her."

Shlok 16- 17: "While strolling around in the city of Lanka, I found Seetha in your abode. You know 
about religious merit and wealth. You performed and mastered the austerities. That is why, you ought 
not besiege the wife of another, O great intellectual!"

Shlok 18: "Intellectuals like you indeed are not engrossed in acts, which are antagonistic to righteousness, 
which are attended with many dangers and which even ruin the doer at the roots."

Shlok 19: "Who is capable even among celestials and demons, to withstand the arrows discharged 
by Lakshmana, in the wake of the fury of Rama?

Shlok 20: "O king! No one is known in the three worlds, who have gained happiness, by doing harm 
to Rama."

Shlok 21: "That is why, accede to my words, which are beneficial for all the three divisions of 
time (viz. the past, present and future), resulting in affluence and respectability as well. Let Seetha 
be restored to Rama."

Shlok 22: "I beheld Seetha, the princess. The audience of Seetha is difficult to be achieved and 
it is obtained here. It is for Rama there to decide his remaining task of future consequence."

Shlok 23: "Capturing Seetha, whom you do not recognize as a five-hooded female serpent in your 
abode, has been found by me in that manner, and wholly given over to sorrow."

Shlok 24: "She is incapable of being devoured with one's might even by celestials and demons, any 
more than food mixed with abundant poison could be digested with one's digestive power, if consumed."

Shlok 25: "It is not proper for you to lose your exceptional longevity and that fortune which is 
an outcome of your virtue, both of which have been acquired by you through the practice of austerities."

Shlok 26: "You may be thinking that you are immune from death from demons and celestials, because 
of your austerities. But your opinion in that matter is not correct, on account of the following reason.

Shlok 27: "This Sugreeva is indeed neither a god, nor Asura the chief of evil spirits nor a demon 
nor a child of Danu the demon, nor Gandharva the celestial musician nor Yaksha the semi-divine being 
nor pannaga the serpent-demon. O King! How do you protect your life from him?"

Shlok 28: "The fruit of righteousness does not exist together with the result of unrighteousness 
(eventhough he practices virtue). That consequence of unrighteousness alone follows him. Righteousness 
in abundance destroys unrighteousness."

Shlok 29: "You already obtained the fruit of virtue till now. There is no doubt about it. In no 
time, you will obtain the fruit of unrighteousness also."

Shlok 30: "Recognizing the killing of demons in the forest of Janasthana, about the killing of 
Vali and about the friendship between Rama and Sugreeva, realize your own interest."

Shlok 31: "I am indeed, even alone, undoubtedly, destroying Lanka, along with its horses, chariots 
and elephants. However, this is not in accordance with the resolution of Rama."

Shlok 32: "For, Rama, indeed, promised in the presence of troops of monkeys and bears, about the 
extermination of enemies, by whom Seetha was actually laid violent hands upon."

Shlok 33: "Even Indra the Lord of celestials, in person, cannot attain happiness if he does any 
harm to Rama. How much move to another person like you?"

Shlok 34: "Know her, whom you recognize as Seetha and who stays in your captivity, to be none else 
than Kalaratri (the goddess presiding over and responsible for dissolution), who can destroy the entire 
Lanka."

Shlok 35: "Therefore, have it enough of this noose of death, in the form of Seetha's personality, 
which has been placed by yourself around your neck. Think well of your safety."

Shlok 36: "See; (in the immediate future), this city of Lanka, burnt away by the effulgence of 
Seetha and the City too being scorched with its markets and main streets, afflicted by the wrath of 
Rama."

Shlok 37: "Do not lead to extermination your own friends, counsellors, kinsmen, brothers, sons, 
well-wishers, enjoyments, wives and Lanka."

Shlok 38: "O king of demons! Listen to my truthful words coming as it is from the lips of this 
servant of Rama, his messenger and particularly of this monkey."

Shlok 39: "The renowned Rama is capable of totally destroying all the worlds together with its 
five elements, along with its animate and inanimate things and also to create yet again all the worlds 
in like manner as before."

Shlok 40- 41- 42: "The renowned Rama, who is equal in prowess to Vishnu the lord of the preservation and 
among celestials, demons or the foremost of men, or among hordes of Yakshas the semi-divine beings or 
ogres or among all Vidyadharas, a king of super-natural beings or among Gandharvas the celestials musicians 
or among Uragas the semi-divine serpents or among Siddhas the holy personages having super-natural powers 
or among excellent Kinnaras the mythical beings with human figure and head of a horse or among all types 
of birds or among all living beings at all places and at all times."

Shlok 43: "After doing a great harm in this manner to Rama the lord of all worlds as well as the 
lion among kings, your survival will be difficult."

Shlok 44: "O king of demons! Either celestials or demons or Gandharvas the celestial musicians 
or Vidyadharas a king of super-natural beings or Nagas the semi-divine serpents or Yakshas the semi 
divine beings-all of them are not able to stand before Rama the lord of the three worlds."

Shlok 45: "Either Brahma the self-existing god with four faces or Rudra with three eyes and the 
destroyer of Tripura (the city built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth, by Maya for 
the demons and burnt by Shiva), or Mahendra the god of atmosphere and sky as also the lord of celestials 
would not be able to protect the one to be killed by Rama in battle."

Shlok 46: Hearing those unpleasant words endowed with extreme skillfulness and which were spoken 
without fear from Hanuma, that unequalled Ravana ordered for the killing of that Hanuma.



SARGA 52
------------------------------

[Text] Hearing the harsh words of Hanuma, Ravana orders him to be killed. Vibhishana, however, 
advises Ravana to desist from the dastardly act, pointing out that the killing of an envoy is forbiddenaccording 
to religious scriptures.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words of the high=souled Hanuma, Ravana duly excited with anger, ordered 
for the killing of Hanuma.

Shlok 2: While it was ordered by the evil-natured Ravana for the killing of Hanuma, Vibhishana 
did not agree to the killing of Hanuma, who was entrusted with the functions of a messenger.

Shlok 3: Seeing Ravana getting enraged and looking to that affair (of killing of an envoy) that 
has arisen, Vibhishana who was firm in accompanying any object, reflected upon an appropriate action 
to be done.

Shlok 4: Then, deciding about a right action, Vibhishna, who was silled in communication and a 
conqueror of enemies, spoke softly the following very meaningful and useful words to Ravana, his venerable 
borther.

Shlok 5: "O king of demons! Forgive and give up your anger. Be gracious and hear my words. Virtuous 
kings of excellence, knowing the distant and the near, do not cause killing of an envoy."

Shlok 6: "O hero! Killing of this monkey is against a royal virtue and any universal custom condemns 
it. Hence, it is improper for you also to do it."

Shlok 7: "You are indeed the knower of what is right. You are a person of gratitude. You are well-versed 
in royal virtues. You know both the distant and the near in beings. You know the highest truth."

Shlok 8: "If even learned persons like you are seized by anger, then the knowledge of scriptures 
is indeed just a labour in vain."

Shlok 9: "O king of demons! O annihilator of enemies, dangerous to be approached! Therefore, be 
graceful. After ascertaining about right and wrong, let appropriate punishment be ordered to the envoy."

Shlok 10: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana the lord of demons was greatly enraged and replied 
in the following words:

Shlok 11: "O Vibhishana, the annihilator of enemies! There is no sin, even if the sinners are killed. 
So, I shall kill this monkey, who performed sins."

Shlok 12: Hearing those words, rooted in unrighteousness, enveloped in a great anger and accepted 
by the dishonourable, Vibhishana the best among those who weer endowed with understanding, spoke the 
following words, comprising of the highest truth.

Shlok 13: "O king of demons! O lord of Lanka! Be gracious enough. Hear my words endowed with righteousness 
and significance. O king! Sages say that messengers should not be killed at all places and at all times."

Shlok 14: "There is no doubt that this enemy is arrogant. He has created an unlimited displeasure 
to us. But, sages do not talk about the killing of an envoy There are indeed severeal punishments, intended 
for an envoy."

Shlok 15: "Some of the punishments to an envoy are-deforming the limbs, striking with a whip, shaving 
the head and impressing marks on the body. Indeed, we have not heard at any time of killing a messenger."

Shlok 16: "How can a person like you, holding an intellect trained in religious merit and purpose 
and a right judgement on cause and effect, subject to anger? Wise people indeed contain their anger."

Shlok 17: "O hero! There is no one equal to you, who can discuss about the law or duty, none about 
universal custom and none in capturing the essence of scriptures. You are indeed excellent among all 
the celestials and demons in these matter."

Shlok 18: "O king of demons! You are valiant. You are heroic. Even celestials and demons cannot 
conquer you. You conquered a multitude of proud celestials and demons together with their kings in battles 
several times"

Shlok 19: "I do not see any merit in killing this monkey. Let this carnal punishment be employed 
on those by whom this monkey was sent."

Shlok 20: "He is a person, sent by our enemies, whether he is good or bad. It is not worthy of 
killing him, who is an envoy, who is dependent on others and who talks for the cause of others."

Shlok 21: "O king! Moreover, If he is killed, I do not find any other person, who can travel through 
the sky and come here again to this shore of the great ocean."

Shlok 22: "O conqueror of enemies! Therefore, do not make efforts to kill him. On the other hand, 
you ought to strengthen such effort on celestials including indra."

Shlok 23: "O Ravana, who is fond of war! If he is dead, I do not find any other hero, who can incite 
those two arrogant princes, who are hindered by a long distance, for war."

Shlok 24: "O Ravana who can gladden the hearts of demons! It is not proper for you, who are difficult 
to be conquered by even celestials and demons having sufficient prowess energy and courage, to crush 
the arrival of a war."

Shlok 25: "There are more than a crore of valiant warriors in your charge, well-maintained, who 
desire your welfare, quite devoted, having colossal merits, born in a good tribe, holding high spirits 
and excellent wielders of weapons."

Shlok 26: "Therefore, let some who follow your command, by talking a portion of your army, subjugate 
those two stupid princes, in order to make your power known to your adversaries."

Shlok 27: Ravana, the mighty and the eminent king of demons as also the lord of ogres and the adversary 
of the world of celestials, understood the cherished and excellent message of Vibhishana his brother 
with his due presence of mind."



SARGA 53
------------------------------

[Text] As ordered by Ravana, the demons wrap up old rags around Hanuma's tail, pour oil to it 
and burn it with fire. The demons tie Hanuma with ropes and conduct ihm to walk down the entire city, 
proclaining to the citizens of Lanka saying that Hanuma is a spy. The female-demons inform Seetha about 
the burning of Hanuma's tail and making him move around the city by demons. Then, Seetha starts praying 
the fire-god to do good to Hanuma. In response to her prayers, fire-god makes Hanuma feel cool with 
his burnign tail. Then, Hanuma approaches the city-gate of Lanka, takes an iron-rod from the arched 
door of the gate and kills all the security-guards there.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words, which were aprropriate for that place and time, spoken by that hih-souled 
Vibhishana, his brother, Ravana spoke the following words in reply:

Shlok 2: "You have spoken well indeed that killing of an envoy is forbidden. Another punishment 
other than killing needs be certainly meted out to him."

Shlok 3: "It is said that a tail is possibly a beloved ornament for the monkeys. Let his tail 
be burn immediately. Let him go with a burnt tail."

Shlok 4: "Let all his relatives together with his friends, kinsmen and amicable persons then see 
him miserably injured with his deformed limbs."

Shlok 5: Ravana ordered that let the monkey be carried around with his burning tail by the demons 
in the entire city around its cross-roads."

Shlok 6: Hearing those words of Ravana, the demons, hard-tempered with their wrath, wrapped, up 
old ragged clothes around Hanuma's tail.

Shlok 7: While his tail was being wrapped around with cotton tatters, Hanuma proliferating, soon 
after catching dry wood in forests.

Shlok 8: The demons sprinkled oil and set out fire on that tail. Then, Hanuma, with his face resembling 
a rising sun with his mind filled with anger and impatience and with his burning tail, threw those demons 
down.

Shlok 9: To see the burning tail of that Hanuma, the delighted demons together with their women, 
chldren and elders went there.

Shlok 10: Tied down again by the cruel demons, coming together, the heroic Hanuma the foremost 
among monkeys made up his mind appropriate for that occasion (as follows):

Shlok 11: "Though I have been tied down, those demons cannot do whatever they wish to do against 
me. Breaking the ties, I can fly up and kill them."

Shlok 12: "If these evil-minded demons fasten me who is acting for the good of Rama my lord, because 
of the command by their lord, no rebuff has been done to me."

Shlok 13- 14: "I am adequate enough to kill all these demons in battle. But, for the delight of Rama, 
such city of Lanka is fit to be espionaged again. For this reason, I am putting up with it."

Shlok 15: "Lanka was not indeed observed well as to the particulars of specifications of the fort, 
when it was seen by me during the night. Surely, it is to be seen by me during the day-time."

Shlok 16: "Let the demons tie me down of again and torment me as they wish, by burning my tail. 
There will be no travail to my mind."

Shlok 17: Then, those delighted demons went, seizing Hanuma, who concealed all types of his feelings, 
who was strong and foremost among monkeys.

Shlok 18: Sounding couches and kettle-drums and proclaining the acts of Hanuma like his damaging 
of the pleasure-garden, the demons performing terrible deeds, dragged Hanuma through out that city.

Shlok 19: Accompanied by demons, Hanuma the annihilator of enemies, went happily and roamed about 
in that great city of demons.

Shlok 20: Then, Hanuma saw some wonderful house some wrapped up plots of land and well parted cross 
ways.

Shlok 21: Hanuma, the son of wind-god, saw streets congested with dwellings, places where several 
roads meet, high-ways as also approach-roads, small inner apartments and palaces appearing in multitudes, 
like clouds.

Shlok 22: All the demons proclaimed in cross roads, four-pillared temples and in royal high-ways, 
saying that Hanuma was a spy.

Shlok 23: Women, children and old people came out from their respective dwellings, with an eagerness 
to see that Hanuma with his burning tail.

Shlok 24: While the tip of Hanuma's tail was being ignited by the demons there, those female-demons 
with monstrous eyes then informed that unpleasant matter to Seetha, the princess.

Shlok 25: "O Seetha! That monkey with a red face, who had a conversation with you, is being moved 
around in the city, with his ignited tail."

Shlok 26: Hearing that cruel news, which created as much sorrow as when she was carried away by 
Ravana, Seetha was tormented with grief and started to pay homage to the fire-god.

Shlok 27: Then, the large-eyed Seetha, wishing for the welfare of Hanuma, prayed the fire-god with 
her devoted self.

Shlok 28: "If I have done any service to my husband, if I have performed a penance and if I am 
a faithful wife, please be cool to Hanuma."

Shlok 29: "If the wise Rama has even a little of kindness to me and if I have still some good fortune 
remaining to my credit, please be cool to Hanuma."

Shlok 30: "If that virtuous Rama recognises me as one,, who is endowed with a good moral conduct 
and who is ardently desirous of meeting him, please be cool to Hanuma."

Shlok 31: "If the venerable Sugreeva, true to his promise, can make me traverse from this ocean 
of sorrow, please be cool to Hanuma."

Shlok 32: Then, the fire-god, as though informing the fawn-eyed Seetha about the well-being of 
Hanuma, shone brightly with sharp flames, undisteurbed and shooting out pointed flames towards the right.

Shlok 33: Even wind-god, the father of Hanuma, combined with the fire on Hanuma's tail, swept coolly 
like a snow-breeze, creating a solace to Seetha.

Shlok 34: While his tail was in flames, Hanuma was reflecting why the fire, which was blazing on 
all sides, was not burning him.

Shlok 35: "It is conspicuous with large flames. But it is not creating any paoin to me, as if a 
snow-ball is kept at the tip of my tail."

Shlok 36: "Or, while I was jumping over the ocean, a surprise-alliance was formed with Mount Mainaka 
and through the mountain, with the ocean, because of Rama's power. By this, the reason of the coolness 
is clear."

Shlok 37: "If such an eagerness was there in the mind of the sea and the wise Mount Mainaka for 
the cause of Rama; will not the fire-god show the same degree of eagerness in making its touch cold?"

Shlok 38: "The fire does not burn me, due to kindness of Seetha, powerfulness of Rama and friendlines 
of my father."

Shlok 39: That Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, reflected agian for a monment, jumped with 
swiftness and roared too.

Shlok 40: Then, the glorious Hanuma like a mountain-peak, approached the city-gate, which was looking 
high and stood secluded from the crowds of demons.

Shlok 41: That prudent Hanuma assumed the form of a mountain and immediately within a moment, assumed 
an exceedingly short form, thus becoming free from his tethers.

Shlok 42: The glorious Hanuma, having been free from his bonds, again assumed the form equal to 
a mountain and while looking around, found and iron rod belonging to the arched door-way.

Shlok 43: That long-armed Hanuma, again taking taht rod made of iron, killed all those guards.

Shlok 44: That Hanuma, having an impetuous valour in combat, destroying those demons and looking 
over Lanka, shone like the sun encircled with rays, with the wreath of flames blazing on his tail.



SARGA 54
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma, with his blazing tail comes out and flits over the horses in Lanka, making up 
his mind to set fire to the city of Lanka which is the only work let for him to do. Hanuma burns the 
entire city, barring the abode of Vibhishana. All the demons were frightened o seeing the blazing fire, 
consuming their city with its trees, houses and a host of living beings. Surprised to see the city burning, 
the celestials and musicians (Gandharvas) gain a great delight.

Shlok 1: Then, after fulfilling his heart's wish, Hanuma, looking over Lanka, thought about the 
remaining act to be done, with an augmented energy.

Shlok 2: "Which act indeed is remaing nowto be done by me here, that may further create anguish 
to these demons?"

Shlok 3: "I have demolished the garden. I have killed excellent demons. I destroyed a portion 
of the army. The demolition of the fort is still remaining."

Shlok 4: "When the fort gets destroyed, the task (of Rama's battle) will be devoid of fatigue. 
Even with a small effort in this task, the work will become fruitful."

Shlok 5: "It is justified to satisfy this blazing flame on my tail, by feeding it to the full, 
with these excellent houses (in the city of Lanka)."

Shlok 6: Then, Hanuma, with his burning tail, strolled over the house-tops of Lanka, like a cloud 
charged with lightning.

Shlok 7: Surveying the gardens and lofty palatial mansions, that Hanuma, without fear, passed 
from one house to another, of the demons.

Shlok 8- 9: Jumping down on Prahasta's house, the valiant Hanuma, with great swiftness, having strength 
equal to wind, scattering fire on it, jumped over from there, to another house belonging to Mahaparsva. 
Hanuma, with great swiftness, having strength equal to wind, scattering fire on it, jumped over from 
there, to another house belonging to Mahaparsva. Hanuma scattered a fire there resembling a flame of 
fire that is to destroy the world.

Shlok 10: That Hanuma, of great splendour, then leapt to the houses of Vajradamshtra, Shuka and 
Sarana, the intelligent.

Shlok 11- 12- 13- 14-15- 16: Leaving the house of Vibhishana, Hanuma of great splendour, went successively to the 
houses of Rashmiketu, Surya shatru, Hrasvakarna, Damshtra, Romasha the demon, Yuddhonmatta, Matta, Dhvajagreeva 
the demon, the terrific Vidyujjihva, Hastimukha, Karala, Pishacha, Shonitaaksha, Kumbhakarna, Makaraksha, 
Yajnashatru, Brahmashatru, Narantaka, Kumbha as also the evil-minded Nikumbha and burnt the houses.

Shlok 17: That Hanuma of great fame burnt away wealth in the mansions of the rich.

Shlok 18: Having passed over all the houses, the mighty and glorious Hanuma thereafter approached 
the house of Ravana the king of demons.

Shlok 19- 20: Thereafter, scattering a blazing fire located at the tip of his tail, on that principal 
house, decorated with various kinds of precious stones, resembling Mounts Meru and Mandara as also embellished 
with all good work, the valiant Hanuma roared like a cloud thundering at noon-time in a rainy season.

Shlok 21: In contact with the wind, the fire escalated with a great speed and intensity, blazing 
like a fire that is to destroy the world.

Shlok 22: The wind carried the blazing fire to other houses. In conjunction with the wind, the 
fire became very swift.

Shlok 23: Those large houses, with golden windows, embedded with pearls, gems and precious jewels 
were shattered to pieces.

Shlok 24: The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost 
their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying "Alas! The fire-god has come really 
in a form of this monkey!"

Shlok 25- 26: Some women crying and carrying their suckling's with their hair dishevelled, fell down 
from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from 
clouds in the sky.

Shlok 27: That Hanuma saw molten metals mixed with diamonds, corals, cat's eye-gems, pearls and 
silver, surging from every marvellous house.

Shlok 28: As the fire does not get satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma 
was not wearied in killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number 
of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap).

Shlok 29: Flames of fire glittered like Kimshuka flowers at some places, blossoms of Shalmali tree 
at some places and like saffron-flowers at some other places.

Shlok 30: The high souled Hanuma, the swift monkey scorched the city of Lanka, as Rudra scorched 
the city of Tripura.

Shlok 31: Then, the fire having a terrific prowess, diffused by the swift Hanuma, stretching out 
a circle of flames, blazed and rose up to the summit of the mountain on which the city of Lanka.

Shlok 32: That fire diffused on those buildings, together with the wind picked up a speed equal 
to that of a fire at the time of dissolution of the world. It grew taller, touching the sky with a smokeless 
splendour. Those flames of fire shot up, as inflamed by ghee

Shlok 33: The great fire persisted, surrounding the entire Lanka, having a good splendour equal 
to that of millions of suns and blazed like a broken-up hemi-sphere of the world, creating many sounds 
of a wide-spread thunderbolt.

Shlok 34: The fire with a fierce splendour there, extended fully to the sky, shooting flames like 
Kumshuka flowers. The clouds, bearing the colour of blue lotuses, shone as covered by smoke formed out 
of the extinguished fire.

Shlok 35: "He is not a monkey. He is either Indra the Lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt, 
or Yama the lord of death of water, or the wind-god or the fire seated in the third eye of Lord Shiva 
or the sun-god or Kubera the lord of riches or the moon-god. He may be Kala (the Time-spirit) himself."

Shlok 36: "Whether the rage of four-faced Brahma, the grand father of all and the creator of all 
has arrived here in the guise of a monkey, playing the role of a destroyer of demons?"

Shlok 37: "Or whether a supreme bright energy of Vishnu, the lord of maintenance of the Universe, 
unthinkable, unmanifest, infinite and pearless, arrived now, assuming the form of a monkey for the destruction 
of demons, by virtue of Her extraordinary power?"

Shlok 38: Thus spoke all those excellent troops of demons in multitude, gathering together there, 
on seeing that city scorched so soon, with its host of living beings, houses and trees.

Shlok 39: Then, Lanka having been scorched with its demons, horses, chariots, elephants, multitude 
of birds, animals and trees, cried pitiably with tumultuous noise.

Shlok 40: Making a very terrific noise with a dreadful sound, the demons cried in various ways 
as follows: "O my dear beloved son! O my beloved husband! O my friend! O my very auspicious life, filled 
with enjoyments!"

Shlok 41: That Lanka appeared as though afflicted by a curse, as defeated by a strong fury of Hanuma, 
enveloped by flames of fire, with its distinguished heroes killed and with its warriors in retreat.

Shlok 42: Hanuma, with his great mind, saw Lanka with its dazed, frightened and dejected demons, 
marked by blazing flames of fire and afflicted by the fury of Brahma the creator of the universe.

Shlok 43: After demolishing the garden which was full of excellent trees, killing great demons 
in battle and burning that city endowed with a series of excellent houses, Hanuma the monkey and the 
son of wind-god, stood at ease.

Shlok 44: Standing there on the wonderful flat summit of Mount Trikuta, Hanuma the foremost leader 
of the monkeys, having a garland of flames formed by his blazing tail, shone like the sun having a garland 
of rays.

Shlok 45: Killing those multitudes of demons, demolishing that garden endowed with several trees 
and scattering fire on the houses of demons, the high-souled Hanuma sought Rama with his mind.

Shlok 46: Then, all the multitude of celestials enlogised that Hanuma, the principal warrior of 
the monkeys, possessing great strength and swiftness similar to the wind, greatly intelligent and the 
most excellent.

Shlok 47: Demolishing the garden, killing the demons in battle, Hanuma of great splendour shone 
brightly, after burning the beautiful City of Lanka.

Shlok 48: Seeing that city of Lanka burnt there, celestials, saints and great sages along with 
celestial's musicians, got a colossal surprise.

Shlok 49: Seeing that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and a mighty monkey, all the created 
beings were frightened, thinking of him as a fire that is to destroy the world.

Shlok 50: There, all the celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Nagas the celestial 
serpents, Yakshas the spirits and all great living beings attained a great joy.



SARGA 55
------------------------------

[Text] Making out that the whole of Lanka is reduced to ashes and conjecturing that Seetha too 
thus might have lost her life, Hanuma begins to reproach himself for his unrestrained exhibition of 
anger. Hanuma regrets that if Seetha dies now in this fire of Lanka, Rama and his brothers on hearing 
that report will not survive. While reflecting thus, Hanuma sees some good omens and asserts himself 
that Seetha can survive from the harsh forces of fire by her virtues of penance and devotion to Rama. 
In the meantime, he hears of her safety from the lips of Charanas (celestial bards) and feels consoled. 
Hanuma makes up his mind to return only after seeing her again.

Shlok 1: Seeing the city of Lanka blazing, and frightened with its multitude of demons getting 
alarmed, Hanuma the monkey became thoughtful.

Shlok 2: A great anxiety entered his mind and there arose in him a feeling of self-contempt. He 
said to himself "What an admonitory act has bee done by me in burning Lanka."

Shlok 3: "As a burning fire is extinguished with water, blessed indeed are those great-souled 
men of excellence, who in their wisdom, restrain their elevated fury."

Shlok 4: "Which enraged man would not incur a sinful act? An enraged person may even kill his 
elders. An enraged person may insult virtuous men with harsh words."

Shlok 5: "An agitated person ever does not know which appropriate words are and which are forbidden 
words to be uttered. For enraged persons, there is neither an improper act nor ever an improper word 
to be spoken."

Shlok 6: "As a serpent casts off its slough, whoever casts aside an intense anger sprung up in 
him suddenly by virtue of his endurance, he verily is said to be an excellent man."

Shlok 7: "Shame be upon me, the greatest sinner with utter foolishness and impudence, who became 
a fire-brand without giving thought to that Seetha and became hurtful to my master."

Shlok 8: "If this whole Lanka for its part has been burnt, the worshipful Seetha too has surely 
been burnt. Thus, I have spolt the purpose of my lord inadvertently."

Shlok 9: "That purpose for which all this effort was taken, has been spoilt. At the time of burning 
the city, I have not saved Seetha indeed."

Shlok 10: "This task (of burning Lanka) has been fulfilled by me and it has been completed only 
with a small effort. Overpowered as I was with anger, the very root of that fulfillment has been destroyed 
by me. There is no doubt."

Shlok 11: "The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore, 
Seetha also must have been surely lost."

Shlok 12: "If this task has been spoiled due to my perverted intelligence, it is appropriate even 
for me, here and now itself, to give up my life."

Shlok 13: "Shall I jump into fire now or into the mouth of a submarine fire? Or shall I give up 
my body as a feed to the marine animals?"

Shlok 14: "By me who has ruined the entire task, how can I, even while remaining alive, see Sugreeva 
the Lord of monkeys or Rama and Lakshmana the best of men?"

Shlok 15: "Due to culpability of my anger, I have indeed shown this apishness that is famous for 
instability in the three worlds."

Shlok 16: "Let there be shame upon the passionate way of my thinking, which breeds helplessness 
and instability. fir, eventhough capable as I am, Seetha could not be saved by me due to my exciting 
passion of anger."

Shlok 17: "If Seetha dies, those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana will die. If their death occurs, 
Sugreeva along with his associates will also die."

Shlok 18: "How can the virtuous Bharata together with Shatrughna, who are affectionate to his brother, 
survive after hearing this news?"

Shlok 19: "When the virtuous Ikshvaku dynasty perishes, all the people will undoubtedly be tormented 
with anguish and affliction."

Shlok 20: "Therefore, I, the unfortunate being, deprived of the values of duty and interest, with 
my mind filled with culpability of anger, clearly became the destroyer of the world."

Shlok 21: While thinking thus, Hanuma clearly saw some omens, whose welcome-results had already 
been directly experienced by him and again thought (as follows);

Shlok 22: "Or else, Seetha the auspicious lady, who is completely charming of her limbs and protected 
by her own effulgence, does not get destroyed. Fire does not indeed destroy fire!"

Shlok 24: "If this fire with its burning nature is not igniting me, it is surely due to the power 
of Rama and the benevolence of Seetha."

Shlok 25: "How should that Seetha, who is a godhead for the three brothers (of Rama) starting with 
Bharata and who is dear to the heart of Rama perish?"

Shlok 26: "This fire, which spreads everywhere without any hindrance, is not burning my tail. How 
can it burn the venerable Seetha?"

Shlok 27: Hanuma then recalled with wonder the sight of Mount Mainaka (having gold in its cavities) 
in the midst of sea-water there.

Shlok 28: "That Seetha can even burn away the fire by her penance, true utterances and undivided 
devotion towards her husband. Fire does not ignite her."

Shlok 29: Hanuma, who was thus thinking there about the overpowering virtue of Seetha, happened 
to hear the words of the high-souled charanas (heavenly bards).

Shlok 30: "Alas! Hanuma, who hurled a very terrific fire into Ravana's house, has indeed done a 
difficult act."

Shlok 31: "The city of Lanka, full of demons their wives, children and elders running hither and 
thither, as also filled with an uproar of people, appears as if it weeping through its mountain-caves."

Shlok 32: "It is just so surprising a marvel to us that the entire City with its market-places, 
ramparts and arched door-ways, was burnt, but Seetha alone was not burnt."

Shlok 33: That Hanuma became delighted in his mind, by seeing the omens, with their apparent advantages 
in them and very high qualities of their origin as also the words of those sages.

Shlok 34: Then, Hanuma, having fulfilled his object of desire by learning that Seetha the princess 
remains uninjured, made up his mind to return only after seeing her personally yet again.



SARGA 56
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma again visits Ashoka garden and sees Seetha once more. He consoles Seetha that 
Rama along with his forces of monkeys and bears will come soon and after conquering the enemies in battle, 
will take her back. After bidding adieu to Seetha, he ascends Mount Arishta and enlarges his body making 
himself ready to leap across the ocean.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, having offered his salutation to Seetha, who was present at the foot of Ashoka 
tree, Hanuma spoke: "Thank heaven! I am seeing you uninjured here!"

Shlok 2: Then, beholding again and again, that Hanuma, who had made ready for his return journey, 
Seetha spoke the following words, filled with affection towards her husband.

Shlok 3: "O Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies! You are yourself surely sufficient single-handed 
completion of this task. Your elevated energy is creditable indeed.

Shlok 4: "But, it will be appropriate for Rama, who destroys the hostile forces, to take me with 
him, after routing Lanka with his arrows."

Shlok 5: "Therefore, you act in such a way that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, may exhibit 
prowess worthy of him."

Shlok 6: Hearing those humble, reasonable and meaningful words of Seetha, Hanuma spoke the following 
words in reply.

Shlok 7: "Rama, accompanied by the leaders of monkeys and bears, will come soon and after conquering 
the enemies in battle, will take away your grief."

Shlok 8: Hanuma, the son of wind-god, thus consoling Seetha and making up his mind to go, saluted 
Seetha with reverence.

Shlok 9: Thereafter, that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, and the annihilator of enemies, 
with an anxious desire to see his lord, ascended the Mount Arishta of excellence.

Shlok 10: That mountain was covered as it were with dark green rows of gardens inhabited by towery 
elephants with red spots on their skin and with its clouds hanging between its summits, as with an upper 
garment.

Shlok 11: By metals scattered here and there, looking like eyes drawing up the eye-lids, the mountain 
looked like being awakened, as it were, with love by the bright rays of the sun.

Shlok 12: The mountain looked resembling the one which has started reciting the scriptures clearly 
in the form of the deep sound of running streams of water, singing as it were at a high pitch, in the 
form of roaring sound of various cascades.

Shlok 13: The mountain stood as it were with uplifted arms in the form of very lofty deodars and 
which started crying loudly as it were, on all sides, in the form of the sound of its cascades.

Shlok 14: The mountain seemed to be trembling in the form of waving dark automnal groves, which 
was piping as it were, in the form of hollow bamboos shaken up by the wind and whistling.

Shlok 15: The mountain was hissing as it were with fury, in the form of its terrible and most poisonous 
snakes and which sat absorbed in meditation as it were, in the form of its deep caves covered with mist.

Shlok 16: The mountain seems to be setting out on a journey on all four sides, with feet of the 
mountain, looking like rising clouds, which with its peaks having a lining of clouds, seemed to stretch 
its limbs in the sky.

Shlok 17: The mountain was embellished with a number of summits and adorned with numerous caves 
scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, palmyrah, karna and bamboo trees.

Shlok 18: The mountain was adorned with clusters of creepers having plenty of flowers, filled with 
a number of summits and adorned with numerous caves scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, 
palmyrah, karna and bamboo trees.

Shlok 19: The mountain was endowed with many cascades, crowded together with heaps of rocks and 
frequented by great sages, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras and celestial serpents.

Shlok 20: The mountain was exquisite with creepers and trees, having caves inhabited by lions, 
spread over with a number of tigers and endowed with sweet roots and fruit-trees.

Shlok 21: Hanuma, the son of wind-god, in a hurry to see Rama, ascended that mountain, excited 
as he was with an extreme joy.

Shlok 22: Then, the rocks in the charming table-land of the mountain, on which the soles of Hanuma 
lied heavily, were crushed with noise and fallen to pieces.

Shlok 23: Desirous of reaching the northern shore from the southern shore of that ocean, Hanuma 
ascended that mountain and enlarged his body.

Shlok 24: Then, the valiant Hanuma after ascending the mountain, saw the terrific ocean inhabited 
by fishes and water-snakes.

Shlok 25: Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and the son of the wind-god, entered the sky towards 
northern direction, like a wind, from southern direction.

Shlok 26: Pressed at that moment by Hanuma, that excellent mountain sank into the bowels of the 
earth along with the various living beings and made a noise with its shaking summits and toppling trees.

Shlok 27: Shaken by the impetus of the thighs of Hanuma, trees in blossom were broken and fell 
down on earth, as though struck by a thunder-bolt.

Shlok 28: When the lions of great prowess dwelling in the midst of caves were tormented and roared 
terribly, that roaring noise was heard as it was piercing the sky.

Shlok 29: The females of Vidyadhara class of supernatural beings, with their raiments in disorder 
through fear and their ornaments fallen off, went up all of a sudden from the mountain.

Shlok 30: Large poisonous serpents of immense size, possessing vigour and having fiery tongues 
with their hoods and necks severely pressed lay coiled.

Shlok 31: Then, leaving that tormented mountain of excellence; Kinnaras, Nagas, Gadharvas, Yakshas 
and Vidyadharas ascended to the sky.

Shlok 32: Pressed down by that strong Hanuma, that beautiful mountain having its elevated summits 
crowned with trees, entered the bowels of the earth.

Shlok 33: That mountain, with a width of ten yojanas (or eighty miles) and a height of thirty yojanas 
(or two hundred and forty miles) got level with the earth.

Shlok 34: With a desire to cross easily the terrific ocean, whose shores were being lashed by its 
waves, which Hanuma jumped up into the air.



SARGA 57
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma leaps from the coast of Lanka and touches Mount Mainaka, which he came across 
	in the way. He advances further and roars at the top of his voice at the Mount Mahendra, so as to 
	bring jubiliation to the monkeys awaiting his return there. Jambavan tells the monkeys, who moved 
	by jumps with joy on hearing Jambavan, that Hanuma has returned successfully, from his expedition 
	as way evident from his jubilant roar. Having greeted Jambavan, Angada and others on alighting on 
	the summit of Mount Mahendra, Hanuma narrates to them briefly the story of his discovery of Seetha. 
	Applauding Hanuma, prince Angada, who was eager to hear the story, sits down on a rock along with 
	all others.

[Text] 

Shlok 1- 2- 3- 4: Hanuma, with a rush equal to that of wind, withaut a fatigue, leapt across the baundless 
	sea looking analogaus to sky, like a large ship crossing the ocean. In that pleasant and auspiciaus 
	sky-like sea, shone the moon as a white water-like sea, shone having the constellations known by 
	the names of Pushya and Shravana as swans, the clauds as its duck-weeds; the twin constellations 
	the Punarvasus as its large fish, the planet Mars as its large alligator, a large island as Airavata 
	(Indra's elephant), graced with a swan in the form of the constellation, Shwati, having gales as 
	its waves, the moon bea.ns as its cool water and with the Nagas, yakshas and Gandharvas as its full 
	blown lotuses and water-lilies.

Shlok 5- 6: While moving in the sky, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind-god and the great 
	monkey, appeared as if swallowing the sky, scratching the moon and carrying off the sky with its 
	stars and the disc of the sun and was going as though dragging asunder, a mass of clouds.

Shlok 7: Dense clauds, with white and red colaurs, blue and yellow colaurs as also green and 
	reddish brown colaurs shone brightly in the sky.

Shlok 8: Time and again, entering and coming out of the clusters of clouds, Hanuma appeared 
	like the moon becoming visible and invisible again and again.

Shlok 9: The heroic Hanuma, who was clad in white clothes, having faund his way into variaus 
	kinds of dense clauds (and energing again) and having his personlaity becoming visible and invisible, 
	shone like the moon in the sky.

Shlok 10: Tearing asunder the clusters of clouds again and again as also energing from them 
	and roaring with a big noise, Hanuma the son of wind-god, making a thunderous great sound, shone 
	flying like Garuda the eagle, in the sky.



Killing the foremost of demons, becoming famaus by is name, making Lanka perplexed, 
	causing anguish to Ravana by tormenting his terrible army, and bidding his adieu to Sheetha, Hanuma 
	returned by flying over the middle of the sea.

Shlok 13: Touching Mount Mainaka, the victorious Hanuma came with a great speed resembling 
	an iron arrow discharged from a bow-string.

Shlok 14: Approaching a bit near and observing Maunt Mahendra, the great mauntain looking like 
	a dense claud, that Hanuma made a laud noise.

Shlok 15: Emitting a great roar, that Hanuma, whole loud noise resembled the rumbling of a 
	cloud, filled the whole space in all directions with the noise.

Shlok 16: Having reached that place, Hanuma who was ardently desiraus of seeing his friends, 
	roared and waved his tail.

Shlok 17: The sky, with the disc of the sun, began to crack as it were, due to his roar, even 
	as he repeatedly roared on the path of the sky as followed by Garuda, the eagle endowed with charming 
	wings.

Shlok 18- 19: Those mighty heroes who were waiting already on the northern shore of the sea, with 
	an eagerness to see Hanuma, heard there at that time, the saund produced by the sweeping motion 
	of Hanuma's thighs, which resembled the reoar of a huge claud propelled by the wind.

Shlok 20: All those monkeys, who were distressed in mind (for not having heard the news of 
	Seetha hitherto), heard Hanuma's roar similar to the roar of a rumbling cloud.

Shlok 21: Hearing that roar of Hanuma, who was making the saund, all those mokeys stationed 
	there in all directions, became anxiausly desiraus of seeing their friend.

Shlok 22: The Jambavan, the foremot among the monkesy and bears, with his mind thrilled with 
	joy, having summoned all the monkeys, spoke the follwoing words:

Shlok 23: "This Hanuma has accoMplished his assignment in all ways. His saund will not indeed 
	be like this, if he has not fulfilled his task. There is not daubt in this matter."

Shlok 24: Hearing the sound of the dashing movement of the high souled Hanuma's arms and thighs, 
	the monkeys moved by jumps with joy from their respective places.

Shlok 25: Those monkeys with joy, longing to see Hanuma, took off from the top of one tree 
	to the tops of other trees as also from one mauntain-summit to the other summits.

Shlok 26: Those monkeys, grasping the boughs at the tops of trees, and standing there firmly, 
	joyously waved the twigs, as if they are their raiments.

Shlok 27: The mighty, Hanuma the son of wind-god, roared as thaugh the wind roars while it 
	enters the caves of mauntains.

Shlok 28: Seeing that Hanuma then rushing like a dense cloud, all those monkeys stood there, 
	joining their palms in salutation.

Shlok 29: The swift Hanuma, looking like a mauntain, then descended on the summit of that Maunt 
	mahendra, thick with trees.

Shlok 30: Hanuma like a mountain with its wings torn off, thrilled with joy, fell from the 
	sky into a charming mountain-torrent.

Shlok 31- 32: Then, all the foremost of those monkeys, with their pleasing hearts, stood surraunding 
	the high-sauled Hanuma. Having encircled Hanuma, all of them obtained a supreme joy.

Shlok 33: All those mokeys with their delightful faces, taking roots and fruits as their presents, 
	honured Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, who came back hale and healthy.

Shlok 34: Then, Hanuma the excellent one among the monkeys, on his part, offered his salutation 
	to venerable persons and elders like Jambavan in the first place, as also Angada, the prince.

Shlok 35: Jambavan and Angada honoured that victorious and venerable Hanuma. The other monkeys 
	also made him gracious. Hanuma informed them briefly that he had seen Seetha.

Shlok 36: Then, seizing the hand of Angada, Vali's son, Hanuma sat down at a distinct spot 
	in the charming forest of Maunt Mahendra.

Shlok 37- 38- 39: Then, the pleased Hanuma spoke the following words to those excellent monkeys: "I 
	saw that Seetha, the duaghter of Janaka, who was staying in Ashoka garden, guarded unblemished by 
	highly dreadful female-demons and wearing a single braid, young woman, as she was, longing to see 
	Rama, thoroughly fatigued due to her fasting, with her hair twisted together, wearing soiled clothes 
	and looking emaciated."

Shlok 40: Hearing from Hanuma that iMportant and nectar like word to the effect that Sheetha 
	had been seen all the monkeys became delighted.

Shlok 41: Some mighty monkeys made a lion's roar. Some were making a sound of approbation. 
	Some were making a sound of thunder. Some others proudced cries expressing joy. Some others were 
	roaring in return.

Shlok 42: Shome eminent monkeys, with joy and with their tails lifted up, waved their distended 
	curved tails.

Shlok 43: Descending from the mountain-tops; some other monkeys, with delight, fondingly touched 
	Hanuma who resembled an elephant.

Shlok 44: After hearing the words of Hanuma, Angada spoke the follwoing excellent words in 
	the midst of those eminent monkeys.

Shlok 45: "O Hanuma! Since you returned here crossing the extensive ocean, none stands equal 
	to you in strength and prowess."

Shlok 46: "What amazing is yaur devotion to the Lord! What a wonderful prowess! What a surprising 
	caurage! By aur good fortune, yau saw the illustriaus Sheetha, Rama's consort. Thank heaven! Rama 
	can give up his sorrow born aut of Sheetha's separataion."

Shlok 47: Very much delighted, the monkeys then sat on extensive flat rocks encircling Angada, 
	Hanuma and Jambavan.

Shlok 48- 49: Longing to hear abaut crossing of ocean and the seeing of Lanka, Sheetha and Ravana, 
	all those excellent monkeys waited with their joined pal.ns, in anctipation of Hanuma's words.

Shlok 50: The auspicious Angada encircled by many monkeys there, waited like Indra the lord 
	of celestials, who was waited upon by celestials in heaven.

Shlok 51: The high and large summit of the mauntain, on which were seated then with delight, 
	the illustriaus Hanuma and the famaus Angada, with bracelets worn on his upper ar.ns, stood blazed 
	with splendaur.



SARGA 58
------------------------------

[Text] Jambavan, seated along with the monkey-troops, requested Hanuma to narrate clearly whatever 
has occurred. Hanuma narrates in detail how he saw Mount Mainaka in the course of his journey to Lanka 
and how he escaped on the way from the clutches of Surasa, a great serpent living in the ocean. Hanuma 
also narrated about his killing of Simhika, a female demon on the way and also about defeating another 
female demon (Lanka-incarnate) who was guarding the City of Lanka. Hanuma explains to Jambavan, how 
he beholds Seetha in Ashoka garden after a thorough search in the City of Lanka and how he introduces 
himself as an envoy sent by Rama and Sugreeva. Hanuma informs Jambavan that he hands over a finger-ring 
of Rama as a token of remembrance to Seetha and that he further asks for a return-token of remembrance 
from her, to be handed over to Rama. Hanuma then narrates about Seetha having delivered to him an excellent 
jewel for her head, as a token of remembrance. He further narrates about the demolition of the garden 
attached to Ravana's gynaecium and about killing of Aksha, Ravana's son. Hanuma further informs about 
his capture by Indrajit, Ravana's son and his tail being burnt by demons on receiving the orders of 
Ravana. He further informs about his setting fire of the City of Lanka. He finally narrates about his 
re-visit to Seetha and his return to Mount Mahendra.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, the mighty monkeys, headed by Hanuma and others, experienced a great joy 
on that summit of Mount Mahendra.

Shlok 2: Then, Jambavan, thrilling with rapture, asked the delighted Hanuma, the great monkey 
about the particulars of that actual occurrence (of seeing Seetha) as follows

Shlok 3: "How did you see Seetha? How was she there? How was that Ravana of terrible deeds behaving 
towards her?"

Shlok 4: "O Hanuma! Tell us entirely, in truth whatever has occurred. Ascertaining the truth, 
from you, we shall again think about what decision to be taken further."

Shlok 5: "When we go there (to the presence of Rama), having prudence, tell us clearly which matter 
is to be disclosed and which matter is to be kept off from him."

Shlok 6: Thus commanded by Jambavan, Hanuma, with his hair standing on end mentally offered his 
salutation to Seetha, the princess, by bowing his head and replied as follows:

Shlok 7: "With an intention to reach the southern shore of the ocean, I leapt into the sky, indeed 
before your presence, from the summit of Mount Mahendra."

Shlok 8: "While I was going, a terrific hindrance occurred in my way as it was. I saw a golden 
mountain-peak which was so charming and fascinating."

Shlok 9: "I accounted that mountain staying turned towards the path, as an impediment. Approaching 
that excellent charming and golden mountain, I made up my mind to shatter it."

Shlok 10: "As I struck it with my tail, the mountain-peak of that great hill, resembling the sun, 
was broken into a thousand pieces."

Shlok 11: "Understanding my purpose, that great mountain spoke the following sweet words saying, 
'O my son!', As though it was refreshing my mind (once more to proceed further)."

Shlok 12: " 'Know me to be generally called as Mynaa dwelling in this great ocean, as a companion 
of the wind-god and even as your father's brother'."

Shlok 13: " 'O my son! Long ago, the foremost among the mountains used to have wings. They used 
to wander the entire earth freely, hurting the people!"

Shlok 14: " 'Hearing that behaviour of those mountains, the venerable Indra the lord of celestials, 
the destroyer of a demon called Paka, chopped their wings into a thousand pieces by using his thunderbolt.' 
"

Shlok 15: " 'O child! I, on my part, was hurled into the great ocean by the high-souled wind-god, 
your father and was liberated from the clutches of Indra.' "

Shlok 16: " 'O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! I have to behave in such a way as to help Rama. 
For, Rama, having a prowess equal to that of Indra; is indeed excellent in supporting righteousness.'"

Shlok 17- 18: "Hearing the words of that high-souled Mynaka and after informing my purpose, my mind 
was prepared for a further travel. The high-soled Mynaka also allowed me to depart."

Shlok 19: "That Mynaka mountain vanished in the guise of a beautiful form of a human being. That 
large mountainous form also later drowned into the great ocean."

Shlok 20: "Thereafter, employing an excellent speed and continuing on my course, I proceeded in 
that path speedily for a long time."

Shlok 21: "Thereafter, I saw Surasa, the mother of serpents in the midst of the sea. That goddess 
spoke the following words to me.

Shlok 22: "O excellent of monkeys! The celestials have shown you as my eatable. Therefore, I will 
eat you since you have been bestowed to me by gods after a long time."

Shlok 23: "Hearing Surasa's words, I stood there, offering salutation with my joined palms to her. 
Becoming pale-faced, I spoke the following words:

Shlok 24: " 'Rama, the son of Dasaratha the splendid man and the tormentator of enemies, together 
with Lakshmana, his brother and Seetha entered the forest of Dandaka.'"

Shlok 25: " 'The evil-minded Ravana took away Seetha, Rama's wife. By the orders of Rama, I am 
going to her as an envoy.' "

Shlok 26: "'You, abiding in Rama's country, ought to do a help to Rama. Otherwise, after seeing 
Seetha and Rama, who is unwearied in action, I will come to your mouth. I am thus promising you in truth."

Shlok 27: Hearing my words, that Surasa who can assume any form at her will said: "No one can violate 
me by unfaithfulness. I have this boon with me."

Shlok 28: "Hearing the words of Surasa, I, as tall as ten Yojanas (eighty miles), within a moment, 
grew half as much in size (fifteen Yojanas or one hundred twenty miles)."

Shlok 29- 30: "She opened her mouth so wide as to correspond to the size of my body. Seeing her expanded 
mouth, I assumed a dwarfish form. At that moment, I still became reduced to the size of a human thumb."

Shlok 31: "After entering her mouth quickly, I then came out instantly. The divine Surasa, in her 
native form, spoke to me again, as follows:

Shlok 32: "'O gently monkey! O the foremost among monkeys! Go happily for the fulfillment of your 
purpose. Bring back Seetha to the magnanimous Rama. O mighty armed monkey! Be happy. I am pleased with 
you.'"

Shlok 33: "Then, all living beings praised me! Saying Good! Well done! Bravo! Thereupon, I leapt 
into the extensive sky, like Garuda the eagle, the carrier of Lord Vishnu."

Shlok 34- 35: "In the meanwhile, my shadow was held fast. Yet, I did not perceive anything. My speed 
having been blocked, I surveyed all the ten directions. But I could not discover there, any object by 
which my movement was blocked."

Shlok 36: "Then, the thought arose in me: "How I wonder has such a hindrance arose in my journey, 
although no concrete configuration is being seen here?"

Shlok 37: "While I was thinking thus, my sight has fallen downward. There, I saw a terrible female-demon 
lying in water."

Shlok 38: "Heartily laughing with a great noise, that terrific woman, spoke to me the following 
inauspicious words, firmly and without any bewilderment (as follows):

Shlok 39: "O gigantic monkey! Where are you going? You are my requisite food, hungry as I am. Gratify 
my person, who has remained without sustenance for long."

Shlok 40: "Saying 'Amen', I actually accepted those words. Thereupon, I expanded my body to a size 
larger than the capacity of her mouth."

Shlok 41: "Her terrific large mouth too began to grow to devour me. She could not understand well 
about me or about the change subsequently gone through by me (in the shape of a minute form)"

Shlok 42: "Then, having contracted my large body within another moment, I extracted her heart and 
leapt back into the sky."

Shlok 43: "When her heart has been cut off by me, that terrific Simhika looking like a mountain, 
fell into the ocean with her arms emanating from it."

Shlok 44: "I heard great sages along with wandering celestial singers, moving in the sky, saying 
that Simhika the dreadful demon was instantly killed by Hanuma."

Shlok 45: "After killing her and again recollecting the task to be performed quickly, I travelled 
for a long distance and saw the southern shore of the ocean, where that City of Lanka, adorned with 
its trees, was situated."

Shlok 46: "While the sun was setting, I, without being noticed by the demons of dreadful prowess, 
entered the city of Lanka, the abode of demons."

Shlok 47: "While I was entering the City, a woman, resembling a cloud at the time of dissolution 
of the world, stood up in front of me, emitting a loud laughter."

Shlok 48- 49: "Then defeating that woman, having her hair looking terrific like a blazing fire and 
who was trying to kill me, by striking her with a blow of the fist of my left hand and entered the land 
of Lanka at the dusk of early night. she, being frightened, spoke to me as follows:

Shlok 50: "O hero! I am (the personified) City of Lanka. Therefore, by the same prowess you conquered 
me, you can defeat all the demons here completely."

Shlok 51: "Searching there for Seetha that whole night in Ravana's gynaecium, I could not find 
that Seetha, the slender-waisted lady."

Shlok 52: "Unable to find Seetha in Ravana's dwelling and facing a sea of sorrow, I could not then 
perceive its other shore."

Shlok 53: "While bemoaning, I saw an excellent grove near that gynaecium, concealed by a prolonged 
fence painted with golden colour."

Shlok 54: Crossing the fence, I saw that grove having copious trees. Amidst that Ashoka garden, 
I saw a large Shimshupa* garden. After ascending it, I beheld an yellow-pigmented thicket of banana 
plants."

[Commentary] * Botanical name: Delbergia sissoo.

Shlok 55-56-57: "Not far from that Shimshupa tree. I saw Seetha, of youthful complexion, with eyes looking 
like lotus-petals, with her face emaciated by fasting, clad in a single piece of cloth, her hair soiled 
with dust, her limbs afflicted with grief and agony, devoted as she was to the good of her lord and 
surrounded on all sides by ugly and cruel female-demons living on flesh and blood, as a doe encircled 
by tigresses."

Shlok 58- 59- 60: "Seetha, who had eyes like those of a deer, was somehow quickly found by me looking depressed 
in the amidst of female-demons, frightened (as she was by them) again and again, putting on a single 
braid of hair (as a mark of desolation), wholly devoted to the thought of her lord, having floor as 
her bedstead, pale-limbed like a lotus-stalk in a cool season, turning away the request of Ravana, and 
determined to die."

Shlok 61: "Seeing that illustrious woman, the consort of Rama in such a state, I stayed perched 
on the same Simsupa tree, looking at her."

Shlok 62: "Meanwhile, I heard an exceedingly roaring and hallooing sound, mixed with sounds of 
girdles and anklets in the abode of Ravana."

Shlok 63: "Then, I was very much frightened and contracted my physique. I, on my part, remained 
hidden like a bird in that Simsupa tree dense with foliage.'"

Shlok 64: "Then, the mighty Ravana and his wives reached that place where Seetha was staying."

Shlok 65: "Thereupon, seeing that Ravana the chief of a troop of demons, Seetha with her lovely 
waist, sat compressing her thighs enclosing her swollen breasts with her arms."

Shlok 66- 67: "Ravana, bowing his head and coming down, spoke (as follows) to that Seetha who was frightened, 
very much grieving for her lord, glancing hither and thither, not finding any protection for her, trembling, 
distressed and extremely sorrowful saying, 'Treat me with respect.'"

Shlok 68: " 'O arrogant lady! O Seetha! If you refuse me by your arrogance, I will be drinking 
your blood after a period of two months.'"

Shlok 69: "Hearing those words of the evil-minded Ravana, Seetha was very much irritated and spoke 
the following excellent words:

Shlok 70: "How did your tongue not fall of, O the worst demon, by speaking such words not to be 
uttered, to the consort of Rama, of boundless glory, and the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha the lord of 
Ikshvaku dynasty?"

Shlok 71: "O ignoble soul! Of what account is your prowess, when you came unnoticed during the 
absence of my lord, that great soul and abducted me, O sinful one?"

Shlok 72: " 'You have no similarity with Rama. You are unfit even to do service to Rama. Rama performs 
sacrifices. He speaks only truth. He is a lover of battle'."

Shlok 73: "Hearing these harsh words from Seetha, Ravana was at once ablaze with anger, as a fire 
blazes in a pile of wood."

Shlok 74: " 'Rolling his cruel eyes and lifting his right fist, Ravana was about to kill Seetha. 
Then, an alarm was raised by a women there'."

Shlok 75: "Springing up from the midst of those women, a royal woman named Mandodari, the wife 
of that evil-minded Ravana, ran to him. He was restrained by her."

Shlok 76: "She spoke to Ravana, smitten with love, the following sweet words: 'O Ravana having 
a prowess similar to that of Indra! Of what need is with Seetha to you?"

Shlok 77: " 'O lord! Enjoy yourself with the daughters of gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians 
and Yakshas the semi-divine beings. What will you do with Seetha?'"

Shlok 78: "Thereupon, those women together propitiated that mighty Ravana and quickly took him 
to his palace."

Shlok 79: "When that Ravana left, the ugly-faced female-demons frightened. Seetha with their cruel 
and very dreadful words."

Shlok 80: "Seetha reckoned the utterance of those women as a blade of grass. At that time, the 
roaring of those female-demons reached Seetha in vain."

Shlok 81: "As their roaring frittered away, those flesh-eating female-demons became helpless and 
reported that great resolve of Seetha to Ravana."

Shlok 82: "Thereafter, all those women joined together, warded off their hopes and held back their 
effort. In the end, they encircled Seetha and were overpowered with sleep."

Shlok 83: "When those women went to sleep, Seetha, intent upon the welfare of her husband, was 
deeply aggrieved, miserable and sore depressed as she was, lamenting pitifully."

Shlok 84- 85: "Trijata, rising from the midst of those female-demons, spoke the following words; 'Feed 
on yourself quickly rather than on Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, a virtuous woman and the daughter-in-law 
of Dasartha who des not get destroyed'."

Shlok 86: "'Now, I have seen a dreadful dream, causing my hair to stand erect. It is pointing towards 
the ruin of our demons and the victory of her husband."

Shlok 87: " ï¿½We will pray Seetha, who is capable of protecting all our female-demons from Rama. 
I feel that it is batter for us'."

Shlok 88: " 'When such a dream is seen while a woman is weeping, that woman gets relieved of many 
kinds of sorrows and will obtain happiness. Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, indeed will be pleased on 
receiving a salutation'."

Shlok 89: "Delighted at hearing the victory of her lord, that girl Seetha then basfully spoke: 
'If it is true, I will be protecting you all'."

Shlok 90: "Taking rest for some time and seeing such a dreadful state of Seetha, I reflected upon 
it. My mind could not satisfy itself."

Shlok 91: "Thinking about a means for starting a conversation with Seetha, I started to describe 
the history of Ikshvaku's dynasty."

Shlok 92: "Hearing the words spoken by me, which are adored by the assemblies of royal sages, Seetha 
the princess, with her eyes filled with tears, spoke to me, as follows:"

Shlok 93: " 'O the foremost among the monkeys! Who are you? Why did you come here? How did you 
come? What type of friendship do you have with Rama? You ought to tell me all this?"

Shlok 94- 95: "Hearing those words of Seetha, I spoke the following words: 'O princess! There is a 
courageous king of monkeys, by name Sugreeva, who is a mighty companion to your husband, possessing 
a terrific prowess."

Shlok 96: "Know me, who came here, as Hanuma, a servant of that Sugreeva, Rama, you husband, who 
is unwearied in his actions, sent me here for your sake."

Shlok 97: "O illustrious lady! Rama, the foremost among men and the glorious man, gave this finger-ring 
personally to you as a token of remembrance."

Shlok 98: "O princess! For that reason, I wish to have a command from you. What am I to do? I shall 
take you to the proximity of Rama and Lakshmana. What do you say?"

Shlok 99: "Hearing my words and understanding them, Seetha the daughter of Janaka said as follows: 
'Let Rama take me back, after killing Ravana'."

Shlok 100: "Bowing my head in salutation to the noble and irreproachable Seetha, I asked for a token 
of remembrance which would gladden the heart of Rama."

Shlok 101: "Then, Seetha spoke to me as follows: 'Let this foremost jewel, be taken, by which the 
long-armed Rama will be having a high opinion of you'."

Shlok 102: "Speaking thus, Seetha having fine hips, gave that wonderful and the foremost jewel. 
Highly distressed, she gave a message also in words to me."

Shlok 103: "Then, offering salutation to Seetha the princess in utmost devotion, I circumambulated 
her from left to right, of course with my mind setting out to come here."

Shlok 104: "Determining something in mind, she spoke to me again as follows: 'O Hanuma! You ought 
to tell Rama about my tale of woes occurring here'."

Shlok 105: " 'Act so that both those heroes Rama and Lakshmana together with Sugreeva quickly arrive 
here, soon after hearing my tale'."

Shlok 106: "'If proves to be otherwise, my survival will be only for two months. Rama cannot see 
me thereafter. As such, I will be dying like a helpless woman'."

Shlok 107: "Hearing those miserable words, I became angry. Thereafter, I thought of my remaining 
successive action to be done."

Shlok 108: "Thereafter, my body grew up to a size equal to that of a mountain. Then, I started destroying 
that garden, thereby longing for a combat."

Shlok 109: "The female-demons; with their ugly faces woke up and saw that thicket of garden being 
broken and with its frightened animals and birds moving about unsteadily."

Shlok 110: "Coming from their respective places and seeing me in that garden, those female-demons 
quickly went and reported the matter to Ravana (as follows):"

Shlok 111: "O mighty king! Indeed not knowing your prowess, an evil-minded monkey ahs demolished 
your inaccessible garden."

Shlok 112: "O emperor! Give orders quickly for killing him, so that the evil-minded monkey, who 
caused offence to you, will get destroyed."

Shlok 113: "Hearing those words, Ravana sent invincible demons called Kinkaras, who were adapted 
to the mind of Ravana."

Shlok 114: "In that portion of the garden, I destroyed with an iron rod, eight thousand kinkaras, 
having darts and hammers in their hands."

Shlok 115: "Taking quick steps, those few who have survived, went and reported the news to Ravana, 
of their large army having been killed by me."

Shlok 116: "Then, an idea came to me. Occupying a lofty palatial mansion of a sanctuary which was 
an eminent ornament of Lanka. I killed again a hundred demons stationed there with a pillar."

Shlok 117: "Then, Ravana dispatched Jambumali, the son of Prahasta together with numerous dreadful 
demons having terrific forms."

Shlok 118: "I destroyed that demon, though endowed with a great strength and skilled in warfare, 
along with his followers, with my terrific iron bar itself."

Shlok 119: "Hearing of it, Ravana, the king of demons, dispatched the son of his minister, endowed 
with great strength and strengthened with a regiment of infantry."

Shlok 120- 121: "I killed all of them also by that iron bar itself. Hearing of the minster's sons, who 
were quick in exhibiting their valour in battle, having been killed, Ravana dispatched five valiant 
generals."

Shlok 122: "I got all the minster's sons together with their army destroyed. Then, Ravana, the ten-headed 
monster, sent his mighty son, Aksha together with a multitude of army for the combat."

Shlok 123- 124: "I suddenly caught by the feet, that prince, son of Mandodari, who was skilled in warfare 
and who was jumping into the sky with his sword and shield. I whirled him round a hundred times and 
crushed him."

Shlok 125: "Hearing of the death of Aksha in combat, that ten-headed Ravana was very much enraged 
and thereupon dispatched his second son, by name Indrajit, who was strong but foolishly arrogant in 
battle."

Shlok 126: "By conquering all that army in battle and making that Indrajit the foremost among demons; 
lusterless, I experienced a great joy."

Shlok 127: "Ravana himself dispatched, with a great confidence, that long-armed and mighty Indrajit 
along with valiant demons excited with their arrogance."

Shlok 128: "Knowing me to be irresistible and his own army being perishable, that Indrajit with 
a great haste, captured me with a Brahma-missile."

Shlok 129: "Then, the demons, after capturing me, tied me there with ropes and carried me away to 
Ravana's presence."

Shlok 130: "Seeing me, the evil-minded Ravana spoke to me. He asked, why did you come to Lanka? 
'Why did you kill the demons?'"

Shlok 131- 132: "I answered 'I have done all these acts for the sake of Seetha. O king of demons! I came 
to your abode with a desire to see Seetha. I am the offspring of wind-god and a monkey by name Hanuma'."

Shlok 133: " 'Know me to be a monkey, an envoy of Rama and a minister of Sugreeva. As Rama's messenger, 
I sought your presence here!"

Shlok 134: " ï¿½That Sugreeva of great splendour enquired about your welfare. He told you (the following) 
beneficiary words, endowed with righteousness wealth and pleasure, appropriate for you'."

Shlok 135: " 'While I was dwelling in Mount R^ishyamuka, abounding with numerous trees, Rama having 
a great prowess in battle became a friend to me'."

Shlok 136: " 'The king Rama told me that his wife had been taken away by a demon and that I had 
to help him in that matter by all means'."

Shlok 137: " 'I also told him about the killing of Vali and requested him to come to a mutual agreement 
for helping me in that matters'."

Shlok 138: " 'Rama, the great lord along with Lakshmana made friendship with Sugreeva, (whose kingdom 
was taken away by Vali) taking Agni the fire-god for a witness.'

Shlok 139: " 'Killing Vali by a single arrow in combat, Rama made Sugreeva (lord of monkeys) an 
emperor of monkeys'."

Shlok 140: " 'Now we have to extend help to that Rama in all ways. Therefore, I am sending Hanuma 
rightly to your presence'."

Shlok 141: " 'Even before the heroic monkeys destroy your army, bring Seetha quickly and give her 
back to Rama'."

Shlok 142: " 'To whom is this strength of the monkeys not already known, who go even to the presence 
of gods, when invited by them for help?'"

Shlok 143: " 'Sugreeva the king of monkeys has sent the foregoing message to you. 'When spoken by 
me in these words, Ravana was enraged and looked on me, as though he was going to reduce me to ashes 
with his very looks."

Shlok 144: "Without knowing my glory ( in the form of my immunity to death), the evil-minded Ravana, 
the demon doing terrific acts, ordered for my killing."

Shlok 145: "Then, there is the brother of that Ravana, called Vibhishana having a great intelligence. 
He entreated Ravana, the king of demons, on my behalf (as follows)"

Shlok 146: "O Ravana the foremost among the demons! No such attempt should be made in this way. 
Let this design be abandoned forthwith. Your are indeed following a path which is contrary to the statesmanship."

Shlok 147: "O Ravana! It is not indeed found in states' policies of killing an envoy. The real truth 
is to be known from an envoy speaking a good counsel."

Shlok 148: "O Ravana of great prowess! Even if a very high offence is committed by an envoy, an 
act of disfiguring the person is mentioned in a treatise of state-policy and not of killing."

Shlok 149: "Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana ordered those demons to burn my tail by fire."

Shlok 150: "Thereupon, hearing Ravana's words; the demons wrapped up my entire tail with bark of 
hemp and torn cotton-clothes."

Shlok 151: "Thereafter, the demons of terrible prowess, who completed their arrangements, striking 
me with their wooden staffs and fists, burnt my tail. Eventhough I was bound with many ropes, I maintained 
restraint."

Shlok 152: "Then, having reached the city-gate, those strong demons made a loud proclamation of 
my presence in the principal streets, bound and enveloped in flames as I was."

Shlok 153- 154: "Then, after contracting my gigantic form once more and releasing my bondage, I stood 
in my native form again. Seizing an iron bar, I killed those demons."

Shlok 155: "Then, I quickly jumped on to that city-gate and without any bewilderment, I set fire 
that city with its attics, ramparts and gates with my tail inflamed, even as a fire at the end of the 
world, burns all living creatures."

Shlok 156- 157: "The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore 
Seetha also must have been surely burnt."

Shlok 158- 159: "Thus filled with grief, I came about to reflect as above. Meanwhile, I heard the auspiciously 
worded utterance of charanas the celestial signers who were narrating a tale of astonishment saying 
that Seetha has not been burnt."

Shlok 160: "After hearing those surprising words, a thought arose in me that Seetha escaped being 
burnt. This indicated by the following good omens:

Shlok 161: "In the first place, even though me tail is burning, the fire is not burning my body. 
My heart too is delighted. The winds are sweet-smelling."

Shlok 162: "My heart was delighted by seeing those good omens having their fruits apparent, by looking 
into the their fruits apparent, by looking into the reasons of high characteristics and by hearing the 
words of accomplished sages."

Shlok 163: "Seeing Seetha once more, relieved by her again and then reaching the Mount Arishta there 
again, I started leaping back (over the sea) with a longing to see you (all)."

Shlok 164: "Then, treading upon the path of the sky, frequented by the wind, the moon, the sun, 
Siddhas the semi-divine beings and Gandharvas the celestial musicians, I saw you all here."

Shlok 165: "I performed all tasks for accomplishing the purpose of Sugreeva, by the grace of Rama 
and also through your energy."

Shlok 166: "I have done all this properly there. Do accomplish that which remains undone in this 
task by me and complete it."

[Text] Describing the plight of Seetha to his fellow monkeys, Hanuma expresses his feeling that 
it behoved them all to see Rama only after restoring Seetha from Lanka. Hanuma says that even single-handed, 
he is capable of destroying that City of Lanka with its troops of demons, and killing Ravana, much more 
so when accompanied by heroic, mighty and powerful monkeys. Then, he recounts the past heroic exploits 
of Jambavan, Angada, Neela, Panasa, Mainda and Dvivida. Hanuma thus incites them all to decide consciously 
of a war against Lanka.

Shlok 1: After informing all this, Hanuma the son of wind-god started telling more of the following 
words.

Shlok 2: "By the power of virtuousness of Seetha, Rama's effort and Sugreeva's zeal are getting 
fulfilled. My mind too is devoted to her."

Shlok 3: "Ravana, the king of demons, who is strong in all ways, can burn away the three worlds 
by the power of his penance. Even if he is enraged, he can scorch away his adversaries."

Shlok 4: "His body, which touched Seetha the daughter of Janaka, was not destroyed because of 
his askesis. Even a flame, when fully touched with one's hand, cannot do that which Seetha would, if 
stirred by anger."

Shlok 5- 6: "This work (of mine in the form of Seetha's discovery) has been informed to you in this 
way. It is indeed proper to see those two princes (Rama and Lakshmana) along with Seetha, after taking 
permission from all the great monkeys headed by Jambavan.

Shlok 7: "I am sufficient, even alone; to destroy rapidly that City of Lanka together with those 
troops of demons as also the mighty Ravana."

Shlok 8: "When accompanied by you, who are strong, whose spirit is disciplined, who are proficient 
in the use of arms, valiant, longing for victory and moving by jumps, how much more is required?"

Shlok 9: "In the battle, I on my part will kill Ravana along with his army, his forerunners, his 
sons and his brothers."

Shlok 10: "In the battle, I can blow out the missiles presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, 
Brahma the creator, Rudra the god of destruction, Vayu the wind-god, Varuna the god of water and even 
those missiles even if they are difficult to be looked at, employed by Indrajit (Ravana's eldest son).

Shlok 11- 12: "My prowess, when permitted by you, will frustrate that Ravana. The shower of rocks, 
which will be unequalled and incessant, discharged by me, can kill even celestials. How much more those 
demons?"

Shlok 13: "The ocean may overflow its shore. Mount Mandara may move from its position. But, in 
battle, no army of adversaries can stagger Jambavan."

Shlok 14: "The heroic Angada, the son of Vali alone, is sufficient to destroy all the troops of 
demons and even the demons who were their progenitors."

Shlok 15: "By the rapid movement of the thighs of the high-souled Neela and of Panasa, even Mount 
Mandara can be shattered. How much more, the demons in battle?"

Shlok 16: "Tell me any one who can fight against Mainda or Dvivida, among Gandharvas the celestial 
singers or Uragas the serpents or Pakshis the birds or the celestials or the demons or Yakshas the semi-divine 
beings."

Shlok 17: "These two illustrious sons of Ashvini Kumaras, Mainda and Dvivida are the foremost among 
the monkeys. In the battle-field, I do not find anyone who can fight against these two monkeys."

Shlok 18: "Proud of having received boons from Brahma the creator and their grandfather and abiding 
in a supreme haughtiness, these two foremost among all the monkeys live on Amrita the nectar."

Shlok 19: "Long ago, Brahma the grandfather of all the worlds gave an unequal boon to them in honour 
of Ashvini Kumaras regarding their inviolability."

Shlok 20: "By the pride of those boons, those two heroic monkeys harassed a great army of celestials 
and thereupon drank up nectar, excited as they were with joy."

Shlok 21: "Let all the other monkeys stand aside. Even these Mainda and Dvivida on their part are 
capable of destroying the entire city of Lanka together with its horses, chariots and elephants."

Shlok 22: "I alone burnt and destroyed the City of Lanka. In all its royal high-ways, the name 
(of Rama and others) was proclaimed by me as follows:

Shlok 23- 24: "'Victorious is Rama, the exceedingly strong and the mighty Lakshmana too! Victorious 
is King Sugreeva, protected by Rama. I am Hanuma, a servant of Rama and the son of wind-god'. In this 
way, the name (of Rama and others) was heralded by me everywhere."

Shlok 25- 26: "In the midst of Ashoka garden of the evil-minded Ravana and underneath a Shimshupa tree, 
the virtuous Seetha was seen staying dejected, encircled as she was with female-demons, agonized with 
grief and anguish, lusterless like a digit of the moon encircled by a line of clouds and disregarding 
that Ravana who is arrogant of his strength."

Shlok 27- 28: "Seetha, a devoted and virtuous wife, having charming hips, has been placed under restraint. 
The auspicious Seetha is devoted to Rama in all ways, giving her undivided thought to Rama like Shachi 
the goddess, giving her concern to Indra the destroyer of strong holds."

Shlok 29: "Weaving that single piece of cloth, which she had on her person even while being borne 
away by Ravana, and likewise covered with dust, she was seen by me in a miserable condition with her 
grief and anguish, devoted as she was to the welfare of her husband."

Shlok 30- 31: "I saw Seetha in a royal pleasure garden, amidst some female-demons. Seetha was being 
frightened time and again by those ugly female-demons. That Seetha, wearing a single braid of hair and 
looking depressed, was fully engaged in thinking about her lord. Looking like a lotus with a discoloured 
figure in winter, she had determined to die, utterly averting to do anything with Ravana."

Shlok 32- 33: "With great difficulty, I created confidence in that fawn-eyed Seetha. Thereafter, I 
talked to her and explained everything to her. She was delighted to hear the companionship cropped up 
between Rama and Sugreeva."

Shlok 34: "That high-souled Seetha does not kill Ravana who has committed an offence because she 
conducts herself well with restraint and since supreme is her devotion to her lord."

Shlok 35: "Rama, on his part, will become mere instrument in killing that Ravana. That Seetha, 
who is by her own nature, on delicate-limbed woman, was emaciated because of separation from her lord. 
She had grown thin like the learning of a scholar continuing his studies even on the first day of lunar 
fortnight (which must be observed as a complete holiday by students."

Shlok 36: "Thus, the illustrious Seetha remains immersed in grief. Let all that be done, which 
requires to be counteracted by way of a relief in this matter."



SARGA 60
------------------------------

[Text] Angada suggest with enthusiasm that Seetha must be restored by them only, after conquering 
Lanka. But Jambavan replies that it is not proper for them to do like that without enquiring about Rama's 
intention.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words of Hanuma, Angada the son of Vali spoke as follows: "Even after our 
seeing of Seetha, it is not proper for us to approach the high-souled Rama without taking Seetha with 
us."

Shlok 2: "I perceive it as improper to inform there that Seetha the princess, though seen by you 
of renowned prowess, has not been brought here."

Shlok 3: "O the best of monkeys! No one is equal to us even in our prowess nor indeed anyone who 
can leap like us in the worlds either of celestials or demons."

Shlok 4: "Hanuma indeed thus killed all the warriors among the demons. What work is remaining 
to be done by us? We will go, after taking Janaki."

Shlok 5: Jambavan, the foremost among the forest-animals, understanding the sense, was very much 
pleased and spoke the following meaningful words to that Angada, who thus formed a resolution.

Shlok 6: "O prince! This thought you thus perceive is not incompetent of us. But, you must see 
the way in which Rama's inclination would be, for the accomplishment of the object."



SARGA 61
------------------------------

[Text] Leaving Mount Mahendra and leaping ahead towards Kishkindha, the monkeys on their way 
halt at Madhuvana, a protected grove abounded in honey which was dear to Sugreeva and guarded by the 
monkey, Dahimukha. When the monkeys started to enjoy drinking of honey in the grove with the permission 
of Prince Angada, Dahimukha hinders in their way. The monkeys bruise Dadhimukha with their nails and 
teeth.

Shlok 1: Thereupon, the heroic monkeys like Angada and others as also Hanuma, the great one among 
the monkeys accepted the words of Jambavan.

Shlok 2- 3- 4- 5- 6: Then, the excellent monkeys, resembling Meru and Mandara mountains, like elephants in 
rut, as if covering the sky, having huge bodies and colossal strength, keeping Hanuma in their front, 
leaving Mount Mahendra, went ahead leaping delightfully. They looked as though conducted by the mind's 
eyes of Hanuma, who is adored by living beings as having good stupendous swiftness, they having resolved 
to fulfill the purpose of Rama and to attain a great glory, having accomplished the purpose and duly 
determined to complete the task. All of them were looking up at narrating the previous pleasant tidings 
and taking delight in war. All of them, in high spirits, were judging rightly the vengeance of Rama 
against the evil-minded Ravana.

Shlok 7: Then, those monkeys, leaping into the sky and floating in the air, reached a garden looking 
like Nandanavana the divine grove filled with trees and creepers.

Shlok 8: They reached, that Madhuvana by name, the garden abounded with honey, which was protected 
grove, unapproachable for all and looking fascinated to the soul of all beings.

Shlok 9: A very powerful monkey called Dadhimukha, who was a high-souled eminent monkey and the 
maternal uncle of Sugreeva always protected that garden.

Shlok 10: Reaching that huge grove, which was very dear to the heart of Sugreeva, those monkeys 
became highly excessive in their behaviour.

Shlok 11: Then, seeing that large Madhuvana, the garden abounded in honey, those monkeys, whose 
colour was as yellow as honey, were delighted and solicited Angada the prince for permission to taste 
the honey.

Shlok 12: Thereupon, Angada the prince, taking approval from those elders like Jambavan and others, 
gave the monkeys a liberty to drink honey there.

Shlok 13: Thereafter, all those monkeys, thus permitted to drink honey, were exceedingly pleased. 
Then, those excited monkeys felt glad and began dancing.

Shlok 14: Some were singing. Some were offering salutations. Some were dancing. Some were laughing 
loudly. Some were falling down. Some were moving in different directions. Some were jumping up. Some 
were talking incoherently.

Shlok 15: Some were leaning against one another. Some were falling upon one another. Some were 
disputing with one another. Some were playing with one another.

Shlok 16: Some were running from one tree to another. Some were falling down to the ground from 
the tree-tops. Some, with a missile-like speed, were flying towards the tops of gigantic trees from 
the ground.

Shlok 17: While one was singing, another approached him laughing. While one was laughing, another 
approached him weeping. While one was weeping, another approached him pushing. While one was pushing, 
another approached him roaring.

Shlok 18: That army of monkeys, moving in excessively honey-drunken state, became highly excited. 
None in that army was not drunk. None in that army was not satiated.

Shlok 19: Seeing that grove, being consumed and the trees stripped off their leaves and flowers 
the monkey named Dadhimukha (who was incharge of the grove) then angrily interrupted those monkeys.

Shlok 20: Threatened by those monkeys who were behaving excessively, Dadhimukha who was endowed 
with a terrible energy, the care-taker of the grove and an elderly hero of the monkeys further contemplated 
the means to protect that grove from the monkeys.

Shlok 21: He spoke harsh words with some and courageously struck some others with his palms uninterruptedly, 
created a quarrel by coming into collusion with some, and approached some in a conciliatory manner.

Shlok 22: That Dadhimukha was dragged, after coming into collusion with him by those monkeys, who 
were being forcibly hindered by him, eventhough those monkeys overpowered him with unrestrained emotion 
arising out of their intoxication, those who had abandoned their fear disregarding any bad consequence 
of their act.

Shlok 23: Bruising with their nails, biting with their teeth on account of their inebriety and 
making short work of that Dadhimukha with their palms and feet, all those moneys made that large grove, 
divested of its flowers, fruits and honey.



SARGA 62
------------------------------

[Text] The monkeys enter Madhuvana and partake the honey in plenty, as permitted by Hanuma and 
Angada. Singing and dancing as if in a drunken state, the monkeys were obstructed by those guarding 
the grove. The terrific monkeys warded off the guards, nay, they even dragged them by their knees and 
tossed them up in the air. The guards then went to Dadhimukha, the chief of the garden-guards and complained 
him of the matter. Dadhimukha along with his followers appears on the scene and invade the monkeys with 
trees and rocks. Angada thrashed Dadhimukha with his arms and made him fall on the ground. Dadhimukha 
along with his followers then proceed to Kishkindha to report the matter to him. Dadhimukha bows down 
and touches Sugreeva's feet as a mark of salutation.

Shlok 1: Hanuma, like a bull among the monkeys and the foremost among them spoke to them as follows: 
"Cherish the honey with a cool mind, O monkeys! I will keep off your opposer who is standing in your 
way."

Shlok 2: Hearing the words of Hanuma, the gracious minded Angada the principal among the monkeys 
repeated the words: "Let the monkeys drink the honey."

Shlok 3: "The words, though improper of Hanuma who had accomplished his task, are to be obliged 
certainly by me. Wherefore then, moreover, on such an occasion?"

Shlok 4: Hearing the words coming from the mouth of Angada, those monkeys who were like bulls 
among the monkeys were delighted and answered with reverence, saying 'good, good!'

Shlok 5: Reverencing Angada the foremost among the monkeys, all the monkeys rushed towards Madhuvana, 
the grove abounding in honey, like the rush of a river towards a tree.

Shlok 6- 7: Because Hanuma had seen Seetha and others had heard of her and because of the grant of 
permission from Angada, all those gifted monkeys entered Madhuvana the grove, overpowered the guards 
with their prowess, drank honey and the partook juicy fruits there.

Shlok 8: Then, all those monkeys jumped on the guards of the grove, who came there in hundreds 
together and banged them.

Shlok 9: All those monkeys together took vessels of honey in their arms and drank them. Some others 
banged those who obstructed them.

[Commentary] Drona= A wooden vessel containing 1024 Mushtis/fists of honey.

Shlok 10: Some monkeys, with their skin-colour as yellow as honey, after drinking vessels of honey, 
also threw some honey away. Some others, with the remnant of honey in their arms, after drinking, whipped 
up one another with their excessive intoxication.

Shlok 11: Some others, seizing a branch of a tree, stood rooted at the foot of a tree. Some, who 
were highly intoxicated, laid down spreading leaves on the ground.

Shlok 12: Those monkeys, who were intoxicated by drinking the honey, became inebriated and started 
pushing one another cheerfully and some others began to stumble.

Shlok 13: Some were roaring like lions. Some, with joy, whistled like birds. Some monkeys, inebriated 
as they were by drinking honey, simply slept on the floor.

Shlok 14: Doing something or other, some were laughing. Some others were doing something else. 
Some were telling what they were doing, while some others were understanding some things else.

Shlok 15: The honey-keepers, who were there as messengers of Dadhimukha in that Madhuvana, were 
warded off by the terrific monkeys and they fled to different directions.

Shlok 16: Dragged by their knees and tossed up in the air by the monkeys, those honey-keepers were 
very much depressed, went to Dadhimukha and complained as follows:

Shlok 17: "The monkeys, as permitted by Hanuma, violently destroyed Madhuvana. We were dragged 
by our knees and further tossed up in the air."

Shlok 18: Hearing that Madhuvana was damaged, Dadhimukha, the grove-protector there was enraged 
and thereafter consoled those monkeys (as follows):

Shlok 19: "Come here let us go there and prevent by our force, the monkeys who are arrogant of 
their strength and are consuming the honey."

Shlok 20: Hearing these words of Dadhimukha, the foremost of those monkeys who displayed their 
heroism, quickly went again to madhuvana along with him.

Shlok 21: Grasping a tree, Dadhimukha speedily took up his position in the middle of those monkeys 
in Madhuvana. All his follower-monkeys also ran with him.

Shlok 22: Those enraged monkeys, taking rocks, trees and even mountains, went to the place wehre 
those foremost of monkeys were there.

Shlok 23: Those heroic monkeys, keeping the words of their master in mind, briskly ran with Sala 
trees, palm trees and rocks as their weapons.

Shlok 24: Then, the valiant guards of the grove running in thousands invaded the monkeys who were 
on trees, at the foot of the trees and who were arrogant of their strength.

Shlok 25: Seeing Dadhimukha coming with anger, Hanuma along with eminent monkeys ran towards him 
with speed.

Shlok 26: The enraged Angada struck there with his arms, that long-armed Dadhimukha the maternal 
uncle his father, who was endowed with extraordinary might and who was rushing with speed with a tree 
in his hand.

Shlok 27: Blinded with arrogance, that Angada did not show any mercy to him on the score of his 
being the maternal uncle of his father and caused him at once to fall down and began to crush him against 
the ground.

Shlok 28: That Dadhimukha, the valiant elephant among the monkeys, who was afflicted with his broken 
arms, thighs and shoulders, drenched as he was in blood, lost his consciousness for a moment.

Shlok 29: That Dadhimukha, Sugreeva's maternal uncle, quickly recovering his breath, was enraged 
and resisted those monkeys, who were highly intoxicated because of drinking of honey, by a proper reprimand.

Shlok 30: Somehow released by those monkeys that Dadhimukha the foremost among the monkeys, went 
to a solitary place and spoke to his messengers who came there (as follows):

Shlok 31: "Let these monkeys stay here. We will go to the place where the thick-necked Sugreeva, 
our lord of the monkeys stays together with Rama."

Shlok 32: "I will make known to the king, all the misdeed of Angada. Hearing my words, the enraged 
king will get the monkeys killed."

Shlok 33: "This Madhuvana is indeed cherished by our high-souled king, Sugreeva and it derived 
from his father and grand father. It is so charming, but is dangerous to be approached even by celestials."

Shlok 34: "The longevity of these monkeys got reduced, as they were very much lustful of honey. 
That Sugreeva can get these monkeys together with their companions, killed as a matter of punishment."

Shlok 35: "These evil-minded beings, who disregarded the royal command, are fit to be capitally 
punished. Our wrath, springing from our impatience, will indeed become fruitful."

Shlok 36: Thus speaking to the garden-guards, the mighty Dadhimukha quickly springing up all at 
once, went (to Kishkindha) together with the garden-guards.

Shlok 37: That Dadhimukha, the monkey, reached the place where that Sugreeva, the intelligent monkey 
was there, within an interval of only a moment.

Shlok 38: Seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva, Dadhimukha descended to a level ground, from the 
sky.

Shlok 39- 40: That Dadhimukha of a great prowess, the supreme lord of the guards, surrounded by all 
those garden-guards keeping a sad face, made a respectful salutation to Sugreeva with his head, by falling 
down and touching with his head, the auspicious feet of Sugreeva.



SARGA 63
------------------------------

[Text] Dadhimukha comes to Sugreeva and reports that Madhuvana, the grove abounding in honey, 
has been damaged by monkeys headed by Angada and Hanuma. When Lakshmana in the vicinity enquires Sugreeva 
about the matter, Sugreeva says that by hearing about the jubilation of the monkeys, it can be concluded 
that Seetha has been traced out. Assuaging Dadhimukha, Sugreeva asks him to send without delay, Hanuma, 
Angada and others to him, so as to hear about their efforts in tracing out Seetha.

Shlok 1: Just on seeing Dadhimukha, who fell touching his feet with his head, Sugreeva the chief 
of monkeys, with an agitated mind, spoke the following words:

Shlok 2: "O valiant monkey! Stand up, rise! Why have you fallen on my feet? I grant you immunity 
from fear. Let the entire truth be spoken!"

Shlok 3: Thus inspired by the high-souled Sugreeva with confidence, that highly intelligent Dadhimukha, 
rising up, spoke the following words:

Shlok 4: "O king! Madhuvana was indeed not set free previously at any time by Riksharajas, your 
father, or by you, or by even Vali. That Madhuvana has been consumed away by the monkeys."

Shlok 5: "When these guards of the grove obstructed the monkeys, they disregarded the guards and 
continue to eat the fruits and drink the honey too."

Shlok 6: "Some are throwing away a remnant of honey, after drinking it there and some others are 
consuming that remnant. When prevented by us, all of them are indeed exhibiting their eye-brows to us 
(in anger)."

Shlok 7: "When these guards of the grove became angry and tried to keep them off from the grove, 
those enraged monkeys threatened them."

Shlok 8: "O chief of monkeys! Then, those valiant monkeys in large numbers, having their red eyes 
in anger, drove away these monkeys."

Shlok 9: "Those monkeys struck some of the guards with their hands. They beat some of them with 
their knees. They dragged some of them and tossed them into air."

Shlok 10: "While you are in the position of a king, those monkeys have beaten these valiant guards 
and are eating away the entire Maduvana too."

Shlok 11: Lakshmana, the killer of hostile heroes and a very wise man, asked that Sugreeva, the 
excellent of monkeys (as follows) while Dadhimukha was thus reporting to him:

Shlok 12: "O king! Why has this monkey the garden-protector, come here?' Pointing out what matter 
has this monkey in grief, spoken these words to you?"

Shlok 13: Hearing the words of the high-souled Lakshmana, the eloquent Sugreeva replied to him 
as follows:

Shlok 14: "O esteemed Lakshmana! Dadhimukha, the valiant monkey is informing that the foremost 
of monkeys, who returned from the southern direction, after searching for Seetha as also Angada and 
other heroes consumed honey."

Shlok 15- 16: "By seeing the manner in which these returned monkeys overpowered, destroyed and behaved 
towards Madhuvana, we can deduce that the monkeys would not have indulged in such an exploit, had they 
not accomplished my purpose."

Shlok 17: "When those monkeys have overpowered Madhuvana, then it means that our task has been 
accomplished by the monkeys. Seetha was found. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen 
Seetha."

Shlok 18: "There is none other than, Hanuma who is the executor in accomplishing this work. In 
that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, capacity to accomplish any object; intelligence; strenuous, 
vigour effort; and learning are well established in his life."

Shlok 19: "Where Jambavan as well as Angada are leaders and Hanuma is an administrator, the progress 
of that work cannot be as otherwise."

Shlok 20: "It is so reported that Madhuvana has been destroyed by the heroes with Angada as the 
chief and the garden-guards who were together preventing the damage, were beaten up with knees."

Shlok 21: "To tell this matter in sweet words, the monkey renowned by Dadhimukha by name, with 
his celebrated prowess, has come here."

Shlok 22: "O the long-armed Lakshmana! Perceive the truth that Seetha has been seen and see that 
all monkeys, getting together, are drinking honey."

Shlok 23: "O Lakshmana, the foremost among men! If the renowned monkeys have not seen Seetha, they 
would not have abused the charming grove; which was granted as a boon."

Shlok 24- 25: Then, the righteous Lakshmana, together with Rama, felt delighted. Hearing the words 
coming from the mouth of Sugreeva, which were pleasant for the ears, Rama was rejoiced. The mighty Lakshmana 
too was very much rejoiced.

Shlok 26: Hearing those words of Dadhimukha, Sugreeva with a charming neck, was very much pleased 
and further spoke to Dadhimukha, the guardian of the grove (as follows):

Shlok 27: "I am happy that Madhuvana has been enjoyed by those monkeys, who have accomplished their 
act. Since the act (damage to the grove) done by those monkeys, who have accomplished their purpose 
is fit to be forgiven, I pardon them.

Shlok 28: "I, together with Rama and Lakshmana, soon desire to see those monkeys, with Hanuma as 
their chief, who having acquired the pride of a lion and who attained his purpose; and also to hear 
about their effort in finding out Seetha."

Shlok 29: Seeing Rama and Lakshmana with their eyes filled with ecstatic delight, the princes, 
who were thrilled with joy and who accomplished their aim, Sugreeva that king of the monkeys was very 
much delighted, knowing that accomplishment of their work is coming close to their hands and his limbs 
were thrilled with joy.



SARGA 64
------------------------------

[Text] Coming back to Madhuvana as instructed by Sugreeva, and craving forgiveness of Angada, 
Dadhimukha submits to him that he along with the other monkeys is urgently required by Sugreeva. Angada 
and other monkeys including Hanuma spring forward into the air towards Kishkindha. Even before the arrival 
of those monkeys, Sugreeva explains to Rama the valid reasons for concluding that Seetha has since been 
found. Angada, Hanuma and other, monkeys approach Sugreeva. Then, Hanuma apprises Rama of the discovery 
of Seetha. Hearing the news, Rama and Lakshmana were thrilled with joy and looked on Hanuma with a high 
esteem.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Dadhimukha the monkey was pleased and offered his salutation 
with reverence to Rama, Lakshmana

Shlok 2: After offering salutation to Sugreeva and to the mighty Rama and Lakshmana, that Dadhimukha 
accompanied by his valiant monkeys, sprang into the air.

Shlok 3: That Dadhimukha, after entering Madhuvana, saw all the chiefs of monkeys, who were free 
from their intoxication, having passed off the honey and who were inwardly excited.

Shlok 4: With his hands joined together for salutation, that valiant Dadhimukha approached them 
and cheerfully spoke the following gentle words to Angada.

Shlok 5: "O gentle sir! Due to their ignorance, these guards in anger obstructed you to enter 
the grove. No resentment should be harboured by you about this obstruction."

Shlok 6: "O exceedingly strong Angada! You are the prince and also the master of this grove. We 
have done a mistake

Shlok 7: "O faultless Angada! After going there, I indeed informed your uncle about the arrival 
of all these monkeys here."

Shlok 8: "Hearing your arrival along with these leaders of monkeys, your uncle was exceedingly 
pleased. Even after hearing of Madhuvana having been attacked, he did not develop any anger."

Shlok 9: "Sugreeva, your uncle, the lord of monkeys and the king was pleased and told me, 'send 
all the monkeys here'."

Shlok 10: Hearing these smooth words of Dadhimukha, the eloquent Angada, the foremost among the 
monkeys, spoke to those monkeys as follows:

Shlok 11: "O the foremost of monkeys, the tormentators of enemies! I assume that Rama might have 
heard the news (of our arrival). Hence, it is not proper for us to remain here any longer, now that 
our work has been accomplished."

Shlok 12: "The monkeys are taking, rest, after drinking the honey to their heart's content. What 
is there remaining, except to go to the place where Sugreeva my uncle is there?"

Shlok 13: "I shall do whatever all the leaders of monkeys together tell me. I am obedient to you, 
in the matter of what ought to be done."

Shlok 14: "I am not the master to command you, eventhough I am the crown prince. It is not befitting 
for me to play the lord over you, who have accomplished the task."

Shlok 15: Hearing the indeclinable words spoken thus by Angada, the monkeys with their pleased 
minds, spoke to him (as follows:

Shlok 16: "O prince, the foremost of monkeys! Who would speak like this, while he is the lord? 
Every one indeed thinks one's supremacy with an excited arrogance and says 'I, I'."

Shlok 17: "It is so worthy of you alone that you have spoken such words. None else can utter like 
this. Your humility itself is telling of your future suitableness for prosperity."

Shlok 18: "All of us, who reached here, are waiting for the right moment to go to that place where 
Sugreeva, the imperishable king of the heroic monkeys, is."

Shlok 19: "O the excellent of monkeys! Without your command, it is not possible for the monkeys 
anywhere, even a step forward. We are speaking this truth to you."

Shlok 20: While they were thus speaking; Angada replied, "Let us go." The mighty monkeys then sprang 
into the air.

Shlok 21: All those leaders of monkey-troops, like stones shot from a catapult, making the space 
space-less, followed Angada, who was springing forward.

Shlok 22: Those monkeys with speed, sounding forth a loud noise, sprang into the sky, like clouds 
driven by the wind.

Shlok 23: Even before Angada landed there, Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spoke to the louts-eyed 
Rama, who was afflicted with grief (as follows):

Shlok 24: "Be pacified! Happiness to you! The princess has been seen. There is not doubt. When 
the time earlier fixed by us exceeds beyond limit, it is not possible for them to come here."

Shlok 25: "Angada, the long-armed prince and the most excellent of monkeys does not make his appearance 
before my vicinity, if the work is ruined."

Shlok 26: "Even if such an exploit may be possible by these monkeys who have not been able to accomplish 
their work, Angada would have worn a sad face and felt perplexed and scattered in mind."

Shlok 27: "If Angada the lord f the monkeys is not rejoiced, he would not have damaged my madhuvana, 
which belongs to my father and grandfather as well as protected by my forbears. Get consoled well, O 
virtuous Rama, the splendid son of Kausalya!"

Shlok 28: "Seetha was seen. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen Seetha. There 
is indeed none other than Hanuma, who is the executor."

Shlok 29: "O Rama, having a very good understanding! In Hanuma, qualities like capacity to accomplish 
any object, intelligence, strenuous effort and vigour are unchangeable, like a splendour in the sun."

Shlok 30: "Where Jambavan is a leader; Angada as the commander of troops and moreover Hanuma as 
the administer, the progress of that work cannot be as otherwise."

Shlok 31- 32: "O Rama, of unlimited prowess! Do not encounter troubled thoughts now!" Meanwhile, when 
the monkeys, who are proud of Hanuma's performance and who are making noise as though they are proclaiming 
about the accomplishment of their act are approaching Kishkindha Sugreeva heard certain sounds expressing 
joy, in the vicinity of the sky."

Shlok 33: Then, hearing that clamour of the monkeys, Sugreeva the chief of the monkeys became rejoiced 
at heart, duly stretching and curling up his tail (in joy).

Shlok 34: Keeping Angada and Hanuma in front of them, those monkeys too arrived with their eagerness 
to see Rama.

Shlok 35: Those heroes, having Angada as their chief, exceedingly pleased as they were and filled 
with joy, landed at the vicinity of Sugreeva and Rama.

Shlok 36: Thereafter, the mighty armed Hanuma, offering his salutation in bending his head low, 
informed Rama that Seetha the princess is constant in devotion to Rama and sound in body.

Shlok 37: Hearing the nectar-like words, saying "Seetha was found" from the mouth of Hanuma, Rama 
and Lakshmana felt happy.

Shlok 38: Thereupon, Lakshmana with love looked with reverence on the joyful Sugreeva, who earlier 
decidedly apprised about the aforesaid Hanuma, having accomplished the task.

Shlok 39: Rama, the annihilator of hostile heroes, who obtained a great joy, looked on Hanuma with 
a high esteem.

[Text] Angada, Hanuma and other monkeys approach Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva at Mount Prasravana. 
When monkeys start narrating the news of Seetha, Rama asks further details of Seetha. Then, the monkeys 
request Hanuma to explain the occurrences to Rama in detail. Then, Hanuma appraises Rama of Seetha's 
presence at the foot of a Simsupa tree in the midst of female-demons. After narrating the incidents 
related by her and delivering to Rama the jewel for the head, earlier handed-over by Seetha as a token, 
Hanuma conveys her message to Rama.

Shlok 1- 2: Keeping Angada the prince in their forefront those monkeys, on reaching Mount Prasravana 
having forests of variegated appearance, offered their salutation by bowing their heads in reverence 
to Rama and the mighty Lakshmana, greeting Sugreeva respectfully. Then, they started narrating the news 
of Seetha.

Shlok 3: Those monkeys started to narrate, in the presence of Rama, about, the female-demons, 
and frightening Seetha in Ravana's gynaecium, her complete affection towards Rama and the time-limit 
of two months given by Ravana.

Shlok 4- 5: Hearing of Seetha being alive, Rama on his part replied, "Where is Seetha, the princess? 
How is she disposed towards me? O monkeys! Tell me all that about Seetha."

Shlok 6: Hearing the words of Rama, the monkeys urged Hanuma to tell, in the presence of Rama, 
all the incidents because he knew them better, about Seetha.

Shlok 7: Hearing the words of those monkeys, the eloquent Hanuma, the son of wind-god saluting 
towards the direction of the Seetha the princess by bowing his head, spoke the following words, explaining 
how he saw Seetha.

Shlok 8: "Having gone across the ocean, a hundred Yojanas wide, I reached the southern shore looking 
in search of Seetha, Janaka's daughter, with a wish to see her."

Shlok 9: "There at the southern shore of the southern ocean, there is city called Lanka of the 
evil-minded Ravana."

Shlok 10: "O Rama! There, living in Ravana's gynaecium in the city, I saw the lady Seetha, your 
virtuous wife, centering her heart's desire in you."

Shlok 11: "In that pleasure garden, I saw Seetha sitting in the midst of female demons, guarded 
by those ugly-faced female-demons as also time and again being threatened by them."

Shlok 12- 13- 14: "O hero! Seetha, who deserves to live happily with you, is obtaining grief. O Rama! I 
somehow searched that princess, Seetha wearing a single plait (as a as a mark of desolation), looking 
miserable, remaining absorbed in your thought, reposing on the floor, having discoloured limbs like 
a lotus in winter, turning back the wish from Ravana, having determined to die, but thinking of you 
alone."

Shlok 15: "O faultless tiger among men! Seetha established confidence in me, after I slowly described 
to her the fame of Ikshvaku dynasty."

Shlok 16- 17: "Thereafter, I spoke and explained to Seetha, about the entire significance of my arrival 
there. On hearing about the alliance between Rama and Sugreeva, she was quite pleased. Her morality 
as well as her devotion in you are steadfast."

Shlok 18: "O, the foremost of men! I thus saw that illustrious Seetha, endowed with severe penance 
and devotion towards you."

Shlok 19: "O Rama, of great intelligence! To me, she gave as a token of remembrance, a previous 
event of a crow occurred at your vicinity in Mount Chitrakuta."

Shlok 20: "Seetha spoke to me saying, 'O Hanuma! Inform Rama, the foremost among men, all that 
you have seen here."

Shlok 21: "While Sugreeva is hearing nearby and while you are telling the words in this way, let 
this jewel, which is deliberately well-guarded, be given to Rama."

Shlok 22: "This beautiful jewel for the head has been well-guarded by me. You also ought to recall 
a mark indeed painted by you (by slip) on the curve of my cheek with powder of an orange-red rock, when 
my former mark on my forehead got effaced."

Shlok 23: "This beautiful jewel, which has its origin in sea-water, has been sent to you. Seeing 
this in my grief, I am feeling always happy as though I am seeing you."

Shlok 24: "O Rama! I shall be sustaining my life for a month. Having come into the control of demons, 
I cannot survive beyond one month."

Shlok 25: "Seetha, with her emaciated body, practicing virtue, confined in Ravana's gynaecium and 
with her wide-open eyes like that of a doe, spoke to me the following words:

Shlok 26: "O Rama! I have narrated to you whatever has occurred, in its entirety. Let a bridge 
be constructed, by all means, across the waters of the ocean."

Shlok 27: Coming to know that the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana have become confident and having 
given that token of remembrance to Rama, Hanuma apprised completely in so many words, in regular succession, 
all that was conveyed by Seetha, the princess.



SARGA 66
------------------------------

[Text] Rama, presses the jewel for the head, dispatched by Seetha on his bosom and speaks to 
Sugreeva, telling him that by seeing that excellent jewel he obtains the sight of Seetha, her father 
and father-in-law. Rama urges Hanuma, to repeat the words spoken by Seetha.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of Hanuma, Rama the son of Dasaratha, having Lakshmana by his side, 
pressing that jewel on his bosom, began to weep.

Shlok 2: Seeing that excellent jewel, Rama emaciated with grief, having his eyes filled with tears, 
spoke to Sugreeva as follows:

Shlok 3: "Even as a cow, who is affectionate towards her offspring, gushes forth the milk (from 
her teats) due to her love at the very sight of her calf, so does my heart too melt through the sight 
of this excellent jewel."

Shlok 4: "This excellent jewel was presented by my father-in-law to Seetha when she had become 
a bride and was tied to her head in such a way that it looked additionally beautifying."

Shlok 5: "The jewel, which was found in the waters and recommended by the good, had been presented 
to him earlier by the intelligent Indra the lord of celestials, who was highly pleased in Yajna, a sacrificial 
rite (intended to propitiate him)."

Shlok 6: "O gentle Sugreeva! Seeing now this excellent jewel, I am considering it as surely as 
obtaining the sight of my father as well as Janaka, the king of Videha."

Shlok 7: "This jewel indeed looks splendid on the head of my beloved Seetha. By seeing this now, 
I am considering as though I obtained the sight of Seetha herself."

Shlok 8: "O gentle one! Repeat again and again, what Seetha the daughter of Videha's king said 
to you, sprinkling me with your stream of words, like offering water to a thirsty person."

Shlok 9: "O Lakshmana! What could be more painful than the fact that I am seeing this jewel found 
in waters, without the arrival of Seetha?"

Shlok 10: "O gentle one! If Seetha can survive for a month, it means that she is surviving for 
long. O gentle one! Without that black-eyed Seetha, I cannot survive for even a moment."

Shlok 11: "Take me too to that place where my beloved Seetha has been seen. I cannot halt even 
for a moment, after receiving the news of her location."

Shlok 12: "How does Seetha, my virtuous wife with her charming limbs, who is very shy, stay all 
the time with demons who are terrific and cruel?"

Shlok 13: "Her countenance, surely like automnal moon, though liberated of darkness, but screened 
by clouds, does not shine at present."

Shlok 14: "O Hanuma! Tell me now, correctly what Seetha told you. I shall surely survive, by hearing 
her words, even as a sick man would with the help of a medicine."

Shlok 15: "Tell me, what my beautiful consort, who is sweet-natured, and who utters sweet words, 
having fine hips and has been separated from me, said to you."



SARGA 67
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma narrates at length an incident connected with a crow that occured during the sojourn 
of Seetha with Rama at Chitrakuta, which was related by Seetha by way of a token of remembrance. Seetha 
then describes her miserable state to Hanuma and requests him to ask Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva to 
came to Lanka to destroy Ravana together with his army. Hanuma consoles Seetha, saying that Rama and 
Lakshmana would reduce Lanka to ashes and take her back to Ayodhya. When Hanuma further requests Seetha 
to give a token of remembrance to be handed over to Rama, she gives him a jewel for the head as a token.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of the high-souled Rama, Hanuma reported to Rama, all the words spoken 
by Seetha.

Shlok 2: "O Rama the foremost of men! Seetha, the princess, spoke a detailed account of an event 
which occurred long ago in Mount Chitrakuta, as a token of recollection."

Shlok 3: "Seetha, who slept happily by your side (at one instance) got up before you. A crow coming 
down quickly, tore her flesh at an area in the midst of her breasts (with its beak)."

Shlok 4: "O Rama! You slept in your turn on the lap of the princess. That crow again began to 
torment the princess."

Shlok 5: "Coming near again and again, it tore her breast severely. Dampened by her blood, you 
then were awakened by her."

Shlok 6: "O tormentator of enemies! Though lying happily asleep, you were awakened by Seetha the 
princess, who was being ceaselessly tormented by the crow."

Shlok 7: "O long-armed Rama! Seeing her, who was lacerated at the midst of her breasts, you were 
enraged like a hissing snake and spoke to her as follows."

Shlok 8: " 'O bashful Seetha! By whom was the middle of your breasts lacerated with nail-points? 
Who is playing with an angry five-hooded serpent?"

Shlok 9: "Looking around, you suddenly saw a crow, which perched in front of Seetha, with its 
sharp nails stained with blood."

Shlok 10: "That crow, foremost of the birds was indeed the son of Indra the lord of celestials; 
dwelling in the middle of the mountains and equal in speed to the wind."

Shlok 11: "O great armed Rama, the excellent among the wise! With your eyes rolling with anger, 
you then harboured a cruel intention against that crow."

Shlok 12: "Taking a blade of grass from your bed of the sacred grass, you charged it with the potency 
of Brahma missile. That flaming blade blazed forth like the fire of universal dissolution, with its 
end facing the bird."

Shlok 13: "You hurled that flaming blade of grass towards the crow. Then that flaming blade of 
grass for its part followed the crow."

Shlok 14: "Forsaken by all the celestials, Indra, its father and the sages too, that crow did not 
find a protector even after going round all the three worlds (heaven, earth and the lower regions)."

Shlok 15: "O destroyer of enemies! Being frightened the crow came to your presence once again and 
sough your protection. Though fit to be killed, you on your part, affording shelter, in mercy to the 
crow, protected that crow which had fallen flat on the ground."

Shlok 16: 'O Rama! Since it is not possible to make the missile a waste, you destroyed the right 
eye of the crow."

Shlok 14: "O Rama! Then, that crow, having been discharged by you, went back to its own habitation, 
after offering salutation to you and to king Dasaratha."

Shlok 18: "O Rama! Why are you not employing the same type of a missile on the demons, though you 
are the foremost among the wielders of missiles, though courageous and possessed of good disposition?"

Shlok 19: "Neither the Nagas the celestials serpents nor even Gandharvas the celestial musicians 
nor the demons nor the troop of Maruts the host of gods, nor all of them joined together are capable 
of fighting with Rama."

Shlok 20: "If that powerful Rama is eager to save me, let him kill Ravana in battle quickly with 
his exceptionally sharp arrows."

Shlok 21: "Why even that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries and the foremost of men born 
in Raghu dynasty is not saving me, by taking orders from Rama his brother?"

Shlok 22: "Wherefore those two competent brothers Rama and Lakshmana, with their splendour equal 
to that of air and fire, and excellent among men, even though they can conquer the celestials, are ignoring 
me?"

Shlok 23: "There is no doubt that I had done some big impure act, for which reason those two brothers 
Rama and Lakshmana, who torment the enemies, even though capable, are not paying attention to me."

Shlok 24: Hearing the miserable words of Seetha spoken with tears, I again spoke to that venerable 
Seetha the following words:

Shlok 25: " 'O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown indifferent because of grief born of separation 
from you. I swear it to you truly. Rama, being overwhelmed with grief, Lakshmana too is feeling pain."

Shlok 26: " 'O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize 
and which can beget happiness to him."

Shlok 27: " 'Those two princes, the foremost among men and the faultless ones are eager to see 
you. They can reduce Lanka to ashes'."

Shlok 28: " 'O lady with charming hips! Killing the terrific Ravana together with his relatives 
in battle, Rama will certainly take you to his City of Ayodhya'."

Shlok 29: " 'O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize 
and which can beget happiness to him."

Shlok 30: "O mighty Rama! Having surveyed all the directions and having untied from the end of 
her garment, this excellent jewel which was being strung together in her hair that Seetha gave it to 
me."

Shlok 31: "O Rama! Taking that wonderful jewel for your sake from her, and offering my salutation 
by bowing my head to that venerable Seetha, I was seized with a haste to come back."

Shlok 32: "Seeing me who was in a hurry to come back and augmenting my body abundantly, Seetha 
having a beautiful complexion spoke to me."

Shlok 33: "With her eyes filled with tears, looking miserable, with her words ambiguously coming 
out of her coked throat, bewildered as she was, at the though of my flying away and afflicted with a 
gush of grief; (she spoke to me as follows):

Shlok 34: "O Hanuma! Inquire those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana looking like lions, Sugreeva 
together with his ministers and all others about their welfare."

Shlok 35: " 'You ought to clear up difficulties for that mighty armed Rama, so that he can help 
me to cross this ocean of sorrow. O best of heroes among monkeys! Approaching Rama, tell this horrible 
gush of my grief and the threats of these female-demons. Have a happy journey!' "O illustrious princes, 
the protector of men! The venerable Seetha filled with sorrow spoke these words to be conveyed to you. 
Comprehending this matter spoken by me, believe that Seetha is completely safe."



SARGA 68
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma informs Rama how Seetha expressed her grave doubt as to how monkeys and bears 
can leap across a vast sea, as well as her appeal to Rama to destroy Ravana along with his entire army 
in Lanka and take her back to Ayodhya. Hanuma further informs Rama, how he resolved her doubt by explaining 
the prowess of the troops of monkeys and bears, commanded by Sugreeva as also how he brought solace 
and peace to her from her worries.

Shlok 1: "O excellent among men! Having shown respect for me out of her affection and good-heartedness 
for you, I, who was in a haste to go, was spoken to again by Seetha the princess about the further course 
of action."

Shlok 2: "Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is to be informed by you thus in several ways, for quickly 
killing Ravana in battle and also as to how he can get me back."

Shlok 3: " 'O hero the annihilator of enemies! If you deem it fit, stay for a day in a secret 
place. You can go tomorrow after taking rest'."

Shlok 4: "'O the valiant one! Because of your presence, the termination of my full-blown grief 
may continue for a while'."

Shlok 5: "'When you, the courageous one, have actually left to come back, there will be a danger 
even to my life. There is no doubt about this'."

Shlok 6: "'The sorrow born of your disappearance will further torment me, who is overtaken by 
one sorrow after another, miserable and doomed to grief as I am'."

Shlok 7: "'O best among the monkeys! O valiant one! In the matter of monkeys and bears who are 
your helpmates, this very grave doubt stands before me'."

Shlok 8: "'How indeed can those troops of monkeys and bears or Rama and Lakshmana can cross that 
great insurmountable ocean?'"

Shlok 9: "'Three beings viz. Garuda the eagle, or yourself or the wind-god only have the capacity 
of crossing this ocean'."

Shlok 10: "'O valiant monkey! That is why, what strategy are you visualizing to fulfill this act, 
which is so difficult to accomplish thus? You are indeed excellent of those who know how to accomplish 
any work'."

Shlok 11: "O Hanuma the annihilator of hostile enemies! You, as one alone, are capable of fulfilling 
this task. Your act of fulfilling this task your act of fulfilling the result is well-known."

Shlok 12: ""It would result in his glory, if Rama, after killing Ravana along with his entire army, 
takes me to his city in his victory'."

Shlok 13: "'Rama ought not to take me back for fear that Ravana, in the same manner as Ravana the 
demon took me away from the forest in the absence of Rama by cheating that heroic Rama."

Shlok 14: If Rama, the destroyer of rival army, fills the entire Lanka with arrows and takes me 
home, it will be quite worthy of him."

Shlok 15: "For that reason, you act in such a way, that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, 
exhibits the prowess befitting of him."

Shlok 16: "Hearing that appeal (of Seetha), that was somewhat good in its meaning, courteous and 
duly furnished with reasons, I gave then my remaining reply (as follows):

Shlok 17: "'O Seetha the princess! Sugreeva, the lord of the troops of monkeys and bears, excellent 
among the monkeys and endowed with strength, is firmly determined to rescue you."

Shlok 18- 19: "So many monkeys, endowed with prowess, perseverance great strength and who can rush 
to any place as they wish, are intensely committed to Sugreeva's command. There is no hindrance to their 
movement either in the sky or the ground or in a horizontal region between the sky and the ground. Those 
monkeys with unlimited splendour are not indolent in performing any great task."

Shlok 20: "Those illustrious monkeys, proud of their strength and following the path of wind, circumambulated 
the entire earth several times."

Shlok 21- 22: "'In them, some of the monkeys are superior to me and some are even equal to me. No one 
in the vicinity of Sugreeva is inferior to me. When I have arrived here, why to talk about those mighty 
ones? Generally, superior ones are not sent for errands. Only others are indeed sent'."

Shlok 23: "'O Seetha the princess! Enough of your lamentation. Take away your sorrow. Those leaders 
of monkeys will reach Lanka by one single leap'."

Shlok 24: "Rama and Lakshmana, those two lions among men, also of great strength, ascending on 
my shoulders, can come to you, like the rising sun and the moon."

Shlok 25: "Rama, the annihilator of enemies, similar to a lion, and Lakshmana wielding a bow in 
his hand, will surely approach the entrance-gate of Lanka and you will see them soon."

Shlok 26: "'You can see soon those valiant monkeys, with their claws and tusks as weapons, having 
the prowess of lions and tigers and looking like lordly elephants, coming here together'."

Shlok 27: "'You will hear within a short time, the clamour of the excellent of monkeys resonating 
like a mountains and clouds, on the peaks of Mount Malaya in Lanka'."

Shlok 28: "'You will see Rama, the annihilator of enemies, returning from exile, and getting anointed 
to the crown in Ayodhya, along with you soon'."

Shlok 29: "Thereafter, soothened by me with comforting, well-disposed and agreeable words, Seetha, 
though tormented with thought of your grief, obtained peace of mind."

SARGA 1
------------------------------

[Text] Rama appreciates Hanuma and embraces him after hearing his report.Rama was gladdend
that Hanuma did something worthy of a noble servent. Then, Rama reflected upon the problem of how
to cross the ocean.

Shlok 1: Touched with joy to hear the words rightly spoken by Hanuman, Rama replied as
follows: -

Shlok 2: "A very outstanding work, the most arduous in the world has been done by Hanuman,
which could not be carried out even in thought by any other on the surface of this earth."

Shlok 3: "Indeed, I cannot perceive as such anyone other than Garuda (chief of the feathered
race and vehicle of Lord Vishnu), wind- god and Hanuman, who can cross the mighty ocean."

Shlok 4: "Who can return alive, having entered (once) taking refuge only in self- command,
the city of Lanka, which is unconquerable by gods demons and Yakshas and even by Gandharvas, Nagas
and ogres and well under the custody of Ravana?"

Shlok 5: "Who is able to capture that citadel, by assault, that is exceedingly dangerous to
be attacked and which is powerfully guarded by ogres, but one whose courage and valour are equal to
Hanuman's?"

Shlok 6: "A great act of service has been done by Hanuman to Sugriva thus by exhibiting his
strength corresponding to his pace."

Shlok 7: "That servant to whom his master entrusts a difficult task and who performs it with
zeal is said to be a superior person."

Shlok 8: "The one who is ready and capable but who yet does no more than his master extracts
from him is called a mediocre person."

Shlok 9: "The one who is well and able and yet does not carry out the instructions of his
master as directed is said to be the least of men ."

Shlok 10: "Through the discovery of Sita's retreat by this faithful messenger, Hanuman has
fulfilled the task entrusted to him unfalteringly to the satisfaction of Sugriva and hence there
was no diminution to his self."

Shlok 11: "By finding out Sita, the Raghu dynasty as well as myself and the valiant Lakshmana
too, have been rightly saved today."

Shlok 12: "But it squeezes my conscience further, hopeless as I am, to think that I am not
able to do a pleasant act befittingly to the bearer of these good tidings."

Shlok 13: "Let me at least embrace this magnanimous Hanuman since in the present
circumstances, this is all that is easily obtained from me."

Shlok 14: Thus saying, Rama vibrating with joy, clasped Hanuman in his arms who, master of
himself, his mission fulfilled, had returned.

Shlok 15: After reflecting a while, Rama the great scion of Raghus, again spoke as follows,
Sugriva the ruler of monkeys too listening attentively.

Shlok 16: "The search for Sita has been performed so much well in all ways. But my mind gets
dejected once more, when I behold this vast ocean."

Shlok 17: How can these monkeys put together will reach the southern bank of the ocean, which
is so difficult to cross and which contains voluminous water?"

Shlok 18: "Having received the tidings of Sita, what can now be done to take the monkeys to
the farther side the sea?"

Shlok 19: Thus speaking to Hanuman, Rama the destroyer of enemies and the mighty armed, was
filled with apprehension and then became absorbed in thought.



SARGA 2
------------------------------

[Text] Sugreeva comforts Rama, who is tormented with grief, asking him to keep away from
apprehensive mind and to think of ways and means to cross the ocean.

Shlok 1: The glorious Sugreeva made the following reply, which was intended to expel his
grief, to Rama the son of Dasaratha who felt miserable with anguish.

Shlok 2: "Oh, hero! Why are you lamenting thus, as any other ordinary man? Do not be
sorrowful like this. Abandon your grief, as an ungrateful man abandons friendship."

Shlok 3: "As the information about Seetha has since been gathered, I do not indeed see any
scope for your grief Oh, Rama!"

Shlok 4: "Oh, Rama! You are a wise person, a knower of sacred works, an intellectual and a
learned man. Give up these ordinary apprehensions like a man whose spirit is disciplined gives up
ideas which spoil the purpose.

Shlok 5: "We shall make our way up to Lanka, by crossing the ocean filled with large
crocodiles. We shall destroy your enemy."

Shlok 6: "All action get dissipated by a person who is non-enthusiastic, depressed and
disturbed with grief. Such a person gets into troubles too."

Shlok 7: "These leaders of monkey squads are gallant and efficient in all ways. They are
enthusiastic even to enter a fire for your sake. I understand this from their joy and my reasoning
too is sound."

Shlok 8: "You ought to act in every way that I may be able to get back Seetha, after
destroying by an attack the enemy Ravana of sinful deeds."

Shlok 9: "You take steps in such a way that a bridge is constructed across the sea and we
reach that city of the king of ogres."

Shlok 10: "Be certain that Ravana is killed, once he is seen in a battle and on our seeing
that city of Lanka standing on a peak of the Trikuta Mountain."

Shlok 11: "Without building a bridge across the sea, the dreadful abode of Varuna (the god of
water), Lanka cannot be defeated even by gods and demons including Indra."

Shlok 12-13: "Know that when the whole of my army crosses the sea as a bridge is built across it,
they will come out victorious, because these monkeys who are able to change their form at will are
indeed valiant in battle."

Shlok 14: "Therefore, take away your apprehensive mind, which destroys any enterprise for
grief in this world diminishes the might of a man, Oh king!"

Shlok 15: ï¿½Cling to the practice of boldness, ought to be resorted to by a man. It will
produce competence without doubt to the doer quickly."

Shlok 16: "Prevail upon the strength with alertness at this moment, Oh highly intelligent
prince! Grief for something lost or destroyed consumes all resources of even the strong and
magnanimous men like you."

Shlok 17: "You are the foremost among the intelligent and the knower of all sacred texts.
Hence, you ought to defeat the enemy, with allies like me."

Shlok 18: "I do not indeed see any one who can withstand you in a battle filed in the three
worlds, when you are armed with a bow, Oh Rama!"

Shlok 19: "You work duly entrusted to the monkeys will not be spoiled. You shall behold Seetha
era imperishable sea."

Shlok 20: "Oh, Lord of the earth! Desist from this melancholy. Yield to your legitimate
indignation. Unadventurous Kshatriyas (members of warrior-tribe) never win honor but all fear the
wrathful."

Shlok 21: "You with your resourceful mind, along with us together, ponder over now a design to
cross the sea, the terrible Lord of rivers."

Shlok 22: "Know victory to be certain, once the sea has been crossed by the army. Verily when
all my forces have passed over the sea our triumph is assured!"

Shlok 23: "These monkeys, the courageous soldiers who are able to change their form at their
volition, will crush their opponents with an avalanche of rocks and trees."

Shlok 24: "Once we have crossed the sea (the abode of Varuna) by whatever the means employed,
Ravana is as definitely killed in my eyes, Oh exterminator of enemies!"

Shlok 25: What is the use of all these words? By all means, you will be a victorious man. I
see good omens and my heard is over thrilled with joy."



SARGA 3
------------------------------

[Text] On hearing the words of Sugreeva, Rama requests Hanuma to describe Lanka in detail.
Hanuma gives a detailed description of Lanka as he saw it.

Shlok 1: Hearing the well-founded and highly reasonable words of Sugreeva, Rama concurred
with him and spoke then to Hanuma as follows:

Shlok 2: "I am competent of crossing this ocean by all means, either by way of austerity or
by forming a bridge or by drying up the ocean."

Shlok 3: "Tell me how many citadels in Lanka are difficult of access, Oh, Hanuma! I desire to
know all that, as though viewed with an eye."

Shlok 4-5: "You had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the size of the army, the
fortification-details of the gates and citadels, the way in which Lanka was guarded and the various
mansions of ogres. Describe everything in accordance with facts, for you are skilled in all
ways."

Shlok 6: Hearing the words of Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who was excellent in the art
of expression, forthwith spoke once more to Rama as follows:

Shlok 7: "Listen to me! I shall tell you everything-how the city of Lanka has been defended
by the various methods of fortification and how it has been guarded by the troops."

Shlok 8-9: "I shall tell you the details of how the ogres are attached to their king, the
excellent prosperity of Lanka generated by the glory of Ravana, the awfulness of the ocean, the
division of the body of his forces and of animals like horses and elephants carrying his forces
other than the infantry." Saying so, Hanuma the foremost among monkeys, who knew the truth narrated
as follows.

Shlok 10: "The great Lanka was rejoiced and gayful, full of elephants in rut, abounding in
chariots and inhabited by gangs of ogres."

Shlok 11: "Four fairly big and extensive gates are fitted with strong doors along with huge
beams for locking those gates."

Shlok 12: "Strong and mighty ballista capable of hurling darts and stones have been attached
to them. The enemy troops which arrive there are warded off by those catapults at the very
gates."

Shlok 13: "Dangerous and sharp edged Sataghnis made of iron, forged by hordes of ogres, have
been kept in readiness in hundreds at the gates.

[Commentary] Comment: Sataghnis are four forearms in length bristled with iron spikes and are
so called because they are supposed to kill hundreds at a time.

Shlok 14: "A great rampart made of gold, which is difficult to assail with violence and is
inlaid at intervals with gems, corals, cat's eyes and pearls, encircle that Lanka."

Shlok 15: "Most awe-inspiring and fathomless moats (deep trenches) of great splendor, filled
with cold water, infested with alligators and inhabited by fishes are there all round the
city."

Shlok 16: "Anterior to the gateways, there are four very extensive draw-bridges, equipped with
numerous engines and furnished with many rows of buildings (built on the rampart and meant for
those entrusted with the duty of guarding the entrances)."

Shlok 17: "Against the approach of the enemy forces there, the draw-bridges are protected by
the aforesaid engines and the enemy-battalions are flung into the moats on every side."

Shlok 18: "The most important draw-bridge which is unshakable, firmly fastened very well and
strong, is dazzling with numerous gold pillars and pedestals."

Shlok 19: "Ravana, inclined to war and endowed with powers of the state, himself remains alert
and in readiness to review the forces, Oh, Rama!"

[Commentary] Seven powers of the state are usually enumerated, viz. king, minister, allies,
treasure, army, territory and fortresses.

Shlok 20: "Lanka therefore is impregnable, it is a celestial citadel, that inspires terror.
Surrounded by water and built on a mountain, it has four fold defenses including forest and
artificial fortification."

[Commentary] Comment: Fourfold defences, defence by water, mountain, forest or by artificial
means.

Shlok 21: "Lanka is situated on the other side of the ocean, which is difficult of access, Oh
Rama! It offers no passage for vehicles either and there is no proper communication from all
sides."

Shlok 22: "That city of Lanka, resembling the city of Gods, is built on a mountain peak and is
inaccessible. That Lanka is abound with horses and elephants and is extremely difficult to
conquer."

Shlok 23: Deep trenches and Sataghnis too as well as engines of war of every kind adorn Lanka
the city of wicked Ravana."

Shlok 24: "Ten thousand ogres all carrying darts in their hands and warriors contending with
swords, who are difficult to assail, are positioned at the eastern gate."

Shlok 25: "One hundred thousand of ogres, with an army of four limbs (viz. horses, foot
soldiers, elephants and chariots) are positioned at the southern gate of the city. Warriors
unsurpassed by others constitute that army."

Shlok 26: One million troops arrived with shields and swords as well as proficient in the use
of all mystic missiles, are positioned at the western gate."

Shlok 27: "A hundred millions of ogres, who are mounted in chariots or who ride on hoses, sons
of distinguished families and greatly honored, are positioned there at the northern gate."

Shlok 28: "Moreover, ogres hundreds of thousands in number, difficult to attack, aggregating
to one and quarter of a crore of ogres are positioned at the central division."

Shlok 29: "Those bridges were broken by me and the moats were filled up (with the wreckage).
The city of Lanka was burnt by me and the defensive walls were pulled down. A part of the army of
the gigantic ogres was destroyed."

Shlok 30: "By some way or other, let us cross the ocean. The city of Lanka should be assumed
then as destroyed by the monkeys."

Shlok 31-32-33: "Oh, Rama! What is the use for the rest of the forces to you? Angada, Divida,
Mainda, Jambavan, Panasa, Anala and Nila the commander-in-chief alone, by reaching that great city
of Ravana leaping and storming Lanka with its mountains and woods, moats and archways, protective
walls and buildings, will recover Seetha."

Shlok 34: "Order quickly to get all the forces accumulated accordingly. Let us set out at the
appropriate moment."



SARGA 4
------------------------------

[Text] After hearing the report of Hanuma, Rama fixes an auspicious hour for the departure of 
his forces to Lanka and perceives good omens. The Army reaches the shores of the sea.

Shlok 1: Rama, a very bright man and a true warrior, having duly heard the words of Hanuman from 
the beginning, thereafter spoke as follows:

Shlok 2: "I shall destroy quickly Lanka, the city of that terrible ogre (Ravana), of which you 
just informed I am really telling this."

Shlok 3: "Be pleased to approve our march at this moment, a suitable moment for success. The sun 
reached the mid-day.

Shlok 4: "Let that ogre go (to his abode) after kidnapping Seetha. Where will he go alive? Hearing 
of my march to Lanka, Seetha will get back her hope in life, like a sick man having drunk poison touches 
ambrosia at the end of his life."

Shlok 5: "This northern planet of Phalguni will be in conjunction with the Hasta star tomorrow. 
Hence, let us depart today itself with all the troops accompanying us, Oh, Sugreeva!"

Shlok 6: "By seeing the omens which are becoming visible, I deduce that I shall bring back Seetha 
the daughter of Janaka, by killing Ravana."

Shlok 7: "My eye which is twitching on the upper lid, is proclaiming as it were, my desire of 
victory coming nearer."

Shlok 8: Then Rama the virtuous man versed in moral law, who was well-adored by Sugreeva the king 
of monkeys and Lakshmana, again spoke as follows:-

Shlok 9: "Let general Nila accompanied by strength of hundred thousand warriors go before the 
army, to explore the way."

Shlok 10: "Oh Nila the chief of Army! Steer the army speedily by the path, abound with fruits and 
roots, cool woods and fresh water and honey."

Shlok 11: "The evil-minded demons may spoil the roots, fruits and water in the path-way. You always 
try to be on you guard."

Shlok 12: "Let the monkeys jump into law grounds, into places made inaccessible by forest-grores 
and into thickets and notice whether any rival forces are stationed there."

Shlok 13: "Let whatever little of feeble forces stay back in Kishkindha, as our operation will 
indeed be dreadful. It has to be discharged daringly."

Shlok 14: "Let the best of monkeys with great strength in hundreds and thousands lead the formidable 
of the army, which is akin to an oceanic stream."

Shlok 15: "Let Gaja, equal to a mountain, Gavaya a very strong warrior and Gavaksha march in front, 
as a majestic bull marches in front of a cow-herd."

Shlok 16: "Let the monkey called Rishabha, Lord of the simians and the best of the primates march 
forward, duly guarding the right side of the army of the simians."

Shlok 17: "Let Gandhamadana, with a strength unconquerable like an elephant in rut, proceed duly 
guarding the left side of the army of monkeys."

Shlok 18: "I myself, mounted on the shoulders of Hanuman, like Indra on Airavata, will march in 
the centre of my troops, duly cheering the multitude of army."

Shlok 19: "Let this Lakshmana, resembling the lord of Death, march on the shoulders of Angada like 
Kubera the lord of riches and the sovereign of beings marches on an elephant called Sarvabhauma."

Shlok 20: Let the highly strong, Jambavan with Sushena and the monkey called Vegadarshi, all three, 
guard the middle part of the army."

Shlok 21: "Hearing the words of Rama, Sugreeva with great valour, the commander of forces and the 
lion among monkeys gave orders to the monkeys accordingly."

Shlok 22: Then, all those troops of monkeys with great speed together raised up and quickly bounced 
from caves and mountain-tops.

Shlok 23: Thereafter Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved 
towards southern direction, along with the army.

Shlok 24: At that time, Rama went surrounded by monkeys, looking like elephants, numbering in hundreds, 
hundreds of thousands and crores.

Shlok 25: That extensive army of monkeys followed Rama who was marching in the lead. All those 
monkeys maintained by Sugreeva were rejoicing with delight.

Shlok 26: The monkeys, jumping overwhelmingly with roaring sound and jest fully playing musical 
instruments (like trumpets) marched towards southern direction.

Shlok 27: They marched on, eating good-smelling honeys and fruits and carrying large branches bearing 
clusters of blossoms in multitude.

Shlok 28: Wild monkeys would lift up and throw one another all of a sudden. Some others were hanging 
down and flying upwards. Some other monkeys were throwing down others.

Shlok 29: Monkeys close to Rama were thus shouting, "To us, Ravana is worthy of killing and also 
the entire demons."

Shlok 30: Rishabha, Nila, and the courageous Kumuda along with many monkeys were clearing up the 
path ahead.

Shlok 31: Sugreeva the king of monkeys, Rama and Lakshmana the destroyers of enemies were moving 
in the centre along with many robust and terrible monkeys.

Shlok 32: The heroic monkey satabali who was accompanied by ten crores of monkeys, standing alone 
firmly, guarded the whole army of monkeys.

Shlok 33: Kesari with a retinue of a hundred crore, Panasa, Gaja and Arka along with many monkeys 
were protecting one flank of that army.

Shlok 34: Keeping Sugreeva in front, Sushena and Jambavanta surrounded by many bears, protected 
the hinder part of that army.

Shlok 35: Nila their chief of the army, the brave and the best among monkeys, the self controlled 
and the foremost among movable beings, was protecting atha army in every direction.

Shlok 36: Valimukha, Prajangha, Jambha and Rabhasa the monkey were moving on all sides, urging 
the monkeys forward.

Shlok 37-38: Those foremost among the monkeys, proud of their strength, thus marching with the army, 
saw the Sahya mountain the best of mountains joined with many small mountains, lakes fully abounding 
in flowers and eminent ponds.

Shlok 39-40: That large army of monkeys, terrific like an ocean-flood cognizing the command of Rama 
which is frightfully enraging, having terror-stricken, abandoning the vicinity of towns and even villages, 
marched like a highly dreadful ocean with a great hoaring sound.

Shlok 41: All those prominent and valiant monkeys were overwhelmingly jumping ahead, like fine 
horses being whipped, at the side of that Rama.

Shlok 42: Rama and Lakshmana the best among men being carried on shoulders by Hanuman and Angada 
the two monkeys, were effulgent like the moon and the sun having come together in contact with two large 
planets (Jupiter and Venus).

Shlok 43: Thereafter, Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved 
towards southern direction, along with the army. Lakshmana, with a fully meaningful presence of mind, 
sitting on Angada, spoke the following auspicious words which were fully meaningful, to Rama.

Shlok 45: "Killing Ravana fast and obtaining Seetha who was taken away, you will proceed to Ayodhya 
which is abundant by rich, having accomplished your purpose."

Shlok 46: "I am seeing all grand good omens in the sky and the earth self-evident of your fulfillment, 
Oh Rama! The wind which is favorable, gentle beneficial and comfortable to the army is blowing alongside."

Shlok 47: "These beasts and birds are uttering sonorous and sweet sounds. All the quarters are 
looking bright. Even the sun is clear."

Shlok 48-49: "The planet of Venus with its bright light, born from the sage Bhrigu (a mind-born son 
of Brahma the creator) is hanging behind you. Dhruva, the very bright pole-star (which is recognized 
by the contiguity of the stars presided over by the seven Brahmana sages) is becoming clear. All the 
pure great sages having bright light are shining are shining around Dhruva star.

Shlok 50: "The royal sage Trishanku, our paternal grand father, born in the high-souled Ikshvaku 
dynasty, is purely shining (as a star) in front, along with his family-priest."

Shlok 51: "Visakha stars are shining clearly without any evil influence. This supreme constellation 
is of our Ikshvakus, the high-souled."

Shlok 52: "The Mula constellation of the titans is badly aspected, in that it is touched by a comet 
risen with a tail of light and tormented by it."

Shlok 53: "All this has come for the destruction of the titans, for, the star seized by death is 
oppressed by a planet in its last hour."

Shlok 54: "The waters are crystal-clear, with good taste. The woodlands are laden with fruit. The 
fragrant air is not blowing much. Trees are bearing seasonal flowers."

Shlok 55: "The armies of monkeys formed into different squadrons are looking highly splendid like 
the armies of celestials in the battle in which the demon Taraka was killed, Oh venerable one! Be pleased 
to see these good omens in this manner."

Shlok 56-57: The delighted Lakshmana spoke thus, cheering up his brother. Then, the army of monkeys 
consisting of excellent bears and monkeys having their very nails and teeth as weapons, marched ahead, 
covering the entire earth.

Shlok 58-59: The aweful dust raised by nails and claws of monkeys obscured the splendor of the sun 
and also covered the earth comprising of mountains forests and the atmosphere. The colossal monkey-army 
advanced, encompassing the southern region like a mass of cloud enveloping the sky.

Shlok 60: While the army was crossing the entire river-currents uninterruptedly, the currents flowed 
invertedly for a distance of many yojanas.

Shlok 61: The mighty army entered thoroughly into lakes containing clear water, mountains full 
of trees, plain-landed territories and forests laden with fruits from the middle, from the four sides, 
from across and from under.

Shlok 62: The gigantic army marched, thoroughly covering the land. All of them with a wind-like 
aped went on, manifesting a joy in their faces.

Shlok 63-64: For the sake of Rama, the monkeys with fully elevated pace vied with each other in high 
spirits, vigor and prowess. Out of pride born of prime youth, some made various gestures on the way.

Shlok 65: Some wild monkeys there walked very speedily. In that manner, some others hovered highly. 
Some made noises, sounding "kila! kila!".

Shlok 66: Some monkeys lashed their tails. Some even stamped their feet. Some others, stretching 
their arms, broke off rocks and trees.

Shlok 67: Some monkeys ascended mountain-peaks and uttered huge noises. Some others made lion's 
roars.

Shlok 68: Some monkeys were crushing many webs of creepers by the jerks of their thighs. The valiant 
monkeys also played with rocks and trees, by stretching their limbs.

Shlok 69: In that place, the land was covered splendidly by hundreds of thousands, by thousands 
and crores of monkeys, who were looking very dreadful.

Shlok 70-71: That extensive monkey-army was marching day and night. All the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva 
were exceedingly pleased and cheerful. All were marching quickly, rejoicing for war. Those monkeys desirous 
of Seetha's release, did not halt even for a moment anywhere.

Shlok 72: Then, those monkeys reached and climbed up a mountain called sahya with a full canopy 
of trees and filled with many kinds of beasts.

Shlok 73: Rama too went along, seeing the wonderful woods, streams and cascades of Sahya and Malaya 
mountains.

Shlok 74: The monkeys enjoyed the fruits of Champaka, Tilaka, mango, Praseka, Sindnvaara Timisa 
and Karaveera trees.

Shlok 75: The monkeys enjoyed Ashoka, Karanja, Plaksa, Nyagrodha, Jambu, myrobalan and Naga trees.

Shlok 76: Various kinds of forest-trees standing on enchanting plateaus, being shaken by gust of 
winds, poured out flowers on those monkeys.

Shlok 77: A soft-touching breeze, refreshing as a sandal, blew while the bees hummed in the nectar-scented 
woods.

Shlok 78: That royal Sahya Mountain was highly adorned with red-coloured metal. The dust blown 
from that metal by the velocity of wind, coming forth from all sides, obscured the huge monkey-army.

Shlok 79-84: On the lovely mountain slopes, in blossom on all sides, Ketaki and Sindhuvara trees, 
the charming Vasanti, Madhavi creepers with flowers full of scent, clumps of jasmine, Chiribila, Madhuka, 
Vanjula and Vakula, Ranjanka and Tilaka, Nyavriksha all in flower, Mango, Patalike, Kovidara in flower, 
Muchulinda, Arjuna, Simsapa and Kutaja, Hintala, Timisa, Chirna and Nipa, blue Ashoka, Sarala, Ankola 
and Padmaka all these trees were crawled in excitement by the monkeys who were delighted.

Shlok 85-87: There were delightful wells with stairs and ponds in that mountain, sought after by chakravaka 
birds, frequented by karandava birds, crowded with water-fowls and cranes, visited by boars and deer, 
haunted on all sides by bears, hyenas, lions and many dreadful tigers. There were beautiful reservoirs 
of water with blossoming blue lotuses, water lilies, white water lilies, black water lilies and various 
other kinds of aquatic flowers.

Shlok 88-89: Various kinds of birds sang in those mountain-peaks. Monkeys bathed in water, drank those 
waters and played. They ascended the mountain and got drenched in water, by sprinkling water by one 
over the other among themselves.

Shlok 90: Monkeys in mad rut plucked sweet-smelling fruits, roots and flowers there.

Shlok 91: Those monkeys, in reddish brown colour like honey, drinking honey from honey-combs weighing 
about a maund each, went on cheerfully.

Shlok 92: Those foremost among the monkeys marched, breaking off trees, pulling along creepers 
and throwing away excellent mountains.

Shlok 93: Some other monkeys, well-pleased with honey got from trees, yelled loudly. Some others 
reached trees to get honey. Some others were drinking honey excessively.

Shlok 94: The earth filled with those excellent monkeys, was like land filled with ripened fields 
of paddy.

Shlok 95: Then, the lotus-eyed and the mighty-armed Rama reached Mahendra mountain and ascended 
its top, adorned with trees.

Shlok 96: Then, Rama the son of Dasartha mounted the peak and saw an ocean ruffled with water and 
scattered well with turtles and fishes.

Shlok 97: They crossed Sahya mountain and Malaya mountain and systematically approached the ocean 
having terrific sound.

Shlok 98: Rama the foremost of those who entrance the mind, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana 
quickly descended the mountain and went to the excellent woodland adjoining the sea.

Shlok 99: Then Rama reached the extensive ocean with rocks underneath washed by floods of water 
risen vehemently and spoke these words.

Shlok 100: "Oh, Sugreeva! We have reached the abode of Varuna. We should consider now the matter 
(of how to cross the ocean) with which we were formerly preoccupied."

Shlok 101: "This ocean, the lord of Rivers, is shore less beyond. This sea is impossible to be crossed 
without a proper strategy."

Shlok 102: "For this reason, let the military be assembled here only. Here, let us discuss the plan 
how this military of monkeys will reach the other shore."

Shlok 103: Rama, the mighty armed, emaciated due to taking away of Seetha, then reached the sea 
and ordered thus for the halt of the army there.

Shlok 104: "Let all the army be stationed at the sea-shore, Sugreeva! Here, the time has come for 
us to think about the subject of crossing the ocean."

Shlok 105: "Let not anyone slip away in any direction, leaving his respective unit of army. Let 
valiant monkeys make a more and it should be known whether there is a hidden danger for us."

Shlok 106: Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva along with Lakshmana made the army to halt at the sea-shore, 
stretched with trees.

Shlok 107: That army, stationed at the vicinity of the ocean, shined like a second ocean splendid 
with yellowish white honey-coloured water.

Shlok 108: There, those foremost of monkeys reached the woodlands at the shore and settled down, 
desiring to reach the other shore of the vast sea.

Shlok 109: While all the monkeys were halting there, the noise created out of their movement was 
dominantly heard, concealing the roar of the sea.

Shlok 110: That army of the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva, stationed as three divisios (viz. 1. bears 
2. long tailed monkes and 3. monkeys) looked fully dedicated to the cause of Rama.

Shlok 111: That army of monkeys reached the mighty ocean and was delighted to behold the mighty 
ocean being diffused by the velocity of wind.

Shlok 112: Seeing the sea, the abode of Varuna, which was boundless and having the opposite shore 
far off, inhabitd by a number of demons, the monkey-troups sat down there.

Shlok 113: Rendered appalling by the ferocity of fierce alligators and crocodiles, that ocen with 
its foaming waves at the end of the day and at the beginning of the night, appeared to laugh and dance.

Shlok 114: The ocean surged, when the moon rose. The image of moon was reflected limitlessly in 
it. The sea was full of huge alligators swift as fierce winds along with whales and great fish.

Shlok 115: That sea, the abode of Varuna was filled with serpents bestowed with flaming hoods, plunged 
with mighty aquatic creatures, abounding in various types of mountains, too difficult to cross, with 
an inaccessible path, suffocationly fathomless and an abode of demons.

Shlok 116: Increasing waves of the sea in which sharks and bodies of serpents swarmed, rose and 
fell whipped into motion by the breeze.

Shlok 117: Emitting whirled sparkles, shining with large water-snakes, a fearful abode of enemies 
of gods forever, the sea reaches upto the uneven Patala (subterranean region).

Shlok 118: The ocean looked like the sky. The sky looked like the ocean. The ocean and the sky looked 
alike without any distinction.

Shlok 119: The water blended with sky and the sky blended with water. Filled with stars above and 
the pearls below, both the sky and the sea looked with the same splendour.

Shlok 120: There was no distinction between the two, of the sea filled with a row of waves and of 
the sky with a row of falling clouds.

Shlok 121: The waves of the ocean together banging one another with a terrific resonance, sounded 
like a kettle-drum in the sky.

Shlok 122-123: Those high-souled monkeys saw the sea lashed with winds, resonating with abundance of 
precious stones and water, rising high as if enraged in a grip of hurricane, filled with a number of 
aquatic creatures and tossed by them in the air by seemingly murmuring waves.

Shlok 124: The standing monkeys were struck with amazement to see the ocean seemed moving, full 
of resonance produced by a multitude of dashing waves rolling to and fro.



SARGA 5
------------------------------

[Text] Rama recollects the lotus-eyed Seetha and laments much about his separation from her
Lakshmana consoles him and there approaches the sun-set.

Shlok 1: That famous army, well-protected by Neela, was kept stationed nicely at the northern
shore of the ocean.

Shlok 2: Both Maina and Dvivida the distinguished monkeys there moved in all directions
through that army, for the purpose of vigilance.

Shlok 3: After the army was settled at the sea-shore, Rama spoke to Lakshmana who was by his
side (as follows):

Shlok 4: "It is so said that sorrow gets vanished at the passing of time. But my agony of not
seeing my beloved is getting increased every day."

Shlok 5: "There is no anguish for me that my beloved is at a distance, nor that she was taken
away. Her age is indeed passing away. Only about this, I am repenting."

Shlok 6: "Oh, wind! Flow from the side of my beloved. Touch her and touch me too. It is
through you that I get a contact of her limbs. It is through moon that I get a contact of her
eyes."

Shlok 7: "That darling being carried away; might have cried "Oh, Lord!" Seeking for help.
That thought is like poison gulped by me, hovering in my stomach and scorching my limbs."

Shlok 8: "My body is scorching night and day, by the fire of passion, holding fuel of my
separation from her and my thoughts of her flaring into shimmering flames."

Shlok 9: "Oh, Lakshmana! Diving deep into the sea without you, I shall fall asleep. This
flaming passion will not thus scorch me, lying down in water.

Shlok 10: "It is enough for me, who is passionate, that Seetha with charming thighs and myself
are resting on one the same earth and on this fact I am able to survive."

Shlok 11: "Even as a paddy-field without water survives, by getting wet from a neighboring
paddy-field under water, I also survive since I am hearing her as surviving.

Shlok 12: "When shall I behold Seetha with charming hips, having long lotus-like eyes
flourishing as prosperity, by conquering the enemies?"

Shlok 13: "When, gently raising her face looking like louts, with its beautiful teeth and
lips, shall I drink as a sick man the sovereign drink of remedy?"

Shlok 14: "When will those breasts which are delightful close, bulging and quivering, looking
like palmary fruits, indeed press me?"

Shlok 15: "She, with dark-cornered eyes, who has fallen into the midst of demons, is surely
not getting any defender, she resembling an orphan, though I am her support."

Shlok 16: "How Seetha the daughter of King Janaka, my darling and Dasaratha's daughter-in-law
is sleeping among ogresses?"

Shlok 17: "Seetha will come out, driving away (through my force) the unassailable demons, as
driving away black clouds by a digit of the moon, in autumn."

Shlok 18: "Seetha, who by nature is slender, will undoubtedly become leaner further because of
her anguish, her abstinence from food and her adverse position of time and place."

Shlok 19: "When shall I bring back Seetha, having lodged arrows in Ravana's chest and having
abandoned this mental agony?"

Shlok 20: "When indeed Seetha the virtuous lady similar to the child of a celestial, with an
excited longing, will embrace my neck and release tears of joy?"

Shlok 21: "When shall I thrillingly abandon this terrible anguish, born out of my separation
from Seetha so soon, as we abandon a soiled clothing?"

Shlok 22: While that sagacious Rama was lamenting thus there, the sun, the weak-rayed due to
day-decline, approached the dusk.

Shlok 23: Lakshmana consoled Rama who was overwhelmed with anguish, duly recollecting the
lotus-eyed Seetha. Thereafter, Rama worshipped the evening-twilight.



SARGA 6
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana recalls the over-powering of Lanka and discovering of Seetha by Hanuman. He
calls a meeting of his ministers and invites suggestions from them in view of the latest situation
of a probable attack of Rama and his army on the City of Lanka.

Shlok 1: Having seen the fearful and the terrible act in Lanka done by Hanuma, like Devendra
the powerful King of celestials, Ravana with his face descended a little with shame, spoke to the
demons as follows:

Shlok 2: "By him, who was only a monkey, the irresistible City of Lanka was entered into and
was over-powered. Seetha the daughter of Janaka was also discovered by him.

Shlok 3: The thousand-pillared building used as a sanctuary was assaulted by Hanuma. Our most
excellent demons were killed. The entire City of Lanka was made turbid.

Shlok 4: May prosperity befall on you! What shall I do? What appropriate thing is to be done
next? Please speak that which is well-answering and that, if attempted becomes well-done.

Shlok 5: "Oh, people of great strength! Wise-men say that victory is dependent on good
forethought. Verily for that reason, I desire a deliberation about Rama."

Shlok 6: "There are three types of men in the world, namely the foremost the middle most and
the lowest. I am telling their inherent merits and defects."

Shlok 7-8: "The wise call him as the foremost among men, who carries through the beginning of
any undertaking after consulting those who are wedded with welfare of others, or with ministers who
are efficient in conferring decisions or with friends having common interests or additionally with
relatives or who try to get a favour from Providence too."

Shlok 9: "The wise men call that man as mediocre, who deliberates about an activity
solitarily, applies his mind on law and justice all by himself and performs works singly."

Shlok 10: "He who does not determine the merits and demerits of an act clearly, having
recourse to Providence and neglects his duty by simply telling ï¿½I shall do it', he is the lowest
among men."

Shlok 11: "In which manner these men are categorized always as good, bad or mediocre, so also
the resolution in thought is classified as good bad or mediocre."

Shlok 12: "The wise say that resolution of thought is excellent, in which the thinkers, on a
view perceived by scriptures, obtain consensus and are satisfied with it."

Shlok 13: "Only after deliberating several kinds of opinions, that decision of a matter
obtained finally by a consensus of the counselors, is called mediocre."

Shlok 14: "That resolution is said to be worst in which several arguments are made, employing
one or the other divergent opinions and in which there is no advantage even after a consensus."

Shlok 15: "For that reason, you, having excellent intellect, arrive at a well-thought out
rightful action. To me, this is earnestly to be done."

Shlok 16: "Rama surrounded by thousands of courageous monkeys, is coming to the City of Lanka,
for the purpose of besieging us."

Shlok 17: "Rama, by his be-fitting strength, can certainly cross the ocean easily, with his
brother along with his army and his companions."

Shlok 18-19: "He may even get the ocean dried up. He may do any other thing by his valour. The
aforesaid act of enmity with monkeys having commenced in this way, advise me everything that is
good for the city and my army."



SARGA 7
------------------------------

[Text] The demons inspire Ravana with confidence and eulogise his army's strength. They suggest 
that Indrajit alone is enough to kill the army of monkeys together with Rama.

Shlok 1-2a: Hearing the words of Ravana, those demons who were strong, stupid and without moral conduct, 
all raising up their joined palms and spoke to Ravana the king of demons, without knowing the strengths 
of their enemy's side (as follows):

Shlok 2b-3a: "Oh, king! Our army, equipped with iron bars, javelins, double-edged swords, darts and 
sharp-edged spears, is very great. Why are you getting worried?"

Shlok 3b-4: "After proceeding to Bhogavati city (the abode of Nagas in Patala one of the seven regions 
under the earth), the serpents there were defeated by you. Kubera (the bestower of riches) who resides 
on the peak of Mount Kailasa, surrounded by many yakshas (a class of demi-gods) surrendered to you after 
doing a great battle."

Shlok 5: "Oh, Lord! By your rage, Kubera who was boasting himself for his friendship with Lord 
Shiva (the Supreme Lord) and said to be a guardian of the world possessing great strength, was defeated 
by you in battle."

Shlok 6: "Throwing down a group of Yakshas, after causing a flutter among them and taking them 
in prison, this aerial car (Pushpak) was procured by you from Mount Kailasa."

Shlok 7: "Oh, the best of ogres! By Maya, the lord of demons, Mandodari his daughter was given 
to you in marriage, due to fear from you and duly desiring your friendship."

Shlok 8: Oh, mighty armed! Madhu Kumbhinasa's (your sister's) husband, another ruler of demons, 
who was proud of his valour and who was difficult to be defeated, was taken into your subjugation, your 
having won a battle against him."

Shlok 9: "Oh, mighty armed! After moving down to rasatala (the penultimate subterranean region), 
the you conquered serpent-demons Vasukim Takshaka, Saukha and Jati were conquered by you and captivated 
as your subjects."

Shlok 10-11: "Oh, annihilator of enemies, Commander of demons and the Lord! You after performing a 
battle for a year by you mighty demons who were beyond destruction, who were valiant and who obtained 
boons (for immortality) were defeated using your own strength in combat. Several fascinating tricks 
also were learnt from them."

Shlok 12: "Oh, illustrious king! Varuna's sons, valiant strong and who were followed by an army 
having four limbs (viz. elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry) were defeated by you in a battle."

Shlok 13-15: Oh, king! After entering a great ocean in the shape of Yama's realm, with a huge alligator 
in the form of death's rod of punishment, adorned with silk-cotton trees (bristling with thorns to be 
used a weapons), turbulent with a huge wave in the shape of noose of Kala (Time Spirit), with serpents 
in the form of Yama's servants and difficult to be conquered on account of mighty Jvara (Spirit presiding 
over fevers), and churning the sea in the form of Yama's forces, a great victory was obtained and death 
warded off by you. All the people there were delighted to see your good battle."

Shlok 16: "The earth was filled, like with big trees, with many warriors who were strong with a 
courage equal to that Devendra (Lord of celestials).

Shlok 17: "Oh, King! Rama was not equal to them in combat, by their valour excellence and energy. 
Those warriors, who were difficult to be overcome in battle, were overpowered and killed by you."

Shlok 18: Oh, emperor! Why exertion to you? You remain here. Oh, emperor! This Indrajit alone can 
destroy the monkeys."

Shlok 19: "Oh, emperor! After performing an excellent sacrifice to propitiate Mahesvara (the great 
lord shiva), a boon very rare to be obtained in the world, was acquired by him."

Shlok 20-22: "Approaching that huge ocean of army of celestials, whose fish are lanes and spheres, 
whose guts thrown asunder as duck-weeds, whose turtles are the elephants, whose frogs are the teeming 
horses, infested with alligators in the form of (eleven) Rudras (gods of destruction) and (twelve) Adityas 
(sons of Aditi), with huge serpents in the form of (forty nine) Maruts (wind gods) and (eight) Vasus, 
having chariots horses and elephants for its volume of waters and the sandy elephants for its volume 
of waters and the sandy banks its infantry, Devendra (Lord of celestials) was captured by him and was 
impelled to come to Lanka (as a detenu).

Shlok 23: "Oh, king! Having been released by the orders of your grand father Brahma, Devendra who 
killed demons called Shambara and Vrita and who was adored by all celestials, went back to heaven."

Shlok 24: "Oh, emperor! You send that Indrajit alone, so that the army of monkeys together with 
Rama will be brought to an end."

Shlok 25: "Oh, king! This unbefitting danger has come froma a man who is ordinary. It is not to 
be kept by you in mind, you will kill Rama."



SARGA 8
------------------------------

[Text] All the demons of King Ravana present there namely Prahasta, Durmukha,
Vajradamshtra, Nikumbha and Vajrahanu, eulogising their strengths, assure the king that they can
individually kill Rama and his army within no time.

Shlok 1: A valiant demon by name Prahasta, the commander-in-chief, appearing like a dark
cloud, joined his palms in salutation and spoke these words.

Shlok 2: "All gods, demons, gandharvas, devils, birds and serpents can be attacked by you in
battle. Why to talk about two human beings?"

Shlok 3: "All of us, in good faith but with negligence, were cheated by Hanuma. That monkey
cannot go alive, while I am alive."

Shlok 4: "I shall make the entire earth extending upto the ocean, along with mountains
forests and woods, bereft of monkeys. You command me."

Shlok 5: "Oh, Ravana! I shall arrange for your defence from that monkey. Not a little trouble
will come to you on account of your guilt (abduction of Seetha)."

Shlok 6: A demon by name Durmukha, being seriously enraged, spoke to him as follows: "This
humiliation meted out to us by that monkey is indeed not to be tolerated."

Shlok 7: "This insult to the city of Lanka and the palaces together with attack by Sugreeva
on the glorious Ravana are still outrageous."

Shlok 8: "Proceeding at this moment alone, I shall destroy those monkeys, whether they
entered the ocean or the subterranean region or the sky."

Shlok 9: Thereafter the very strong Vajradamshtra, beset with great anger, took hold of a
terrific iron club smeared with flesh and blood and spoke (as follows):

Shlok 10: "What work for us with that pitiable and miserable Hanuma, when Rama along with
Lakshmana and Sugreeva who are difficult to be conquered exist?"

Shlok 11: "Now itself, with this iron club, killing Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva after
perturbing the army of monkeys, I shall come back."

Shlok 12: "Oh, king! If you are willing, hear my words further. One who is skilled din a
stratagem alone will be without lassitude and can indeed defeat the enemies."

Shlok 13-14: O, king of demons! Thousands of demons able to change their form at will courageaous
appalling terrifying to look at and firm (in their purpose) can wear human body approach Rama
without embarrassment and all speak to Rama (as follows).

Shlok 15: "We have been despatched by Bharata, your younger brother. He is summoning his
forces and will surely come here soon."

Shlok 16: "Carrying spikes, javelins and maces together with arrows and swords in hand, we
will quickly go there from here soon."

Shlok 17: "Standing as groups in the sky and beating that army of monkeys with a mighty hail
of stones and missiles, we should send them to the world of Death."

Shlok 18: "If Rama and Lakshmana thus approach softly into our trap they will surely abandon
their lives as they are taken away by the trap."

Shlok 19: Thereafter Kumbhakarna's son, by name Nikumbha, strong and powerful, became very
angry and spoke (as follows) to Ravana, who made people cry.

Shlok 20-21b: All of you stay along with the king. I alone will kill there, Rama along with
Lakshman, Sugreeva along with Hanuma and all the monkeys also.

Shlok 21b-22a: Then, a demon by name Vajrahanu who was resembling a mountain, becoming enraged and
licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue, spoke as follows:

Shlok 22b-23: "You do your occupations freely redeemed of mental pain, play comfortably and drink
spirituous liquor without any worry. I alone will devour the entire army of monkeys."

Shlok 24: At this time I alone will kill Sugreeva along with Lakshmana Hanuma along with
Angada and all monkeys.



SARGA 9
------------------------------

[Text] Sumantra was unable to console Kausalya, who lied on the floor due to her extreme
grief over her separation from Rama, even though he tries to avert her grief by telling her that
Rama can reside in the forest delightfully, by warding off his agony.

Shlok 1-5: Then, Nikumbha, Rabhasa, the exceedingly strong Surya satru, Suptaghna, Yaj~akopa,
Mahaparsva and Mahodara, the unconquerable demons Agniketu and Rasmiketu, then the powerful son of
Ravana named Indrajit endowed with great energy, Prahasta and Virupaksha, Vajradamstra who was
extraordinarily strong, Dhumarksha and Atikaya and the demon by name Durmukha, carrying iron clubs,
sharp-edged spears, spikes, darts, javelins and axes, bows with excellent arrows and swords shining
like a vast expanse of water, and who were all extremely enraged, and flaming as it were with
glory, those demons rose up and spoke to Ravana (as follows).

Shlok 6: "Now itself, we shall kill Rama along with Lakshmana and Sugreeva as well as the
pitiable Hanuma by whom Lanka was attacked."

Shlok 7: Vibhishana (Ravana's youngest half-brother) restraining all those who were made to
seize weapons, were made to sit again by saluting them with joined palms and spoke as follows:

Shlok 8: "Dear brother! That act which cannot be accomplished by three well-known strategies
(viz . conciliation, gift and sowing dissention) , is only then to be accomplished by exhibiting
prowess, as stated by wise men."

Shlok 9: "The gallantries performed according to the prescribed precept, after being tested,
O dear brother, only succeed against those who are indifferent, who have been already attacked by
an enemy or who stand struck down by fate."

Shlok 10: "How do you wish to attack that famous Rama, who is always attentive, who has a will
to conquer, who is established in strength, who has subdued his anger and who is difficult to be
conquered."

Shlok 11: "Who can conceive or even imagine in this world, that Hanuma's speed in crossing the
formidable ocean, which is the lord of streams and rivers?"

Shlok 12: "O, demons! The strength and the abilities of the enemies are difficult to be
measured. They cannot be treated with contempt hastily by any means."

Shlok 13: "What offence was done earlier to the king of demons by the illustrious Rama, whose
wife that he bore away from Janasthana?"

Shlok 14: "Khara, who has gone beyond limits, was of course killed by Rama in an encounter.
Lives are certainly to be protected, according to one's own strength, by living beings."

Shlok 15: "For this reason, a very great danger because of Seetha will occur to us. She, who
was brought here, is to be given away. What is the use in doing anything, with an animosity as an
end?"

Shlok 16: "It is not appropriate to make enmity uselessly with Rama, who is valiant and who
follows righteousness. Let Seetha be given away to him."

Shlok 17: Before the City of Lanka with its elephants, horses and many riches are shattered by
arrows, let Seetha be given away to him."

Shlok 18: "Not so long as the huge army of monkeys which is very dangerous and unconquerable
attacks our Lanka, let Seetha be given away."

Shlok 19: "If the beloved wife of Rama is not given away of your own accord, the city of Lanka
will indeed perish. All our valiant demons too will Perish."

Shlok 20: "I am propitiating you because of my relationship. Act on my words. I am telling you
beneficial as well as truthful word. Let Seetha be given away to him."

Shlok 21: "Before Rama the prince discharges for your destruction, very strong and unfailing
arrows equal to the rays of autumnal sun and provided with new heads and shafts, let Seetha be
given away to Rama."

Shlok 22: "Abandon soon your anger, which destroys happiness and piety. Resort to
righteousness, which augments joy and fame. Become placid so that we may live with our sons and
relatives. Let Seetha be given away to Rama."

Shlok 23: After hearing Vibhishana's words, Ravana the king of demons left all of them and
entered his own palace.



SARGA 10
------------------------------

[Text] Vibhishana, the half-brother of Ravana, lists out bad omens occurring in the city
and in the gynaeceum and advises Ravana to restore Seetha to Rama as an atonement t these evil
forces. Ravana turns a deaf ear to Vibhishana's counsel and sends him away.

Shlok 1: Vibhishana, who always arrived at a settlement in matters of virtue, pleasure and
wealth and who was terrible in his act, on arrival of the dawn, entered the palace of Ravana.

Shlok 2: Ravana's palace was looking like a mass of rocks, elevated like a mountain-peak,
well-divided into spacious apartments and occupied by eminent men.

Shlok 3: It was inhabited by prime ministers, who were intelligent and beloved. It was
guarded on all sides by demons, who were trust worthy and efficient.

Shlok 4: The air was filled with the sighing breaths of elephants in rut, with tumultuous
noise produced by the blowing of conches and made to resound by an ensemble of musical
instruments.

Shlok 5: The palace was filled with a number of women-folk. It was having principal passages
in which spoken words were heard. It was having turrets made of pure gold and adorned with
excellent decors.

Shlok 6: The palace was like an abode of Gandharvas (celestial musicians) and of Maruts
(strom-gods) filled with a collection of jewels resembling a house of Nagas (serpent-gods).

Shlok 7: The valiant Vibhishana with great splendour entered that mansion of his elder
brother, Ravana, like the sun with rays outstretched with splendour entering a big cloud.

Shlok 8: Vibhishana with great radiance, heard the auspicious sounds of felicitous recital of
prayers uttered by the knowers of Vedas (scriptural texts), wishing for the victory of his
brother.

Shlok 9: Vibhishana of great strength, saw Brahmins who know Mantras (sacred texts) and
Brahmanas, respected and offered with pots filled of curd, clarified butter as well as with flowers
and unbroken rice.

Shlok 10: The mighty armed Vibhishana, being adored by the deomons and shining by his own
splendour, offered salutation to Ravana the younger brother of Kubera (the lord of riches), who
occupied the throne.

Shlok 11: Practicing customary formalities, Vibhishana who knew the code of conduct, obtained
a seat adorned with gold, as endowed to him by a glance of the king.

Shlok 12: In the presence of ministers and in privation, Vibhishana spoke to powerful Ravana
the words convinced of reason and which were very much beneficial.

Shlok 13: Vibhishana, who could discriminate between good and evil things in the world, having
sought the favour from his eldest (half-) brother by means of soothing words arranged in an order,
spoke in consonance with place, time and purpose.

Shlok 14: "O, annihilator of enemies! We are seeing inauspicious omens, since Seetha arrived
here."

Shlok 15: "Even if the sacrificial fire is fed with oblations while uttering a proper set of
Mantras (Spiritual texts), the fire is not flaring up well, emitting sparks, its flames are
enveloped in smoke and are coming forth, polluted with soot."

Shlok 16: "Serpents are seen at the corner of the sacrificial post which is nearest the fire,
also in houses keeping sacrificial fire and in places where sacred studies are made. Ants are seen
in things to be offered as oblations."

Shlok 17: "Cow's milk is getting curdled. Excellent elephants are bereft of rut. Horses are
neighing miserably and are not rejoiced in eating grass."

Shlok 18: "O, king! Donkeys, camels and mules shed tears, losing their hair and even if
treated asper medical procedures are not getting cured."

Shlok 19: "Crows in flocks are crying cruelly from all sides and are seen in crowds assembled
together on house-tops."

Shlok 20: "Vultures fly to and fro in circles over the city. Jackals are crying inauspiciously
at the approach of both dawn and the dusk."

Shlok 21: "At city-gates are heard loud cries of carnivorous animals gathered in groups, with
thundering noise."

Shlok 22: "O, brave man! Hence, when the actions of evil forces are happening in this way,
this atonement is appropriate that Seetha be given away to Rama and I like it."

Shlok 23: "O, emperor! If I am speaking this because of infatuation or greed, in that case
also, you ought not to find fault with me."

Shlok 24: "These bad omens are being seen indeed by demons and lady-demons of the city and of
the gynaeceum as well as all these people here."

Shlok 25: "All your ministers have abstained to pass this counsel to you. Whatever is seen or
heard, it is to be told certainly by me. Hence, you ought to do according to a justification of
things for the occasion."

Shlok 26: Vibhishana, the half- bother spoke these beneficial words to Ravana, the best among
demons in the midst of his half-brother's ministers.

Shlok 27: Ravana, who had evil inclination, heard those words, which were beneficial very
well-meant, soft, conformable to reason and suitable for the past future and present times, got
enraged and uttered this reply.

Shlok 28: "I do not see any fear from whom so ever. Rama cannot obtain Seetha by any means.
How Rama even along with Indra and the celestials can stand before me in battle?"

Shlok 29: Ravana, who annihilated the army of celestials and who was very powerful with an
impetuous valour, thus spoke and then sent away Vibhishana, who had spoken honestly.



SARGA 11
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana goes again to the assembly hall, to hold consultations with his ministers,
othere important demons and Vibhishana.

Shlok 1: That sinful Ravana, infatuated by his desire for Seetha, became emaciated by his
sinful action and by his despising of well-disposed people like Vibhishana.

Shlok 2: Though the occasion for war was lacking Ravana thought of consulting with his
ministers and well-wishers then to be a fit time.

Shlok 3: Approaching a great chariot, covered by a golden net, adorned with gems and corals
and yoked with trained horses, Ravana mounted on it.

Shlok 4: Ravana the excellent among demons ascended that most beautiful chariot, with a

Shlok 6: Demons wearing all types of unusual dresses and adoring various kinds of jewellery
then marched, duly surrounding him from sides and even behind.

Shlok 7: Great chariot-warriors in chariots, on excellent elephants in rut and horses
supportively coming in different gaits, rushed after Ravana quickly.

Shlok 8: Some had maces and iron bars in their hands. Some had javelins and iron clubs. Some
were holding axes. Some others had darts in their hands.

Shlok 9: As Ravana was proceeding to the assembly-hall, loud blare of thousands of trumpets
along with tumultuous noise of conches were produced.

Shlok 10: That excellently great chariot, making noise of the sound of its wheels, soon
entered the beautiful royal high-way.

Shlok 11: The spotlessly white umbrella, held on Ravana's head, shone like a full-moon.

Shlok 12: On his left and right sides, two fans of yak's tails with crystal handles and golden
fringes were shining.

Shlok 13: All those demons standing on ground offered their salutation by bending their heads
and joining their palms to his the best of demons, mounted on the chariot.

Shlok 14: Ravana the harasser of enemies, possessing great splendor, while being praised by
demons through cheers of victory, approached that organized assembly.

Shlok 15-16: Ravana with great splendour, with his body shining brightly, entered that assembly
hall, which was paved with gold and silver, whose interior was wrought with pure crystal, carpeted
with skins of deer, guarded by six hundred evil spirits, ever shining and well-constructed by
Visvakarma.

Shlok 17: Ravana, that hall, occupied a big and excellent throne embedded with jewels (cat's
eye gems), covered with skin of deer called Priyaka and furnished with pillows.

Shlok 18: Thereafter Ravana, as a king, ordered his messengers, who were moving fast as
follows: "There is a gigantic work before us. I know what the enemies are doing. Therefore, bring
all the demons here quickly."

Shlok 19- 20: Hearing those words, the messenger impelled the demons staying in entertainment
places, in bedrooms or in gardens and went without fear to every house in Lanka.

Shlok 21: Some of the demons mounted beautiful chariots; some mounted wild and strong horses
and some mounted on elephants. Some others went on foot.

Shlok 22: That city, extremely crowded with chariots elephants and horses rushing fast
together, appeared like birds rushing fast in the sky.

Shlok 23: Parking horses, elephants and various kinds vehicles like chariots, they entered by
foot the assembly-hall as a mountain-cave is entered by lions.

Shlok 24: Touching the feet of the king and greeted in turn by the king, some sat down on
seats, some others on mats (of Kusa grass) and others on the ground.

Shlok 25: Congregating in the assembly hall at the king's command, those demons took their
position round Ravana the king of demons, each according to their rank.

Shlok 26-27: Ministers who were scholars well versed in deciding action those endowed with good
qualities, those who were all-knowing, king's ministers who could perceive things by their power of
intellect and many warriors in hundreds, gathered according to their importance in that assembly
hall, wrapped with gold, for providing felicity in all actions.

Shlok 28: The high-souled and illustrious VibhiShana ascended an excellent auspicious and
spacious chariot yoked with good horses with its various parts decked in gold and drove towards the
assembly-hall of Ravana his elder brother.

Shlok 29: Then, that younger brother Vibhishana told Ravana his name and offered salutation to
the feet. Suka and Prahasta followed suit. Ravana gave them suitable seats separately.

Shlok 30: The aroma of the best aloe and sandal paste painted on the persons as also of
garlands worn round the necks of those demons duly adorned with ornaments of gold and gems and
attired in excellent clothes diffused all round in the assembly-hall.

Shlok 31: The assembled persons there did not yell loudly. None uttered untruth or even talked
vociferously. All of them were ready for action and were endowed with terrible energy. All of them
sat, perceiving their lord's face.

Shlok 32: In that assembly, that Ravana, full of mind, shone with brilliance among the
assemblage of those demons possessing great strength, like Devendra (the Lord of heaven) amidst
Vasus (a class of gods)



SARGA 12
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana instructs Prahasta, chief of his army to defend the city of Lanka carefully.
Prahasta positioned the army for defense accordingly at suitable places both inside and outside the
city. Ravana then narrates how he brought beautiful Seetha to Lanka from Dandaka forest, because of
his growing infatuation for her. Ravana asks his companions and relatives gathered there, to
suggest ways and means to kill Rama and Lakshmana. Then, Kumbhakarna, Ravana's brother first
accuses Ravana of his unworthy act but assures him that he would neutralize that dishonour by
killing the enemies.

Shlok 1: Then, Ravana an eminent person in the assembly, having seen all that gathering,
instructed Prahasta the chief of his army (as follows):

Shlok 2: "O, commander! You are allowed to issue an order to see that well-trained warriors
belonging to the four divisions of the army (viz.cavalry, infantry, chariots and elephants) are
entrusted with the defense of the city."

Shlok 3: Prahasta, resolute in his mind to follow the king's orders stationed the whole army
both outside as well as inside the city.

Shlok 4: Thereafter, Prahasta after keeping the whole army in defence of the city, sat in
front of the king and spoke (as follows):

Shlok 5: Your army, as strong as you are, has been positioned both outside and inside the
city. Pray do quickly, with an undistracted mind, whatever is preferable to you."

Shlok 6: Hearing the words of Prahasta, who wished the welfare of the kingdom, king Ravana,
with a desire to obtain happiness, spoke in the desire midst of his friends as follows:

Shlok 7: When you are in difficult situations regarding virtue pleasure and wealth, you are
able to have a correct notion of pleasant and unpleasant things, happiness and sorrow, gain and
detriment as well as advantages and disadvantages."

Shlok 8: "All of my works undertaken by you with an act of attention, were never in
vain."

Shlok 9: "I will obtain maximum prosperity, while abiding with you, as Indra obtains
properity while abiding with moon, planets, stars and celestials."

Shlok 10: "I am intent on reminding all of you again. But I could not inform this matter
earlier to Kumbhakarna because of his sleep."

Shlok 11: "This most powerful Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the wielders of weapons, was
indeed sleeping for the last six months and now, he woke up."

Shlok 12: "Seetha the beloved wife of Rama was brought from the forest of Dandaka, the place
frequented by demons."

Shlok 13: Seetha of languid pace, does not like to reach my bed. I do not imagine any other
woman similar to Seetha existing in the three worlds."

Shlok 14: "She has a slim waist, well-developed hips, and a face similar to an autumnal moon.
Looking like an idol of gold and being placid She appears like an illusory image created by
Maya.

[Commentary] Maya: Architect of demons, also versed in magic, astronomy and military
science.

Shlok 15: "Seeing Her feet with rose-coloured soles, smooth and evenly resting on ground with
the rosy soles, my lust is kindled."

Shlok 16: "Seeing her countenance similar to the flame of a sacrificial fire and looking like
the radiance of the sun, with her prominent nose and the pretty clear and handsome eyes, I became
unrestrained, having submitted to the will of my passion."

Shlok 17: "I have been polluted by lust and equally by anger and pleasure thus making me pale
and I have been ever since in grief and anguish."

Shlok 18-19: "Looking forward Rama, her husband, that longish large eyed Seetha, requested me to
give time for one year. I accepted the auspicious words of the charmingly eyed Seetha. I am wearied
of this lust, like a horse galloping along a path continuously."

Shlok 20: How the monkeys or even Rama and Lakshmana can cross the unassailable ocean,
completely infested as it was with sea-animals?"



"on the other hand, a huge destruction was done to us, by a single monkey. The
consequences of their acts are unpredictable. Tell me what is there in your mind, according to your
own understanding."

Shlok 22-23-24: "We have no fear with human beings. Even so, the matter can be discussed. Earlier,
together with you, I conquered the celestials in a battle between the celestials and demons. You
also conquered them. Knowing the whereabouts of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana together with Sugreeva
and other monkeys reached the other shore of the ocean."

Shlok 25: "Let a consultation be held by you and a judicious line of course suggested, so that
Seetha may not have to be handed -over to them back and Rama and Lakshmana may be killed."

Shlok 26: "I do not see any other's capability to cross the ocean even so with the monkeys.
Victory is surely mine."

Shlok 27: Hearing the lamentation of Ravana who was captivated by lust, Kumbhakarana became
angry and spoke the following words:

Shlok 28: "You should have contemplated thoroughly that very moment when Seetha was brought
here forcibly only after a single impulsive thought from the hermitage of Rama, who was accompanied
by Lakshmana, even like the river Yamuna fills the depression at its source the moment it descends
on earth."

Shlok 29: "O, emperor! If all this act of consultation with us was done at the beginning of
this action itself (of bringing Seetha here), it would have been worthy of you."

Shlok 30: "O, Ravana! A king who performs king's functions with a mind duly ascertained by
justice, will not repent thereafter."

Shlok 31: "Actions done pervertedly without use of any stratagem get spoiled, even as
oblations not intent on devotion got spoiled.

Shlok 32: "He who is not aware of prudence and imprudence, wants to do actions which are to be
done before at a later stage and actions which are to be done later at a stage before."

Shlok 33: "Seeing superior strength in a hasteful enemy, some look for his weak point, even as
swans seek the cleavage in the Kraunca mountain."

[Commentary] God Kartikeya (son of Lord Shiva) made a cleavage in Krauncha mountain with His
javelin. (Mahabharata, Salya Parva 46-84).

Shlok 34: "This great act was undertaken by you without proper thinking. By good fortune, Rama
did not kill you even as the meat mixed with poison would kill the consumer."

Shlok 35: "O, irreproachable brother! Therefore by killing your enemies, I shall neutralize
the dishonourable act undertaken by you in relation to your enemies."

Shlok 36: "O, ranger of night! I shall destroy your enemies. I shall do battle with the two
brothers, even if they are Indra and the sun-god or the god of fire and the wind-god or Kubera (the
god of riches) and Varuna (the god of water).

Shlok 37: "Entering the combat with a mountain-sized body and fiery teeth, roaring the while
and attacking with an immense bludgeon, I shall strike terror in Indra himself!"

Shlok 38: "Even before Rama strikes me once more with a second arrow, I shall drink his blood.
Cheer up freely.

Shlok 39: "I shall try to fetch victory, which brings pleasure to you, by the killing of Rama.
By exterminating Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the leaders of monkey-troops."

Shlok 40: "Enjoy yourself freely. Drink excellent of wines to the extent of your desire
without any anxiety. Rama, having been dispatched by me to the abode of death, Seetha will be at
your disposal forever."

[Text] Advised by Mahaparsva to take charge of Sita by force, Ravana expresses his
inability to do so, because of a curse pronounced against him by Brahma (lord of creation) in the
past. Ravana then boasts of his own prowess.

Shlok 1: Perceiving Ravana enraged, a very strong demon named Mahaparsva thought for a while
and with joined palms, spoke as follows:

Shlok 2: "That man indeed is a fool, who after reaching a forest inhabited by wild beasts and
vicious elephants and having duly found honey, does not drink it."

Shlok 3: "O,annihilator of enemies! Who is a lord to you, who are a lord of all? Setting your
foot upon the heads of your enemies, take pleasure with Sita."

Shlok 4: "O, ruler endowed with a mighty prowess! Act in the mode of a cock, forcibly against
her. Enjoy that Sita, by charging on her again and again and revel with her."

Shlok 5: "What fear will be there to you, after fulfilling your lust? All that comes or yet
to come will be prevented (by us)."

Shlok 6: "Kumbhakarna and Indrajit of great might together with us are capable of keeping off
even Devendra (god of celestials), wielding the weapon of a thunderbolt."

Shlok 7: "Overstepping the methods of giving away gifts or conciliation or even showing
dissention being followed by right men, I like accomplishment of actions through hostile
means."

Shlok 8: "O, ruler endowed with great might! We shall make all your enemies reaching here to
surrender, by the power of our weapons. There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 9: Appreciating the words spoken thus by Mahaparsva, King Ravana spoke the following
words:

Shlok 10: "O, Mahaparsva! Know a little secret about me. I shall tell you an incident, which
occurred to me long ago."

Shlok 11: "Once I saw a celestial nymph, Punjikasthala(by name) flashing like a flame,
concealing herself in the sky and proceeding towards the abode of Brahma."

Shlok 12: "She was made unclothed by me and was enjoyed forcibly. Thereafter, appearing like a
crumpled lotus, she went to the abode of Brahma."

Shlok 13: "I think that the matter was made known to the high soled Brahama and then the
enraged Brahma spoke to me the following words:

Shlok 14: "From today onwards, if you revel with any other woman forcibly, your head then
undoubtedly will break asunder into a hundred pieces."

Shlok 15: "Fearing the curse given in this manner by Brahama, I am not violently making Sita
the daughter of Videha, to mount on my beautiful bed forcibly."

Shlok 16: "My swiftness is like that of an ocean. My movement is like that of a wind. Rama
does not know this and hence he is indeed having an encounter with me."

Shlok 17: "If not otherwise, who wants to arouse me (for a combat) as one would awaken a lion
asleep, sitting at a place in a mountain cave or arouse into activity an enraged Death?"

Shlok 18: "Rama did not see the arrows, looking like two tongued serpents, coming forth from
me. That is why he is marching against me for a battle"

Shlok 19: "I shall blaze up Rama swiftly with my arrows in hundreds resembling thunder bolts
discharged from my bow, like tormenting an elephant with fire brands."

Shlok 20: "Surrounded by great army, I shall take away that strength of Rama, as a rising sun
at dawn takes away radiance of the stars."

Shlok 21: "Even Devendra (lord of celestials) with thousand eyes or Varuna (king of the
Universe) can not conquer me in battle. Once upon a time, this city of Lanka ruled by Kubera (Lord
of riches) was conquered by me with the power of my arms."



SARGA 14
------------------------------

[Text] Vibhishana informs the assembly about the strength of the monkeys, and about the
power of Rama`s arrow. He also informs that none on the demon's side can withstand Rama, in battle.
Prahasta replies that they have no fear at any time to face Rama in battle. Then, Vibhishana
reiterates the enormous strength of the fatal arrows discharged by Rama and requests the assembly
to save Ravana by giving back Sita to Rama.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of Ravana the king of demons and the growls of Kumbhakarna,
Vibhishana spoke the following friendly and meaningful words to Ravana the foremost king of
ogres:

Shlok 2: "By whom, O, king, has been wrapped around your neck, this great serpent of gigantic
body called Sita, with heap of expended hoods as her bosom, having poison as her anxiety and with
sharp fangs as her sweet smile and with five hoods as her five fingers."

Shlok 3: "Even before the monkeys with their body size as mountain peaks, having their teeth
and nails as weapons, rush full upon the city of Lanka, give back Sita to Rama."

Shlok 4: "Even before arrows resembling thunder bolts and with a speed equal to wind,
dispatched by Rama, take away the heads of chiefs of demons, give back Sita to Rama."

Shlok 5: "O, king! Either Kumbhakarna or Indrajit and either Mahaparsva or Mahodara and
either Nikumbha or Kumbha or even Atikaya cannot withstand Rama in battle."

Shlok 6: "Even if you are protected by the sun god, or by Maruts (storm gods) nor even seated
in the lap of Indra or god of Death nor if you have penetrated into the regions of heaven or under
the earth you will not be spared by the arrows of Rama."

Shlok 7: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Prahasta spoke as follows: "We are not knowing of
fear at all. We do not have fear of either celestials or demons at any time."

Shlok 8: "We do not have fear from Yakshas (demi- gods) or Gandharvas (celestial musicians)
or eminent Nagas (serpent demons) or from birds and reptiles on the field of battle. When such is
the case, how can we have fear from Rama, the son of a human king at any time in battle?"

Shlok 9: Vibhishana who desired the welfare of the king and who possessed a stable mind in
virtue wealth and pleasure, after hearing the inimical words of Prahasta, spoke highly meaningful
words as follows:

Shlok 10: "O, Prahasta! The series of actions king or Mahodara as also yourself and
Kumbhakarna propose to take against Rama are impossible of being accomplished, any more than going
to heaven by wicked minded persons."

Shlok 11: "How is it possible by me or by you or by all the demons to kill Rama, who is expert
in all matters, any more than a person without a bark to cross a great ocean."

Shlok 12: "Even the celestials would feel bewildered when placed in front of the king Rama who
gives priority to righteousness, is a great car warrior, was born in the dynasty of Ikshvaku and is
capable of accomplishing his objects."

Shlok 13: "O, Prahasta! The sharp arrows discharged by Rama, which are furnished with heron's
feathers and are dangerous to be approached, have not yet penetrated, duly piercing, your body.
That is why, you indulge in a boastful talk."

Shlok 14: "The sharp and fatal arrows, discharged by Rama with the speed of a thunderbolt,
have not yet penetrated, duly splitting your body. That is why; you are indulged in a boastful
talk."

Shlok 15: "Ravana or Triseersha, with great strength or Nikumbha the son of Kumbhakarna or
Indrajit or yourself are not capable to withstand Rama, who is equal in strength to Indra, in
battle."

Shlok 16: "Even Devantaka or Narantaka or Atikaya or Atiratha of gigantic proportions, or
Akampana who is mighty as an ocean are not capable to withstand against Rama in battle."

Shlok 17: "This king who is overcome by evil addictions, * is rude in nature and acts
inconsiderately. Such a king is being surrounded as a caucus by you who are his companions taking
the form of his enemies for the ultimate destruction of demons."

[Commentary] *The following are the seven evil habits to which kings are generally found
addicted: --Harshness of speech and severity of punishment, extravagance, drinking, love of women,
hunting and gambling.

Shlok 18: "You lift up and release this king, who has been wrapped forcibly by a terrific and
exceedingly strong snake of boundless proportions having thousand hoods and make him completely
free."

Shlok 19: "All the well-wishers who are getting their desires fulfilled by the king, should
come together and protect the king by coercion even by pulling his hair if necessary as one who is
taken ossession of by evil spirits with terrific strength, is protected by one's kith and kin."

Shlok 20: "This Ravana, for his part who is going to be enveloped forcibly by an ocean in the
shape of Rama - which is full of excellent water (who possesses excellent moral character) and who
is about to fall into the mouth of Patala (the nethermost subterranean region) in the shape of
Rama, is fit to be rescued united by you."

Shlok 21: "I am telling these right and wholesome words, as per my opinion, to this city and
the demons inhabiting in it as well as to the king and his well wishers: Let Sita be given back to
Rama."

Shlok 22: "A counselor is he, who after knowing the strength of the enemies and that of his
own (master) and even so duly grasping with his intellect, the status quo, fall, or rise in
military power like-wise on both sides, renders advice which is appropriate to the interest of his
king."



SARGA 15
------------------------------

[Text] Indrajit criticizes Vibhishana for underestimating the former`s strength. Vibhishana
abuses Indrajit for his immaturity of mind and for his rash nature in underscoring the power of
Rama`s arrows. Vibhishana further advises Ravana to give back Sita along with valuable presents to
Rama and to live happily ever after in Lanka.

Shlok 1: Carefully hearing the words of Vibhishana, whose intellect was equal to that of
Brihaspati (god Of wisdom and eloquence) the high spirited Indrajit, the chief of army of demons
spoke as follows:

Shlok 2: "O, youngest uncle! Pray, what? Your words are meaningless and very much
frightening. Even he who is not born in this race would neither speak such words nor do such a
thing (as you suggest)."

Shlok 3: "In our race, this Vibhishana the youngest uncle is the only individual lacking in
strength, heroism, prowess, courage, valor and vital powers" W.w m.

Shlok 4: "What after all are those princes who are mere human beings? They can be killed even
by one very ordinary demon among us. O, coward! Why are you frightening us? "

Shlok 5: "At one time, the competent Devendra, the lord of three worlds, was indeed tossed
down on the floor by me. All the flocks of celestials were cast into fear and all of them fled to
different quarters."

Shlok 6: "Airavata (Indra`s elephant), which was making noise discordantly, was hurled down
by me on the floor. I forcibly extracted its teeth and frightened the entire flock of
celestials."

Shlok 7: "How can I, with great valor, who suppressed the arrogance of even the celestials
and who made the lives of even excellent of the demons miserable, not capable of conquering the two
princes who are ordinary human beings?"

Shlok 8: Hearing those words of Indrajit, who was equal to Indra (god of celestials),
dangerous to be approached, and possessing great vital power, Vibhishana the excellent one among
bearers of weapons spoke then the following highly meaningful words:

Shlok 9: "O, child! There is no stability of thought in you. Being a boy, you are still
immature in mind. That is why, many a meaningless word was prattled by you too, for only your
self-destruction."

Shlok 10: "In the guise of a son, O, Indrajit, you are an enemy of Ravana putting on the mask
of a well wisher in that even hearing (from me) of his destruction at the hands of Rama, you are
blindly agreeing with him."

Shlok 11: "You surely are fit to be killed. Nay, he too is fit to be killed, who brought you,
a reckless boy here today and ushered you foolishly in the proximity of counselors".



"O, Indrajit! You are a stupid, irresolute, without humility, rude natured; unwise;
evil person, inexperienced and highly evil minded. You are speaking in this manner because you are
an immature boy".

Shlok 13: "Who can endure the arrows, discharged by Rama in battle right in front of the
enemy, which resemble Brahma's (creator's) staff in glory, which present a form similar to that of
God of Death and are equal to the Yama's staff?"

Shlok 14: " O, king! Offering riches, precious stones, good jewellery, excellent clothes,
bright colored gems and the god-like Sita to Rama, let us live here, free from anguish."



SARGA 16
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana refuses to hear the words of Vibhishana and rebukes him with harsh words.
Vibhishana gets angry and sets off, to leave Ravana.

Shlok 1: Ravana, goaded by death, spoke the following harsh words to Vibhishana, who was very
stable and who had spoken wholesome words:

Shlok 2: "One can stay together with an enemy or even with a furious snake, but one cannot
stay together with an adversary yet avowing himself as a friend"

Shlok 3: "O, demon! I know the conduct of kinsmen in all the worlds. These kinsmen always are
rejoiced at the calamities of their kinsmen"

Shlok 4: "O, demon! The kinsmen indeed insult and even humiliate their kinsman, who is an
effective leader, a person of education and right conduct and a valiant man."

Shlok 5: "The horrible kinsmen with their concealed thoughts and treacherous minds, terrific
ones as they are, always rejoice each other in adversities."

Shlok 6: "Previously in a forest called Padmavana, some maxims were spoken by elephants,
which saw men with nooses in hand. Hear and I shall tell them."

Shlok 7: "For us, fire or weapons or nooses are not begetting fear. The terrific kinsmen,
incited by selfishness are begetting fear to us."

Shlok 8: "These kinsmen will inform the strategy to our enemies to seize us. There is no
doubt about this. Out of all fears, the fear of kinsmen is very much troublesome for us. It is a
well known thing."

Shlok 9: "There is wealth in cows. There is fear for kinsmen. There is fickleness in women.
There is austerity in Brahmins."

Shlok 10: "O, gentleman! Hence, it is not of liking to you that the people are venerating me,
that I obtained riches and that I am sitting tight in the heads of enemies".

Shlok 11: "As drops of water fallen on lotus leaves do not get clung to those leaves, so also
a friendship does not cling to vulgar ones."

Shlok 12: "As rainy clouds in autumn, even though thundering, cannot get the earth saturated
with water, so also friendship does not have tenderness of heart in vulgar people."

Shlok 13: "As a honey bee, even though getting nectar from a flower, does not stick on to that
flower due to its eager desire for more, you also belong to that category as friendship does not
stick on to vulgar people."

Shlok 14: "As even though trying to drink nectar from a flower of grass, a honey bee cannot
get it, so also friendship cannot be extracted from vulgar persons."

Shlok 15: "How an elephant abuses its body by helping itself with dust after taking bath
earlier with its trunk, friendship gets an abuse in vulgar persons in the same manner."

Shlok 16: "O, demon, walking about by night! If any other person utters these words in this
manner, he will be ceasing to exit at this moment. O, destroyer of race! A curse upon you!"

Shlok 17: Hearing those harsh words from Ravana, Vibhishana who advocates justice, wielding a
mace in his hand, soared high into the sky, along with four other demons.

Shlok 18: Then, the illustrious Vibhishana who became angry also spoke these words to king
Ravana, his brother after moving into the sky.

Shlok 19: "O, king! You are a brother to me. You utter whatever you like. Elder brother is
like a father. Even if he is not staying in a right path, he is to be respected. But I cannot
forbear these harsh words from you."

Shlok 20: "Those who have an ill composed mind and who get conceded to the occasion do not
assimilate the words of prudence, spoken by a well wisher."

Shlok 21: "O, king! Men who forever speak pleasing words are easy to be obtained. But one who
speaks of useful but unpleasing words as also the one who listens to them, are rare to be
obtained"

Shlok 22: "I could not ignore you, being destroyed by the noose of Yama (god of death); tied
around you and which snatches away all beings, as none can ignore a burning house."

Shlok 23: "I do not wish to see you, being killed by Rama with his sharp arrows, adorned with
gold and each resembling like a blazing fire."

Shlok 24: "Persons who are valiant, strong and skilled in weaponry, when time comes, sink down
(ruin) as a dam constructed with sand sinks down."

Shlok 25- 26: "As an elder brother, bear the words spoken by me, who desire your welfare. Guard
this city and yourself along with demons, by all means. Let all be well with you. I am departing.
Be a happy person without me."

Shlok 27: "O, Ravana the ranger of the night! My words are not relishing to you, who are being
restrained by me duly desiring your welfare. Persons whose duration of life is to end, do not
accept the salutary words spoken by their well wishers"



SARGA 17
------------------------------

[Text] Vibhishana together with four of his companions reach Rama's place. Halting in the
sky itself, Vibhishana asks Rama to give a refuge to him. Sugriva tells Rama that he cannot trust
Vibhishana the demon. Then Rama asks for opinion of the leaders in his group. Angada, sharabha,
Jambavan and Mainda expressed their apprehensions to accept Vibhishana. But Hanuman says that
Vibhishana need not be doubted because he thinks that Vibhishana understands the merits in Rama and
demerits in Ravana. Hanuman further adds that Vibhishana is approaching Rama for refuge because
Vibhishana is desirous of obtaining the kingdom of demons. Hanuman requests Rama to take his final
decision on the matter.

Shlok 1: Having spoken the aforesaid harsh words to Ravana, Vibhishana arrived almost
immediately to the place where Rama was together with Lakshmana.

Shlok 2: Those leaders of monkeys standing on the ground saw Vibhishana, resembling the peak
of Mount Meru and shining like a thunderbolt in the sky.

Shlok 3: His four companions of terrific prowess were also there with him. They were wearing
weapons and armour and were adorned with excellent ornaments.

Shlok 4: Vibhishana also resembled a mass of cloud, the equal of the God who wields the
thunderbolt. He was holding excellent weapons and was adorned with wonderful jewels.

Shlok 5: Sugriva the valiant of monkeys, who was difficult to be overpowered, having seen
Vibhishana, the fifth one along with four others, became thoughtful along with monkeys.

Shlok 6: Having thought for a moment, Sugriva spoke these sterling words to all those monkeys
and to Hanuman in particular.

Shlok 7: "See this demon possessing all types of weapons, coming along with four demons.
There is no doubt that he is coming to kill us."

Shlok 8: Hearing Sugriva's words, all those excellent monkeys lifted trees and mountains and
spoke as follows:

Shlok 9: "Do you swiftly order us to slay these wicked doers, O, king? Let us strike these
fools down so that they drop to the ground!"

Shlok 10: While the monkeys were speaking thus among one another, Vibhishana had reached the
northern shore and indeed coolly halted there.

Shlok 11: That great and highly intelligent Vibhishana, halting in the sky itself, saw Sugriva
and those monkeys and spoke to them in a loud voice (as follows):

Shlok 12: "There is a demon called Ravana, the king of demons, having a bad conduct. I am his
younger brother, known as Vibhishana."

Shlok 13: "It is Ravana who, having killed a bird Jatayu, took away Sita from Janasthana.That
unfortunate lady is held captive against her will and she is now amidst the female titans who guard
her jealously"

Shlok 14: "I persuaded Ravana again and again by my diverse words and arguments to restore
Sita smoothly to Rama.

Shlok 15: "That Ravana, impelled by fate, did not receive my sage advice, as a perverted
person does not accept his prescribed medicine"

Shlok 16: "Reviled by him and humiliated as a slave, I, leaving my sons and my wife, have come
to take refuge with Rama."

Shlok 17: "Inform immediately to high soled Rama, the protector of all the worlds, that I,
Vibhishana, have come here."

Shlok 18: The swift-paced Sugriva, having heard the words of Vibhishana, spoke more hurriedly
to Rama, in front of Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 19: "Belonging to the enemy force, here is an adversary taking us unawares, who
unexpectedly has come here to slay us at the first opportunity like an owl destroying crows!"

Shlok 20: "O, annihilator of enemies! You ought to be aware of the design, distribution,
leading of the army and the secret service of the monkeys and also of your foes. May good come to
you!"

Shlok 21: "These demons can assume any form at will and can disappear. They are valiant and
deceitful. We can not trust them at any time."

Shlok 22: "He may be a spy of Ravana the king of demons. He will succeed to become a member
among us and create differences. There is no doubt."

Shlok 23: "Otherwise he , intelligent by himself, can get into possession of a weak point in
us. Having first gained our confidence by craft, he may even at any time attack us."

Shlok 24: "A contingent supplied by friends or an inhabitant of the woods (like our selves),
or furnished by hereditary warriors or paid servants - all these contingents can be accepted but
not that furnished by an enemy."

Shlok 25: "O, Lord! He is indeed a demon by nature and a brother of an enemy who came directly
from an adversary. How can we keep trust in him?"

Shlok 26: The younger brother of the famous Ravana, called Vibhishana along with four other
demons approached you for refuge."

Shlok 27: "O, the excellent one among men knowing what is right! Know that Ravana is sending
Vibhishana. I opine that Vibhishana is fit for arrest."

Shlok 28: "O, the faultless one! Being sent with a crooked intent, this demon came here to
attack when you are going to repose faith in him, (remaining hidden by his witchcraft).

Shlok 29: "This Vibhishana is indeed the brother of cruel Ravana. Hence, let him along with
his ministers be killed, by imposing severe punishment on them."

Shlok 30: The chief of army Sugriva, who knew how to speak expressed thus hurriedly to Rama,
who was skilled in oratory and thereafter entered into silence.

Shlok 31: Hearing those words of Sugriva, the exceedingly strong Rama addressed as follows to
the monkeys in front of Hanuman staying near by:

Shlok 32: "The very reasonable words uttered by Sugriva about Vibhishana were heard by you
too."

Shlok 33: "An efficient and intelligent person ever desirous of everlasting well being of his
friends should properly advise them well in difficult matters. Hence, tell your opinion one by
one"

Shlok 34: Thus asked by Rama, those monkeys free from lassitude, wishing to do good and out of
their politeness, spoke their respective opinions to Rama as follows:

Shlok 35: "O, Rama! Nothing is unknown to you in the three worlds. You are consulting us with
a friendly heart, as an honor to us."

Shlok 36: "You are avowed to truth, a valiant man and a righteous man of firm fortitude. You
take action only after proper investigation. You have good memory. You are committed in your heart
to your friends."

Shlok 37: "Hence, your counselors, who are rich in their minds and are moreover efficient, one
by one, will tell their opinion with reason."

Shlok 38: Having spoken thus by the monkeys, Angada the intelligent monkey told Rama to
arrange for examination of Vibhishana before hand."

Shlok 39: "Vibhishana who came from an enemy is indeed to be doubted by all means. He is not
to be made as a trust worthy person so soon."

Shlok 40: "Deceitful persons move around, concealing their peculiar nature and attack at weak
places. They will create a very great misfortune."

Shlok 41: "One must take a decision, after ascertaining the pros and cons of it. One should
take up the action, if there is an advantage and reject it, if it is faulty."

Shlok 42: "O, king! If there are great faults in him, let him be rejected undoubtedly. If we
recognize many good qualities in him, let him be accepted."

Shlok 43: Thereafter Sharabha on his part spoke the following meaningful and decisive words:
"O, tiger among men! Let a spy be sent to shadow him"

Shlok 44: "By sending out a spy and causing a suitable investigation by a keenly intellectual
spy, he can then be accepted as per justice."

Shlok 45: Then, the discerning Jambavan on his part, perceiving the matter through his
learning derived from scriptures, advised the following fault-less and qualitative words:

Shlok 46: "This Vibhishana came from sinful Ravana who has contracted hostility with you and
that too at a wrong place and time. He is to be suspected by all means."

Shlok 47: Then Mainda, skilled in discriminating good and bad conduct in others observed the
matter carefully and spoke in his perfect oratory in the following highly reasonable words:

Shlok 48: "O, king of kings! This Vibhishana is indeed the younger brother of that Ravana. Let
him be questioned slowly by sweet words"

Shlok 49: "O, the best among men! Having read actually his mind whether he is dangerous or
not, you should act according to your feelings."

Shlok 50: Then the well educated Hanuman, the excellent among counselors; spoke the following
smooth meaningful, sweet and brief words:

Shlok 51: "Even Brihaspati, while talking cannot excel you, who are possessing an exalted
intellect. You are powerful and the foremost man among those who are eloquent."

Shlok 52: "O, king! O, Rama! I am talking neither for argument, nor for competition (with
other counselors, nor for superiority, nor out of passion for debate but on account of importance
of this matter in hand."

Shlok 53: "I am perceiving an error in what was advised by your counselors assigned to look
into advantages and disadvantages, accruing from accepting Vibhishana. It is not possible for such
a judicious investigation into his character."

Shlok 54: "Without entrusting any work, it is not possible to understand his ability. But at
the same time, it occurs to me as a mistake to entrust any work so soon to a stranger."

Shlok 55: "What ever was told by your counselors that it was befitting to send spies to
Vibhishana, that action is not possible due to impracticality of the proposition."

Shlok 56: "It has been said that Vibhishana came into a wrong place and time. In that matter,
I have to express my thought. Listen to it."

Shlok 57: "This place and time become rightly obtained in his mind , as he has thought that
you are superior to Ravana and also found merits in you and demerits in Ravana."

Shlok 58: "It is indeed appropriate for him to arrive at this place and time, by seeing the
prowess in you and the wickedness in Ravana. It is worthy of his judgment."

Shlok 59: "O, king! Whatever was told by your counselors that let Vibhishana be questioned by
spies of unknown identity, my considered view is as follows:

Shlok 60: "A wise man being questioned suddenly would be apprehensive of that questioning. In
those circumstances, an easily obtained friend becomes faithless upon facing a deceitful
questioning."

Shlok 61: "O, king! Without possessing a high skill of reading his diversified tones, it is
not possible rapidly to comprehend his intention."

Shlok 62: "I am not seeing any bad intention at all in his talk. His face is also bright.
Hence, I do not doubt him."

Shlok 63: "A deceitful person does not approach so fearlessly and confidently. His expression
too is not bad. Hence, there is no doubt to me on him."

Shlok 64: "It is not possible to hide expression of the face, even if it is concealed. By
force, the internal intent of the persons certainly gets revealed."

Shlok 65: "O, the eminently skillful man in work! An action endowed with proper place and time
transacts successfully, if it is performed quickly."

Shlok 66-67: "Seeing your perseverance and the improper conduct of Ravana as well as hearing
about Vali having been killed and Sugriva anointed as king, he deliberately came here, with a
desire to obtain the kingdom of demons. On consideration of this aspect alone, he is worthy of
acceptance by us."

Shlok 68: "O, Rama the best among the wise! It has been told by me this according to my
ability about the sincerity of this demon. After hearing my words, you are indeed the final judge
of the issue."



SARGA 18
------------------------------

[Text] Hearing Hanuman's words, Rama says that he cannot desert Vibhishana who is seeking a
refuge in him. Initially Sugreeva disagrees with Rama's opinion. But when Rama explains the
different circumstances under which Vibhishana is acceptable, Sugreeva also agrees with that view.
Finally Vibhishana joins as an associate in Rama's side.

Shlok 1: Thereafter the inviolable Rama who possesses sacred knowledge, after hearing
Hanuman's words, spoke with a clear understanding, the following opinion that was firm in his
mind:

Shlok 2: "I also wish to tell my opinion about Vibhishana. I want it to be heard by you, who
are firmly established in our welfare."

Shlok 3: "By any means, I do not desert anyone who arrives with a friendly appearance, even
if he has a defect. His acceptance is irreproachable in the eyes of good men"

Shlok 4: Then, Sugreeva the chief of monkeys closely analyzed and examined the aforesaid
words of Rama and thereafter spoke the following most auspicious words:

Shlok 5: "What matters if this ranger of night is very dangerous or other wise, if he can
desert his own brother at a time of peril? Whom will he not betray subsequently?"

Shlok 6- 7: Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Rama who was truly mighty looked round all of them ,
smiled a little and spoke the following words to Lakshmana, of virtuous characteristics:

Shlok 8: "Without studying scriptures and without serving elders, it is not possible to speak
such words as Sugreeva spoke."

Shlok 9: "It appears to my mind that there is however something peculiar in these
circumstances which are clearly to be seen in all lives of kings and even occurring in ordinary
life."

Shlok 10: "It is told that persons of the same family and rulers belonging to adjoining
territories become enemies and strike in times of adversities. For this reason, he came here."

Shlok 11: "Even if belonging to the same family, persons who are virtuous do respect their own
well wishers in that family. Generally among kings, even a virtuous person is apprehended."

Shlok 12: "With regard to the draw back you told me in the matter of accepting a person coming
from the side of an adversary, hear from me what the scriptures say."

Shlok 13: "We do not belong to the same family. Further, Vibhishana the demon is desirous of
acquiring the kingdom. A few of the demons also may be rather learned ones. That is why, Vibhishana
is acceptable."

Shlok 14: "Kinsfolk do not live together in a fearless mode and in a delightful manner. Hence,
they get a split among themselves. For this reason, a fear has come to him. This loud appeal is
also major cause. That is why, Vibhishana can be accepted."

Shlok 15: "My dear one! Neither all brothers are like Bharata, nor all sons of a father like
me nor all friends are like you."

Shlok 16: Hearing Rama's words Sugreeva who was together with the highly wise Lakshmana stood
up saluting and spoke these words:

Shlok 17: "O, Rama the excellent among the tolerant! Realise that Ravana has sent Vibhishana,
the demon. I think of him to be worthy of being taken as a captive."

Shlok 18- 19: "O, the mighty armed Rama! The faultless one! This demon is being sent to kill you
who are unsuspecting, or to kill Lakshmana or me in trust. He came here with a crooked mind. He
with his counselors is fit to be imprisoned. Is not Vibhishana the brother of cruel Ravana?"

Shlok 20: Speaking thus to Rama, the best of Raghu dynasty, Sugreeva who knew the mode of
expression, thereafter kept silent.

Shlok 21: Hearing those words of Sugreeva, Rama pondered over the words and thereafter spoke
more auspicious words to Sugreeva as follows:

Shlok 22: "What does it matter whether that demon is very bad or not bad? He is incapable of
doing even a little harm to me."

Shlok 23: "O, Sugreeva, Lord of monkey-troops! If I wish, I can kill those devilish beings,
demons, supernatural beings and ogres living on earth with just a tip of my finger"

Shlok 24: "It is narrated how by a dove, its enemy ( a fowler) when it came for a refuge, was
received according to rules of hospitality and was invited for a feast with its own flesh."

Shlok 25: "O, the excellent of monkeys! The aforesaid dove indeed accepted as a guest, the
fowler as he came, although he killed its wife .How much more a man like me has to do?"

Shlok 26: "Hear the verses inculcating virtue so long ago, by Kandu, the son of a sage called
Kanva, a great sage and a speaker of truth."

Shlok 27: "O, king the terminator of enemies! Even an enemy, who formed a cup with his
hollowed hands, a miserable person, a person who is begging and who is seeking a refuge should not
be killed with the aim of not being cruel."

Shlok 28: "An enemy who comes for protection against others, even if the aforesaid enemy is
oppressed or arrogant, is to be protected by one who has a disciplined mind, even by abandoning
one's life."

Shlok 29: "If he does not protect rightly through his strength, by fear or by ignorance or by
desire, it is a sin to be reproached by the world."

Shlok 30: "If having not been protected, a refugee dies before the eyes of a man who is able
to protect him, the former takes along all his moral merit and goes."

Shlok 31: "In not protecting thus the persons who take refuge, there is a great blemish
involved in it. It does not bestow heaven. It destroys reputation. It devastates strength and
valor"

Shlok 32: "I will follow the excellent words of Kandu. It becomes a very righteous thing,
gives reputation, leads to heaven and the rewards appear consequently."

Shlok 33: "He who seeks refuge in me just once, telling me that ï¿½I am yours', I shall give him
assurance of safety against all types of beings. This is my solemn pledge"

Shlok 34: "O, Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys! Let him either be Vibhishana or even Ravana
himself; I have given an assurance of safety to him. Bring him here."

Shlok 35: Hearing Rama' s words, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, overwhelmed as he was with
cordial friendship, replied to Rama as follows:

Shlok 36: "O, Rama, who knows righteousness, the crest jewel among lords of the world! What
surprise is there in thinking that you, duly endowed with true essence of life and established in a
right path, speak these venerable words?"

Shlok 37: "My inmost spirit also feels Vibhishana to be a genuine person, he being well
examined from all angles, by act of inference and by his appearance."

Shlok 38: "O, Rama! Hence, let the highly wise Vibhishana be equal among us soon together. Let
him get our friendship too"

Shlok 39: Hearing those words of Sugreeva, Rama the king of men, as acknowledged by Sugreeva,
held meeting with Vibhishana, as Indra the lord of celestials once met Garuda the king of
birds.



Thus, this is the 18th chapter in Yuddha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India.

SARGA 19
------------------------------

[Text] Descending from the sky, Vibhishana seeks refuge at the feet of Rama. On Rama's
enquiry, he explains about the strength of Ravana. Rama promises to kill Ravana and anoints
Vibhishana. Rama sits on the sea -shore, seeking the help of the ocean god to yield a passage for
his army to pass through and reach the city of Lanka.

Shlok 1: While the assurance of protection having been given to Rama, the highly sagacious
Vibhishana the brother of Ravana bent down and glanced towards the earth.

Shlok 2: The virtuous Vibhishana descended joyously from the sky to the ground along with his
faithful companions and alighted in the vicinity of Rama.

Shlok 3: Thereafter, Vibhishana along with the four demons fell prostrate and spoke to Rama
the following words which were equitable suitable and delightful.

Shlok 4: "I am the younger brother of Ravana and was humiliated by him. I sought refuge in
you, who are the refuge for all the beings."

Shlok 5: "Abandoning Lanka, friends and possessions, I place my kingdom, life and happiness
at your disposal."

Shlok 6- 7: Hearing those words of Vibhishana, Rama in a soothing tone and with a refreshing
look in his eyes, spoke these words: "Tell me really the strengths and weaknesses of the
demons."

Shlok 8: Thus asked then by Rama who was unwearied in action, Vibhishana started telling
about the detailed strength of Ravana.

Shlok 9: "O, prince! Because of a special boon given by Brahma (lord of creation), Ravana can
not be killed by all beings, Gandharvas (celestial musicians), serpents, and birds."

Shlok 10: Kumbhakarna, my elder brother born after Ravana, who is valiant and highly powerful,
has enough strength to fight against Indra (Lord of celestials) in battle.

Shlok 11: "O, Rama! You might have heard about Prahasta, his chief of army. He defeated
Manibhadra in a battle on the mountain of Kailasa."

Shlok 12: "When furnished with gloves made of the skin of Iguana (to prevent injury from the
bowstring) and when clad in armor that no arrow can pierce, that Indrajit (son of Ravana) standing
in battle wielding a bow, becomes invisible."

Shlok 13: "O, Rama! The glorious Indrajit, having propitiated the God of Fire, strikes his
enemy while remaining invisible in the battle field with a huge battle array (on both sides)"

Shlok 14: "Mahodara and Mahaparsva along with a demon called Akampana who are equal to the
guardians of the world in battle - they are the commanders of his army."

Shlok 15: "In the city of Lanka, are residing ten thousand crore demons, who can assume any
form at will and who consume flesh and blood as their staple food"

Shlok 16: "King Ravana along with those demons made war against the guardians of the earth.
Those guardians of the earth along with the celestials were defeated by the wicked Ravana."

Shlok 17: Hearing the aforesaid words of Vibhishana, Rama scrutinized them all attentively and
spoke the following words:

Shlok 18: "O, Vibhishana! I indeed know those feats standing to the credit of Ravana, which
were told by you, as true."

Shlok 19: "After killing Ravana along with Prahasta and his son (Indrajit), I will make you
the king. Hear this truth from me."

Shlok 20: "Ravana may well plunge into Rasaatala (the penultimate subterranean region) or even
Paataala (the nethermost subterranean region) or seek the presence of Brahma and he will not be
left alive by me."

Shlok 21: "I will not enter Ayodhya without killing Ravana together with his sons, companions
and relatives in battle. I take oath on my three brothers."

Shlok 22: Hearing the words of that Rama, who was unwearied in action, the right minded
Vibhishana saluted him by bowing his head and started telling as follows:

Shlok 23: "I will extend my help in killing the demons and in attacking the city of Lanka.
According to my strength, I will also penetrate into the army of the adversary to fight."

Shlok 24: Rama on his part, duly delighted, embraced Vibhishana who was speaking as aforesaid
and spoke to Lakshmana as follows: "Bring some water from the ocean."

Shlok 25: "O, Lakshmana who bestows honor on others! Quickly consecrate as a king of demons
this greatly intelligent Vibhishana with that water, so that I am pleased."

Shlok 26: Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana consecrated Vibhishana as a king, as per the royal
instructions, amidst the leaders of monkeys.

Shlok 27: Perceiving that instant graciousness in Rama, the monkeys cried, proclaiming
"excellent, excellent" about the high soled Rama.

Shlok 28: Hanuman and Sugreeva asked Vibhishana as follows: " How can we cross the
imperturbable ocean, the habitation of Varuna, the god of water by all of us along with our army of
monkeys possessing a great splendor?"

Shlok 29: "In what manner shall we along with the army swiftly cross the sea, the lord of
streams and rivers, and arrive at that strategy?"

Shlok 30: Hearing their words, the right minded Vibhishana replied as follows: "It is apt if
prince Rama seeks ocean as his refuge"

Shlok 31: "This immeasurable great ocean was excavated by Sagara*. Hence, this great ocean
will be inclined to do the act for Rama, his kinsman".

[Commentary] *Sagara was one of Rama's ancestors. His story is told in Balakanda.

Shlok 32: Hearing the aforesaid words of the learned demon Vibhishana, Sugreeva came to the
place where Rama and Lakshmana were there.

Shlok 33: The long necked Sugreeva then started to tell the auspicious words of Vibhishana,
advising Rama to approach the ocean (to allow him a passage).

Shlok 34-35: That advice found favor with Rama who by nature is of pious attitude. Then that
highly illustrious Rama replied to Sugreeva, the ruler of monkeys who was skillful in action and
who was accompanied by Lakshmana. Full of respect for Vibhishana's words, he told him as also his
brother Lakshmana smilingly as follows:

Shlok 36: "O, Lakshmana! This idea of Vibhishana is agreeable to me. Sugreeva is a learned
person. You are ever wise in your thoughts. Both of you decide on the matter and inform whichever
is agreeable to you."

Shlok 37: Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva and Lakshmana both, valiant as they were, spoke with
proper courtesy, the following words: .

Shlok 38: "O, Rama the tiger among men! Why not Vibhishana's words, which are soothing at this
time of crisis be agreeable also to us?"

Shlok 39: "Without constructing a bridge across this fiery ocean, which is an abode of Lord
Varuna, even the celestials and demons along with Indra cannot reach the city of Lanka."

Shlok 40-41: "Let the valiant Vibhishana's words be followed suitably. It is enough that we have
already wasted our time. Let the ocean be commanded to yield a passage for the army to reach the
city being ruled by Ravana."

Shlok 42: Having been thus exhorted, Rama then sat on the shore of the ocean covered with
blades of Kusha grass, as the God of Fire ascends the altar.



SARGA 20
------------------------------

[Text] As per the advice of Sardula, Ravana sends Shuka to Sugriva as an ambassador. The
monkeys harass him, who came to their place as a spy. But because of Rama's gracefulness, Shuka
comes out of danger. Sugriva gives a fitting reply to Ravana's message sent through Shuka. When
monkeys again try to bind him and harass him, Rama prevents them from killing him.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, an energetic demon named Shardula came and saw the army, commanded by
Sugriva, which was drawn up in a battle array.

Shlok 2: That demon, the spy of Ravana the evil natured king of ogres, coolly observed that
army from all sides, speedily returned to Lanka and spoke to their king as follows:

Shlok 3: "Boundless and immeasurable like another ocean, this multitude of monkeys and bears
is approaching Lanka.".

Shlok 4- 5: "These brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the sons of Dasaratha, the excellent and the
most dignified men endowed with beauty have arrived in the cause of Sita and settled in a camp
after reaching the sea shore" .

Shlok 6: "O, monarch! Their army is employed around a radius of ten yojanas (eighty miles)on
all sides. You have to ascertain this truth quickly"

Shlok 7: "O, monarch! Your other spies also ought to ascertain the fact quickly. Under such
circumstances, either conciliation or an act of giving away or sowing dissention (in the enemy's
ranks) may be employed."

Shlok 8: Hearing Shardula's words Ravana the lord of demons was perturbed and immediately
determined his cause of action. Then he spoke the following words to a demon by name, Shuka the
foremost among those who know their duty.

Shlok 9: "Going quickly, speak fearlessly to king Sugriva on my behalf, according to my
command, in an excellent and gentle voice, as follows:"

Shlok 10: O, great king! You are indeed born in a noble family, possessor of a great strength
and are a son of Riksharaja. No gain whatsoever or any harm will accrue to you (from this battle)
.O, lord of monkeys! Nevertheless, you are like a brother to me."

Shlok 11: "What does it matter to you, if I have embezzled the wife of a wise prince?
(Therefore) return to Kishkindha"

Shlok 12: "This Lanka cannot be reached by monkeys in any way. It cannot be acquired even by
celestials and Gandharvas (celestial musicians), why to talk about men and monkeys?"

Shlok 13: Then Shuka the demon heralded by Ravana turned himself into the form of a bird and
quickly flew into the sky.

Shlok 14: Proceeding in the sky for a distance continuously over the ocean, Shuka then stood
up in the sky itself and spoke these words to Sugriva:

Shlok 15: Shuka repeated all the words the wicked Ravana had told him to say to Sugriva. As he
was still speaking, the monkeys bounded into the air to reach him at that moment quickly to tear
off his wings and to smite him by their fists.

Shlok 16: The demon thus attacked was forcibly seized by all the monkeys and immediately
brought down to the ground from the sky.

Shlok 17: Shuka being harassed by monkeys spoke the following words: "O, Rama! Messengers are
not to be killed. Let your monkeys be restrained properly."

Shlok 18: "That messenger, who by abandoning the opinion of his king will speak about his own
opinion though he being a messenger and he who on the other hand speaks that which was not told to
him, that messenger is indeed fit to be killed."

Shlok 19: Hearing Shuka's complaining words, Rama spoke to the foremost of monkeys, who were
beating him as aforesaid, saying "Do not kill him"

Shlok 20: Perceiving no fear from monkeys, Shuka became light winged, virtually standing in
the sky and spoke again the following words.

Shlok 21: "O, Sugriva, rich in courage and possessing great strength and valor! What am I to
tell Ravana, whose nature is to cause world to cry?"

Shlok 22: Hearing the aforesaid words, the mightily strong Sugriva the king of monkeys and the
foremost among them, with a merciless mind then spoke to the blame less Shuka, Ravana's spy, as
follows:

Shlok 23: "O, Ravana, worthy of killing! You are not my companion. You are not worthy of
sympathy. You are not the person who helped me in any way. I do not like you, as you are Rama's
enemy. Hence, You are worthy to be killed like Vali, along with your associates"

Shlok 24: "O, the king of demons! I am killing you along with your sons, relatives and other
kinsfolk. Arriving with a great army, I will reduce the entire Lanka and all of you to ashes."

Shlok 25- 26: "O, stupid Ravana! You along with your younger brother will not be left unkilled by
Rama, even if you are protected by all including Indra (the lord of celestials) or even if you have
disappeared (by virtue of conjuring trick) or obtained, the solar orbit or entered the nethermost
subterranean region or even if approached the lotus feet of Shiva (the lord of Kailasa
mountain)"

Shlok 27: "I do not see any protector to you as such in the three worlds, nor do I see any
devilish being or a demon or a Gandharva (celestial musician) or an ogre coming forward to protect
you."

Shlok 28: "You killed Jatayu, the king of vultures and who was senior to you in old age. Why
the wide-eyed Sita was not taken away in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana? Having made her
captive, you do not recognize her for what she is."

Shlok 29: "You are unaware how strong, high soled and irresistible even to celestials, is this
Rama the excellent man of Raghu dynasty, who shall deprive you of your life."

Shlok 30: Thereafter, Angada the son of Vali and the foremost of the monkeys spoke as follows:
"O, Sugriva the highly intelligent! He is not an ambassador. He appears to me as a spy."

Shlok 31: "All our army has been indeed evaluated by him, standing here. Let him be made
captive. Let him not return to Lanka. This indeed finds favor with me."

Shlok 32: Commanded then by the king Sugriva, the monkeys jumped up, seized and bound him, who
without defence, wailed loudly.

Shlok 33: Harassed by those monkeys there, Shuka on his part cried loudly towards Rama, the
high soled son of Dasaratha as follows:

Shlok 34-35: "My wings are being pulled out forcibly. My eyes are being pierced. If I die, all
the sins incurred by me between my birth and my death would fall to your share."

Shlok 36: Hearing that lamentation of Shuka, Rama did not allow his killing by the monkeys.
Rama ordered monkeys to release him, as he came as an ambassador.



SARGA 21
------------------------------

[Text] The careless ocean did not appear in his personal form to Rama, even when it was
requested to do so. Rama becomes angry at the ocean and looses fierce arrows, which cause a terror
among the creatures inhabiting the sea.

Shlok 1: Thereafter Rama, the annihilator of enemies, spreading sacred grass on the sea
shore, making a respectful salutation (by joining his palms) to the great ocean with his face
turned eastward, lied down with his arm, resembling the body of a snake , as his pillow.

Shlok 2- 3: His arm formerly adorned with armlets of gems and gold and the most excellent jewels
of pearls, was touched more than once, by excellent women ( Kausalya and other mothers or by royal
maids).

Shlok 4: Formerly, his arm used to be tended with sandalwood and aloe and with saffron pastes
and made beautiful like the splendor of a rising sun.

Shlok 5: In the past, the aforesaid arm was graced by the head of Seetha on the couch. It
resembled the body of Takshaka. (A snake) supported on the water of the Ganga.

Shlok 6- 7: The aforesaid arm resembled a yoke. It enhanced the grief of his enemies in battle.
It was delightful to his friends. It is now placed at the shore of the sea.

Shlok 7- 8- 9: The aforesaid arm whose skin had been hardened by the strokes of the bow string, off
the left arm resembling a great mace and that mighty right arm that bestowed thousands of cows in
charity was used as a pillow. Rama, the competent man and the mighty armed said: " Either crossing
of the ocean or a death should occur to me today". Making that resolve he laid down by the ocean,
restraining his speech and with a pious disposition according to tradition.

Shlok 10: Following the scriptural injunction, that Rama who was devoted to his sacred vow,
while sleeping on the ground spread with Kusha grass, spent a time of three nights there.

Shlok 11: Remaining there for three nights, Rama who was skilled in policy and fond of piety,
waited upon the ocean, the lord of rivers.

Shlok 12: Though honored according to his worth by the self subdued Rama, the careless ocean
did not appear in his personal form to Rama.

Shlok 13: Rama becoming angry with the ocean, having the outer corners of his eyes turned red,
spoke those words to Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, who was in his vicinity:

Shlok 14: "O, what arrogance of the ocean, who does not appear himself personally before me!
Indeed calmness, forbearance kind spoken ness and straight -forwardness- these qualities of noble
men give weak results, when directed towards those having no virtues."

Shlok 15: "This world honors that man, who boasts himself, is corrupt and shameless, runs
about in all directions advertising himself and commits every kind of excess"

Shlok 16: "O, Lakshmana! In this world, it is not possible to obtain fame, glory or victory at
the end of a battle, by conciliation"

Shlok 17: "O, Lakshmana! Behold now this ocean, having its water made suffocated soon with its
crocodiles floated on all sides and broken asunder by my arrows".

Shlok 18: "See here, O, Lakshmana, the coils of water snakes, the huge bodies of alligators
and the trunks of sea elephants being shattered by me."

Shlok 19: "I will make the ocean with its multitude of conches, oyster shells, fishes and
crocodiles, dry up now in this great battle"

Shlok 20: "This ocean is considering me as an incapable man endowed as I am with forbearance.
It is a great mistake to show forbearance to such an individual."

Shlok 21- 22: "The Ocean is not appearing himself before me on kind words. O, Lakshmana! Bring the
bow and the serpentine arrows. I shall dry up this ocean, so that our monkeys can cross it by
feet."

Shlok 23- 24: "Being provoked now, I will shake this ocean, even if it is unshakable. I will force
the ocean, which is demarcated by banks and agitated with thousands of waves, bereft of a boundary,
by my arrows. I will agitate the great ocean, thronged with great demons."

Shlok 25: Speaking as aforesaid, Rama with his eyes made larger by anger and wielding a bow
with his hand, became dreadful to look at, as a blazing fire at the end of the world.

Shlok 26: Swaying his terrific bow and making the earth tremble by his violence Rama released
the arrow resembling a powerful thunderbolt of Indra. (god of celestials).

Shlok 27: Those excellent arrows having a great speed and ablaze by their splendor, penetrated
the waters of the ocean, striking the water- snakes with terror.

Shlok 28: The great jerk of water with fishes and alligators of the ocean, together with the
resonance of the wind became very much dreadful.

Shlok 29: Immediately that great ocean, became shaken by the cluster of huge waves enveloped
by a multitude of conches in its rolling waves and a smoke came out.

Shlok 30: Sea-snakes having brilliant faces and glittering eyes and the very valiant demons
residing in nethermost subterranean region of the sea, were perturbed.

Shlok 31: Thousands of waves, so large resembling Vindhya and Mandhara mountains, jumped up
from the sea with its crocodiles and sea monsters.

Shlok 32: That ocean with its multitude of fluctuating waves, with its frightened serpents and
demons, with huge crocodiles coming out, became full of noise.

Shlok 33: Then Lakshmana rushed towards Rama who in a terrific velocity was stretching his
incomparable bow, with a penetrating sigh, crying: "No further, no farther" and took hold of the
bow.

Shlok 34: "O, honorable man! Even without the destruction of the ocean, the purpose of you the
greatest hero will be fulfilled. Men like you do not fall into the sway of anger. You see some
durable and noble alternative"

Shlok 35: Brahmana-sages and celestial sages, stationed in the interior of the sky cried in a
loud voices, saying "No farther, no farther" and making a noise "Ah,Oh,Alas!"



SARGA 22
------------------------------

[Text] When Rama is about to release a missile presided over by Brahma from his bow, the
sea-god appears in person before him with joined palms and advises him to get a bridge constructed
by Nala across the ocean. The ocean god disappears after giving this advice to Rama. Nala
accordingly constructs a bridge across the sea with the help of other monkeys.

Shlok 1: Then, Rama spoke these harsh words to the ocean: "O, ocean! I will make you dry up
now along with your nethermost subterranean region."

Shlok 2: "O, Ocean! A vast stretch of sand will appear, when your water gets consumed by my
arrows; when you get dried up and the creatures inhabiting you get destroyed by me."

Shlok 3: "By a gush of arrows released by my bow, our monkeys can proceed to the other shore
even by foot; O, ocean!"

Shlok 4: "O, Sea the abode of demons! You are not able to recognize my valor or prowess
through your intelligence .You will indeed get repentance at my hands."

Shlok 5: "Fixing an arrow resembling the Rod of Brahma (the creator) charged with a missile
(presided over by Brahama) to his excellent bow, the exceedingly powerful Rama stretched it towards
the sea."

Shlok 6: While Rama was stretching that bow, both the heaven and earth suddenly seemed to be
split asunder. Mountains also were shaken.

Shlok 7: Darkness enveloped the world. All the quarters were obscured. Lakes and rivers were
soon agitated.

Shlok 8- 9: The moon sun and the stars moved obliquely and though the sun's rays lighted the
sky, it was enveloped by darkness and shined with a blaze of hundreds of meteors while thunders
reverberated with an unparalleled sound in the sky.

Shlok 10: Series of celestial winds blew in their colossal form and the winds, then sweeping
away the clouds, tore up the trees again and again.

Shlok 11: The wind, shattering the mountain peaks, broke off the points of the rocks. Winds of
great velocity struck together in the sky and emitted flashes of radiance proceeding from lightning
with a great sound and then there were great thunders.

Shlok 12- 13: The visible creatures cried out along with the thunders. The invisible beings too
gave off a terrific noise. The creatures were overpowered, frightened, agitated, lied down and also
very much anguished. They did not move due to fear.

Shlok 14- 15: The great ocean with its waves and water, along with its living creatures including
snakes and demons soon became possessed of a terrific velocity. Due to that speed and swelling of
waters, the ocean crossed beyond the other shore to the extent of a Yojana (eight miles).

Shlok 16: Rama born in Raghu dynasty and the annihilator of enemies, did not retreat before
that ocean, which swelled and crossed its limits.

Shlok 17: Then, Sagara (the ocean god) himself rose from the middle of the ocean as the sun
rises at dawn from the huge mountain of Meru.

Shlok 18: That ocean along with snakes of flaming jaws appeared with a hue of glossy emerald
adorned with gold.

Shlok 19- 20- 21-22- 23- 24: The valiant ocean, the lord of rivers, wearing a wreath of pearls, with his eyes
resembling lotus leaves, bearing a beautiful garland made of all kinds of flowers on his head, with
ornaments of refined gold, adorned with excellent jewels made of pearls from his domain, decorated
with different kinds of gems and metals, resembling Himavat mountain, wearing on his broad chest a
locket shedding a white luster, resembling a Kaustubha gem (adorning the blossom of Lord Vishnu)
and hanging in the middle of a single string of pearls, with a multitude of waves whirled around
him, encircled by the clouds and winds, escorted by rivers mainly the Ganga and Sindhu, endowed
with diverse forms resembling various deities, approached Rama with joined palms, who stood with
arrows in hand, addressing him first as ï¿½Rama!' and spoke the following words:

Shlok 25: "O, beloved Rama! Earth, wind ether, water and light remain fixed in their own
nature, resorting to their eternal path."

Shlok 26: "Therefore, I am fathomless and my nature is that it is impossible of being swum
across. It becomes unnatural if I am shallow. I am telling you the following device to cross
me."

Shlok 27: "O, prince! Neither from desire nor ambition nor fear nor from affection, I am able
to solidify my waters inhabited by alligators."

Shlok 28: "O, Rama! I shall make it possible to see that you are able to cross over. I will
arrange a place for the monkeys to cross me and bear with it. As far as the army crosses me, the
crocodiles will not be aggressive to them."

Shlok 29: Then, Rama spoke to that ocean as follows: "Listen to me. This great arrow should
not go in vain. In which region should it be descended?"

Shlok 30: Hearing Rama's words and seeing that powerful arrow, the large splendid Ocean spoke
the following words to Rama:

Shlok 31: "Towards my northern side, there is a holy place. It is well known as Drumatulya, in
the same way as you are well known to this world."

Shlok 32: "Numerous robbers of fearful aspect and deeds, having the sinful Abhiras as their
chief, drink my waters there."

Shlok 33: "I am not able to bear that touch of those wicked people, the evil doers, O, Rama!
Let this excellent arrow with out vain be released over them there."

Shlok 34: Hearing those words of the high-soled Ocean, Rama released that excellent and
splendid arrow towards that place as directed by the ocean.

Shlok 35: The place where the arrow, whose splendor was akin to that of a thunder and a
thunder bolt, was descended by Rama- that place is indeed famous as desert of Maru* on this
earth.

[Commentary] * Maruï¿½Malwar in Rajastan (India)

Shlok 36: The earth there, pierced by the dart, then emitted a sound . The waters of the
penultimate subterranean region gushed forth from the mouth of that cleft.

Shlok 37: Then the hollow became known as Vrana. Water constantly seen, gushing forth from it
resembled seawater.

Shlok 38: A terrific splitting sound was born in that place. Water was dried up in those
cavities, as a result of hurling of that arrow by Rama.

Shlok 39- 40: That desert of Maru became famous in the three worlds. Rama (the son of Dasaratha),
a wise man and a valiant man resembling a celestial, made that cavity dried up and gave a boon to
that desert of Maru.

Shlok 41- 42: Due to granting of a boon by Rama, that desert of Maru became the most congenial
place for cattle rearing, a place with a little of disease, producing tasty fruits and roots, with
a lot of clarified butter, a lot of milk and various kinds of sweet- smelling herbs. Thus it became
an auspicious and suitable move, bestowing these merits.

Shlok 43: While that cavity was burning, Ocean the lord of rivers spoke these words to Rama
who knew all scientific treatises.

Shlok 44: "O, excellent man! This one, named Nala, a glorious person, is the son of
Vishvakarma; who was given a boon by his father and is equal to Visvakarma."

Shlok 45: "Let this greatly energetic monkey build a bridge across me. I can hold that bridge.
He is just the same as his father."

Shlok 46: Thus speaking, the god of Ocean disappeared from that place. Then Nala, the more
distinguished among monkeys stood up and spoke the following words to Rama of great power:

Shlok 47: "The great Ocean disclosed a truth. I will construct a bridge across this large
Ocean, taking recourse to the skill and ability of my father."

Shlok 48: "This Sagara, the formidable mass of water, in fear of punishment, gave a passage to
Rama, wishing to see a bridge constructed on it."

Shlok 49: "On the mountain of Mandara, the following boon was given by Visvakarma to my
mother: "O, god like lady! A son equal to me will be born to you."

Shlok 50: "I am a son born of Visvakarma's own loins. I am equal to Visvakarma. This god of
Ocean has reminded me. The great ocean spoke the truth. Being unasked, I have not told you my
details earlier."

Shlok 51: "I am capable of constructing a bridge across the ocean. Hence, let the foremost of
monkeys build the bridge now itself."

Shlok 52: Then, being sent by Rama, hundreds and thousands of monkey heroes jumped in joy on
all sides towards the great forest.

Shlok 53: Those army-chiefs of monkeys, who resembled mountains, broke the rocks and trees
there and dragged them away towards the sea.

Shlok 54- 55: Those monkeys filled the ocean with all types of trees like Sala and Asvakarna,
Dhava and bamboo, Kutaja, Arjuna, palmyra,Tilaka, Tinisa, Bilva, Saptaparna, Karnika, in blossom as
also mango and Asoka.

Shlok 56: The excellent monkeys, the forest animals lifted and brought, like Indra's flag
posts, some trees with roots intact and some others without roots.

Shlok 57: From here and there the monkeys brought Palmyra trees, pomegranate shrubs, coconut
and Vibhitaka, Karira, Bakula and neem trees.

Shlok 58: The huge bodied monkeys with mighty strength uprooted elephant-sized rocks and
mountains and transported them by mechanical contrivances.

Shlok 59: The water, raised up due to sudden throwing of mountains in the sea, soured upward
towards the sky and from there again, gushed back.

Shlok 60: The rocks befalling on all sides perturbed the ocean. Some others drew up strings a
hundred Yojanas long (in order to keep the rocks in a straight line.)

Shlok 61: Nala on his part initiated a monumental bridge in the middle of the ocean. The
bridge was built at that time with the cooperation of other monkeys, of terrible doings.

Shlok 62- 63: Some monkeys were holding poles for measuring the bridge and some others collected
the material. Reeds and logs resembling clouds and mountains, brought by hundreds of monkeys, lead
by the command of Rama, fastened some parts of the bridge.

Shlok 64: Monkeys constructed the bridge with trees having blossom at the end of their boughs.
Some monkeys looking like demons seized rocks resembling mountains and peaks of mountains and
appeared running hither and thither.

Shlok 65: Then, a tumultuous sound occurred when the rocks were thrown into the sea and when
mountains were caused to fall there.

Shlok 66: On the first day, fourteen Yojanas of bridge were constructed by the monkeys
speedily, thrilled with delight as they were, resembling elephants.

Shlok 67: In the same manner, on the second day twenty Yojanas of bridge were constructed
speedily by the monkeys of terrific bodies and of mighty strength.

Shlok 68: Thus, on the third day twenty-one Yojanas of the bridge were constructed in the
ocean speedily by the monkeys with their colossal bodies.

Shlok 69: On the forth day, a further of twenty-two Yojanas were constructed by the dashing
monkeys with a great speed.

Shlok 70: In that manner, on the fifth day, the monkeys working quickly constructed
twenty-three yojanas of the bridge up to the other seashore.

Shlok 71: That Nala, the strong and illustrious son of Visvakarma and an excellent monkey
built the bridge across the sea as truly as his father would have built it.

Shlok 72: That beautiful and lovely bridge constructed by Nala across the ocean the abode of
alligators, shone brightly like a milky way of stars in the sky.

Shlok 73: With a desire to behold that marvel, celestials along with Gandharvas, the heavenly
musicians, Siddhas (semi-divine beings of great purity and perfection, possessing super natural
qualities) and great sages came then and stood up in the sky.

Shlok 74: The celestials and Gandharvas, the heavenly musicians saw Nala's bridge, having a
width of ten yojanas and a length of hundred yojanas and which was very difficult to be built.

Shlok 75- 76: The monkeys taking long leaps and short leaps shouted in joy. All other beings saw
that construction of the bridge across the ocean as unimaginable, impossible and wonderful, causing
their hair to stand on end in amazement.

Shlok 77: Those thousand crores of monkeys in a great spectacle reached the other shore of the
great ocean soon after building that bridge across the sea.

Shlok 78: That colossal bridge, which was broad, well-constructed, glorious, well postured and
held together firmly, looked beautiful like a separating straight line in the ocean.

Shlok 79: Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his hand, stood up on the seashore along with his
ministers, for the purpose of invading the enemies.

Shlok 80- 81: Thereafter, Sugriva on his part spoke to Rama, the truly brave man as follows: "O,
valiant man! This ocean, the abode of alligators, is indeed vast. You ascend the shoulder of
Hanuman and let Lakshmana ascend the shoulder of Angada. These monkeys can hold both of you while
flying in the sky."

Shlok 82: Rama the glorious and righteous man, wielding a bow along with Lakshmana together
with Sugriva, went in front of that army.

Shlok 83: Some monkeys went along the middle of the bridge. Some others went along the sides.
Some others were jumping into water. Some others marched forward on the path. Some monkeys entered
the sky and aviated like Garuda the eagle.

Shlok 84: The highly terrific sound of the ocean was covered up by the great sounds of the
terrific monkeys who were crossing the sea.

Shlok 85: That army of monkeys, which crossed the ocean by the bridge constructed by Nala, was
encamped by Sugriva at a shore having many fruits tubers and water.

Shlok 86: Seeing that Rama's accomplishment, which was amazing and arduous; celestials,
Siddhas (semi-divine beings possessing supernatural faculties) and Charanas (celestial bards) along
with great sages, forthwith approached Rama and consecrated him with very splendid waters
separately.

Shlok 87: The celestials, Siddhas and others exalted Rama, who was duly respected by kings
with their auspicious -words as follows: " O, king! Defeat the enemies. Rule the earth and ocean
eternally for years."



SARGA 23
------------------------------

[Text] Rama explains to Lakshmana the various portents, he observes around him, that signal
a destructive war fare. He orders for formation of battalions in the army and surges forth together
with the battalions towards Lanka.

Shlok 1: Rama, who was well acquainted with portents, on seeing the portents around, embraced
Lakshmana and spoke as follows:

Shlok 2: "O, Lakshmana! Acquiring this region endowed with cold water and woods abounding in
fruits, let us speedily divide this multitude of forces into battalions and drawing it up in battle
array, we shall stand attentive."

Shlok 3: "I perceive an impending danger which will be terrific, causing destruction to the
world, and torture to the eminent heroes among bears monkeys and demons."

Shlok 4: "Winds are blowing with dust and earth is trembling. Mountain- tops are quivering
and trees are falling down."

Shlok 5: "Ferocious clouds resembling wild beasts were dirty colored and emit a terrific
roaring and let loose dreadful showers mingled with drops of blood."

Shlok 6: "Evening twilight resembling red sandal wood is very much dreadful. From the blazing
sun, balls of fire fall."

Shlok 7: "Wild animals and birds from all sides are roaring pitiably with melancholic sound,
facing towards the sun in great fear."

Shlok 8: "The splendorous moon as though rising at the time of universal dissolution,
invested with a black and red halo is tormenting the mind this night."

Shlok 9: "O, Lakshmana! A dark stain appears on the cloudless solar disc, which is
diminished, dreary, inauspicious and coppery."

Shlok 10: "O, Lakshmana! Look! Stars enveloped in enormous dust, appear to announce a
dissolution of the world."

Shlok 11: "Crows, eagles and vultures are flying low. Jackals too are howling very dreadful
and inauspicious sounds."

Shlok 12: "Earth will become a quagmire of flesh and blood, covered with rocks spears and
swords hurled by monkeys and demons."

Shlok 13: "Abounding with all the monkeys we shall attack the city ruled by Ravana, now itself
at a quick pace."

Shlok 14: Rama the lord, the conqueror of enemies and a charming man thus speaking, wielded a
bow and sallied forth in front, facing towards Lanka.

Shlok 15: All those excellent monkeys, together with Vibhishana and Sugriva making roaring
sounds surged forth for the destruction of the audacious enemies.

Shlok 16: Rama on his part was pleased by the act and gestures of those very strong monkeys,
with their intention to gratify him.



SARGA 24
------------------------------

[Text] Seeing Lanka and describing it, Rama instructs Lakshmana to draw up his army in
battle array. Rama orders for release of Shuka who was captured by the army earlier. Shuka
approaches Ravana and describes the strength of Rama's side of the army. Ravana boasts himself of
his own army's strength.

Shlok 1: That army of valiant monkeys along with the king Sugriva looked charming like a full
moon night in autumn presided over by the moon and illuminated by bright stars.

Shlok 2: The earth pressed under foot by that multitude of army which was energetic like a
sea, was trembled with fear by the rapid movement of that army.

Shlok 3: Then the monkeys heard a great tumult arising in Lanka and noisy sounds of
kettledrums and tabours, which caused their hair to stand on end.

Shlok 4: The leaders of monkeys were rejoiced by that sound. But by not tolerating that
sound, they emitted shouts, which surpassed that uproar.

Shlok 5: Those demons too heard the roaring of the wildly delighted monkeys, which roar
sounded like thundering of clouds in the sky.

Shlok 6: Seeing Lanka dressed with multi colored flags and buntings, Rama bethought himself
of Sita and his heart was filled with grief.

Shlok 7: "Sita whose eyes resemble those of a young deer, was detained by Ravana there, as
Rohini star is overshadowed by the red bodied planet (mars)."

Shlok 8: Seeing Lakshmana after a warm and deep sigh, the heroic Rama spoke the following
words, which were beneficial for him at that time :-

Shlok 9: "O, Lakshmana! Look at this Lanka, which appears as though constructed on a hilltop
by Visvakarma with his imagination and so elevated scraping the sky."

Shlok 10: The city of Lanka was constructed densely with many seven storied buildings and
appears like a sky the abode of Vishnu (the all pervaded), covered with white clouds."

Shlok 11: "Lanka is made beautiful by the garden vying with chaitraratha (the garden of Kubera
the god of riches) with songs of birds of various species, with fruit bearing flowers and charms in
bloom.

Shlok 12: "See how a gentle breeze sways the branches where the cuckoos abound where bees
swarm and where the birds are excited with joy."

Shlok 13: Rama the son of Dasaratha spoke as aforesaid to Lakshmana. The army there was
divided into battalions according to the procedure found in scriptures.

Shlok 14: He issued the following commands: --"Taking these troops of monkeys from the army,
let the valiant and the invincible Angada take up his position with Nila at the center of the
formation.

Shlok 15: Let Rishabha along with the multitude of monkeys take up his position, having
recourse to the right side of the army."

Shlok 16: "Let Gandhamadana, the strong and unconquerable, resembling an elephant in rut, take
his position superintending the left side of the monkey troops."

Shlok 17: "I shall stand alert in the forefront of the army along with Lakshmana. Let
Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi the monkey - those three exceeding wise leaders of bears and
monkeys- protest the belly portion of the army."

Shlok 18: "Let Sugriva the king of monkeys protect the rear guard of the army, resembling
Varuna (the god of water) who remains enveloped with splendor protects the western quarter of the
earth."

Shlok 19: That army with innumerable divisions, being skillfully distributed led by the
foremost of monkeys, resembled heavens with their mass of clouds.

Shlok 20: With a desire to crush the demons in battle, the monkeys, seizing peaks of mountains
and gigantic trees, reached Lanka.

Shlok 21: All the heroic monkeys held the following resolve in their minds, "It is with peak
of mountains or with our bare fists even, we shall shatter this Lanka into pieces."

Shlok 22: Then, Rama with great splendor spoke the following words to Sugriva, "Our forces are
properly marshaled. Let this Shuka be released."

Shlok 23: Hearing the words of Rama, Sugriva the lord of monkeys released Shuka the messenger,
as per the order of Rama.

Shlok 24: Shuka who was harassed by the monkeys and released then as per the words of Rama,
was trembling with great fear and reached Ravana.

Shlok 25- 26: Ravana, even while laughing, enquired Shuka with the following words: " why were
your wings tied up? You appear with your wings plucked up. Have you not fallen as a victim to their
various fickle minds?"

Shlok 27- 28: Asked as aforesaid by the king Ravana, Shuka agitated as he was with fear, gave him
the following excellent reply: "On the northern shore of the ocean, I conveyed your message in a
smooth tone, conciliating and without any ambiguity exactly as per your instructions."

Shlok 29: "Just on seeing me, the enraged monkeys jumped on me and seized me. They soon
started beating and plucking me with their fists."

Shlok 30: "O, Lord of demons! Those monkeys are not capable of being spoken to, or possible of
being questioned in this matter. Monkeys, by their very nature, are angry and ferocious."

Shlok 31: "That Rama the killer of Viraadha, Kabandha and Khara came along with Sugriva to the
place of Sita."

Shlok 32: "Having constructed a bridge across the sea and crossed the salty ocean and
expelling the demons, here stands Rama wielding a bow."

Shlok 33: "Thousands of divisions of hordes of bears and monkeys resembling mountains and
clouds, cover the earth."

Shlok 34: "There is no more possibility of an alliance between these two armies - the army of
demons and the army of monkeys- than between a God and a demon."

Shlok 35: "Very soon they will come to our rampart. Immediately, do any one of these two acts-
either to restore Sita or to offer a combat to him."

Shlok 36: Hearing the words of Shuka, Ravana with his eyes becoming blood red in anger, as if
he would consume him with his glance, said as follows:

Shlok 37: "Even if I were frightened by all the worlds or even if I were to face a battle with
celestials or Gandharvas (celestial singers) or demons, I would not give back Sita."

Shlok 38: "When will my arrows soon fall upon Rama, as large black bees excited with joy fall
upon a tree in bloom at spring time?"

Shlok 39: "When shall I consume his body flowing with blood, by the blazing arrows released
from my bow, as flaming torches destroy an elephant?"

Shlok 40: "Endowed with a huge army I shall eclipse the aforesaid army of Rama, as the
brilliance of all stars is obscured at the rising of the sun."

Shlok 41: "My rashness is like that of the sea and my strength is like that of the wind. Rama
is not aware of it. That is why, he is desirous of meeting me in a combat."

Shlok 42: "Rama has not seen my arrows resembling venomous serpents lying in my quiver. That
is why, he desires to fight with me."

Shlok 43- 44: Rama was not formerly aware of my prowess in battle. I shall cause to resound Vina
(a musical instrument) in the form of my bow, which is played on with the heads of my arrows, the
bow string producing a tumultuous sound, the huge cries of the wounded its terrible accompaniment,
the darts sounding its innumerable notes, when I enter a vast stage in the form of my enemy ranks
in that battle."

Shlok 45: "Neither by the thousand eyed Indra the god of celestials nor by Varuna the God of
waters in person in a combat, nor by Yama the god of death with the fire of his arrows, nor by
Kubera the lord of riches in person, can I be able to be attacked in a great battle."



SARGA 25
------------------------------

[Text] While Rama crossed over to the other shore of the sea, Ravana instructs his
ministers, Suka and Sarana to enter the enemy's army in disguise and to bring all the required
information about them. When Suka and Sarana entered the enemy's ranks, Vibhishana recognises and
captures them. But Rama sets them free. Going back to Ravana, they explain the might strength of
the enemy's ranks and exhort him to restore Seetha to Rama.

Shlok 1: While Rama, the son of Dasaratha, crossed the ocean along with his army, the
illustrious Ravana spoke to Shuka and Sarana, his ministers as follows:

Shlok 2: "The entire army of monkeys crossed the impassable ocean. The construction of the
bridge, unprecedented, across the ocean was executed by Rama."

Shlok 3: "I am not able to believe under any circumstances that a pass-way has been
constructed across the ocean. Certainly, that army of monkeys is worth to be counted (carried
weight) by me."

Shlok 4- 5- 6- 7: "Become unrecognisable to others, enter the army of monkeys and make out the real
quantum of their army, their prowess, as to which monkeys are important among them, which ministers
of Rama and Sugreeva have come together, which monkeys are abiding in front, which monkeys are
valiant, how that bridge was constructed across the ocean full of water, how the encamping is done
for those great-souled monkeys; the determination, strength and the striking senses of Rama and of
the heroic Lakshmana."

Shlok 8: "Knowing also accurately who the Chief of Army of those high-souled monkeys is, you
have to come back quickly."

Shlok 9: Having thus been commanded by Ravana, the valiant demons Shuka and Sarana , both in
the disguise of monkeys, entered that army of monkeys.

Shlok 10: Shuka and Sarana were not able to count then that inconeviable army of monkeys,
causing their hair to stand on end.

Shlok 11- 12: That army was stationed on the tops of mountains, round about the waterfalls, in the
caves, on the sea-shores, in the woodlands and in the gardens. It was either in the process of
crossing the ocean, or was intending to cross it in its entirety. It had either encamped or was
still encamping, making a terrible noise. The two demons saw that very strong and imperturbable sea
of army.

Shlok 13: Vibhishana with great splendour beheld both of them in disguise. He caught hold of
Shuka and Sarana and told Rama as follows:

Shlok 14: "O, Rama the conqueror of hostile citadels! These two demons are Shuka and Sarana,
the ministers of Ravana and they came here as spies from Lanka."

Shlok 15: Both of them, having seen Rama, were trembled with fear, without any hope for their
lives and having joined their palms, spoke the following words:

Shlok 16: "O, excellent man! O, Rama! We both of us, as sent by Ravana, came here together to
know everything about your entire army."

Shlok 17: Hearing their aforesaid words, Rama the son of Dasaratha who was interested in the
welfare of all beings, smilingly spoke the following words:

Shlok 18: "Has the entire army been observed by you? Have you observed us well? Have you
accomplished the task, as entrusted to you? If so, you may go back now according to your free
will."

Shlok 19: "Even if you have not seen something you may see it now also. Otherwise, Vibhishana
will show it to you again entirely."

Shlok 20: "You, having been caught, need not fear about your life. The captured messengers
holding no weapons indeed deserve no killing."

Shlok 21: "O, Vibhishana! Always try to draw a bow-string on the opponents and not on these
two demons. Set them both, who are spies in disguise, free."

Shlok 22: "When you return to the city of Lanka, repeat my words faithfully to Ravana the
younger half-brother of Kubera and the king of demons."

Shlok 23: "That force on which you relied when you were taking away Seetha from me, display
that force at your will along with your troops and allies."

Shlok 24: "Tomorrow, at break of day, you will see my arrows demolish the city of Lanka with
its ramparts and arches as well as the army of demons."

Shlok 25: "O, Ravana! Tomorrow, at break of day I will cast my dreadful anger on you and your
army as Indra the Lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt casts the thunderbolt on demons."

Shlok 26- 27: Receiving this command, the two demons, Shuka and Sarana, admiring his justice,
cried out: "May you be victorious!", reached the city of Lanka and spoke to Ravana as follows:

Shlok 28: "O, king of demons! We were seized by Vibhishana with the intention of killing us.
But, Rama, the pious minded wose valour is immeasurable, seeing us, set us free."

Shlok 29- 20- 31: "Where the four eminent persons who are equal to the protector of the worlds, the
valiant ones skilled in the use of weapons and of proven prowess namely Rama the son of Dasaratha,
the illustrious Lakshmana, the great resplendent Vibhishana and Sgreeva whose valour is equal to
Indra the Lord of celestials, arestationed at the same place, they can pluck up the city of Lanka
with its ramparts and arches and transplant it elswhere, even if all the monkeys keep aloof."

Shlok 32: "Such is Rama's form and such are his weapons, that he can alone overthrow the city
of Lanka, his three other companious standing by."

Shlok 33: "That army protected by Rama and Lakshmana as well as Sugreeva, are exceedingly
unconquerable even by all the gods and demons."

Shlok 34: "Now, the army of the mighty monkeys, who are readily inclined to fight, consists of
cheerful warriors. Mae peace, insted of enmity with them. Restore Seetha to Rama."



SARGA 26
------------------------------

[Text] Hearing the submission of Sarana, Ravana climbs up the roof of his palace and sees
the entire army of monkeys from there. Ravana enquires about the various monkey leaders and Sarana
shows him Nila, Angada, Nala, Sweta, Kumuda, Rambha, Sarabha, Panasa, Vinata and Krathana the
army-generals along with their distinguishing characterestics.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words, which were truthful and coward less, as spoken by Sarana, the
king Ravana spoke to Sarana as follows:

Shlok 2: "I do not give Seetha even if the celestials, celestial musicians or demons attack
me or even if there is a terror from all the worlds."

Shlok 3: "O, gentle one! As you were harassed very much by the monkeys and hence fearful; you
are thingking of giving back Seetha now itself as good."

Shlok 4- 5: "Which enemy can defeat me in battle?" The illustrious Ravana, the lord of demons,
causing the world to cry, spoke harsh words as aforesaid and then from there ascended the roof of
his palace which was shining white like his snow and which was equal to the height his snow and
which was equal to the height of several palmyrah trees, with a desire to see the army of
monkeys.

Shlok 6: Ravana, stupefied with anger, along with his spies, saw that ocean, the mountains
and the forests and beheld the entire land completely filled with monkeys.

Shlok 7: Seeing that great army of monkeys, which was boundless and intolerable, the king
Ravana asked Sarana as follows:-

Shlok 8: "Which monkeys are important among them? Who are valiant ones? Who are the very
strong ones? Who will stay in front at all places, with great energy?"

Shlok 9: "To whom Sugreeva will hear? Who are the generals of the commanders of the
monkey-heads? What is the influence of the monkeys? O, Sarana! Tell me all."

Shlok 10: Then, Sarana who knew the chiefs of monkeys, spoke the following words about the
chiefs of the monkeys i them, to the lord of demons who was enquiring about them.

Shlok 11- 12- 13: "He, the valiant one, who holds his arms high, who tramples the earth under his feet
as he marches, whose face is turned towards Lanka, who in fury is knitting his brows very much, who
is resembling a mountain- peak in stature, who is like filaments of a louts in hue, who is excess
of anger continuously lashes out his tail and the swish of which is heard in ten regions, he is the
prince named Angada, anointed by Sugreeva the king of monkeys and is challenging you to the
battle."

Shlok 14- 15- 16- 17: "He, the valiant one, who holds his arms high, who tramples the earth under his feet
as he marches, whose face is turned towards Lnaka, who in fury is knitting his brows very much, who
is remsebling amountain- peak in stature, who is like filaments ofa louts in hue, who is excess of
anger continuously lashes out his tail and the swish of hwich is heard in ten regious, he is the
prince named Angada, anointed by Sugreeva the king of monkeys and is challenging you to the
battle."

Shlok 18: "This Angada, a worthy son of Vali and always dear to Sugreeva, is coming forwards
for Rama's interests, as Varuna is to Indra's."

Shlok 19: "It is all due to Angada's design that Seetha was found by Hanuman, who is a swift
monkey and a well-wisher of Rama."

Shlok 20: "This valiant Angada, bringing along with him innumerable cheifs of monkeys, is
approaching to crush you, with the help of his own army."

Shlok 21: "Surrounded by a large army, here stands the valiant Nala the creator of the bridge,
next to Angada the son of Vali, prepared for the battle."

Shlok 22- 23- 24: "These excellent monkeys, numbering a thousand crores and eight lakhs, lodging in
sandalwood groves, yelling with a lion's roar and having stiffened their limbs, are knitting their
eye=brows raised in anger. These valiant monkeys, who are terrific and fierceful having a feroceous
zeal are going after Nala. Nala himself with his aforesaid army aspires to smash Lanka
forthwith."

Shlok 25- 26: "A monkey called Sweta of sivlver hue who is quick-witted and cleaver, of terricfic
prowess and a warrior renowned in the three worlds, has come to Sugreeva swiftly, dividing the army
of monkeys and brining great delight to the troops, he goes back at once."

Shlok 27- 28- 29- 30: "There was mountain called Ramya, on the banks of River Gomati. That mountain filled
with various kinds of trees was also called Samrochana. An army-chief, named Kumuda used to roam
around that mountainous region. He also used to rule that kingdom. He is the leader for lakhs of
monkeys. He has a very long hair-coppery, yellow, pale and white and hideous to cook upon- thrown
about on his tail is the intrepid and fierceful monkey called Kanda. He yearns to fight and boast
that he with destroy Lanka his forces."

Shlok 31- 32- 33: "O, king! He who resembles a tawny lion with a long mane and who is looking at Lanka
attentively as though he wishes to consume it with his glasses, who dwells mostly on the mountains
of Krishna and Sahya of Vindhya range of pleasing aspect, is the General named Rambha. Three
thousand crores of excellent monkeys, who are formidable of impetuous valour and vigour, surround
him who is marching ahead and follow in his goot-sets to destroy Lanka."

Shlok 34- 35- 36: "O, king! Look! The one who is yawning continuously and shaking his ears, he who
does not have fear of death, he who never retreats from a battle, but violently moves with rage,
who again sees obliquely, he who lashes out his tail and roars like a lion with great vigour, he
who constantly dwells on the lovely Salveya mountain, he is Sarabha by name, the commander of
monkeys with immense energy and devoid of fear."

Shlok 37: "O, king! All his one lakh and forty thousand army-chiefs called Viharas* are
strong.

[Commentary] *Viharas - Those who roam about at will.

Shlok 38- 39- 40: "The one who is like a great cloud, enveloping the space and who stays in teh middle
of monkey-warriors like Indra the god of celestials, the great voice of whose monkeys wishing for
battle is heard like the roll of drums, is the General named Panasa, who is always invincible in
battle. He dwells in Pariyatra, a mountain that is exceeded by none in height."

Shlok 41: Troop-commanders numbering fifty lakhs commanding separate units attend obediently
to him, who is excellent among the Generals."

Shlok 42- 43- 44: "He who is encamped with sixty lakhs monkeys as his army-strength on the sea-shore
like unto a second ocean is the commander called Vinata who resembles Dardura mountain (in size)
and is positioned there lending charm to the formidable army marching ahead and moves about,
drinking the water of River Vena, the foremost of all rivers."

Shlok 45: "A monkey called krathana, keeping the courageous, strong monkeys and the
army-lieutenants in separate units, is inviting you for the battle."

Shlok 46: "That resplendent monkey who for his part nourishes his body having the hue of a red
chalk and proud of his strength, stands facing you with anger despising all other monkeys."

Shlok 47: "Seventy lakhs monkeys are attending on him. He himself wishes to crush the city of
Lanka with the help of his army."

Shlok 48: "These commanders and commanders-in-chief are difficult to be conquered and their
number is hard to be counted. Their troops are divided into distinct units."



SARGA 27
------------------------------

[Text] Sharana continues to describe the individual strengths of the various commanders in
the army of monkeys, mentioning their names one by one, in detail.

Shlok 1: "I on my part shall tell you, who are keenly observing about those army-chiefs, who
are ready to show their valour in the case of Rama, even without caring for their lives."

Shlok 2-3: "He is a monkey called Hara, who has terrific acts to his credit. The hair on his
tail, measuring many fathoms, soft, red in colour, yellow, white and super-white, wavery and
shining like the rays of the sun standing erect thrown about are dragging along the ground."

Shlok 4: "Hundreds and thousands of troop-leaders who are resolved to be the servants of
Sugreeva rally behind him, carrying trees with them and with an intention to attack Lanka
soon."

Shlok 5- 6- 7: "O, king! Those who appear black like black-clouds and akin to black collyrium are
extremely ferocious bears, truly mighty in combat, which are in exceedingly large number,
indefinable like the other shore of an ocean, whom you are observing and serve of whom reside in
mountains, plains and on river-banks. They are all coming towards you."

Shlok 8- 9: "O, king! He who is standing in the middle, with terrific eyes and of fearful
appearance, encircled by all like Parjanya (the rain-god) being encircled by clouds; is the
army-chief called Dhumra, the Lord of all bears, who drinks the waters of River Narmada and resides
on an excellent mountain named Rikshavanta."

Shlok 10- 11: "See him who is appearing like a mountain the younger brother of Dhumra, though in
form resembling like his brother, is more distinguished in prowess. He as such is a commander of
even the mighty generals called Jambavan, who is setting on the march (for the battle). He has a
respectful behaviour towards venerable persons impatient in battle."

Shlok 12: By the intelligent Jambavan, a great help was rendered to Indra (the lord of
celestials) in a battle between celestials and demons and many boons were obtained."

Shlok 13- 14: "Jambavan's giant bodied troops, resembling demons and devils, having thick hair and
endowed with unlimited energy, wander about, climbing mountain-heights and hurl massive rocks as
big as huge clouds. They do not have a fear in facing death."

Shlok 15- 16: "O, king! This Lord of monkeys- the commander of commanders on whom, whether he is
in a hurried fury or leaping or standing still and all the monkeys stand looking - he is called
Dambha who along with his bulky troops dwell on Sahasraksha mountain."

Shlok 17- 18- 19: "He who, walking on all fours touches with his flanks, a mountain situated at a
distance of one Yojana (eight miles) and reaching an object one Yojana high, obtains it with his
body, whose huge form no other four-begged animal is having, by which intelligent monkey, battle
was given earlier to Indra the Lord of celestials on a field of battle but no defeat was sustained
by him, he is a commander of commanders and the grand-father of monkeys, famous as Samnadana by
name."

Shlok 20: "This Samnada, whose striding prowess is equal to that of Indra the Lord of
Celestials was born of a youthful Gandharva maiden and krishnavartman for the purpose of helping
the celestials in a combat between celestials and demoneous."

Shlok 21- 22- 23: "O king of demons! This commander named Krathana, the son of Visravasa, the
illustrious one, sits beneath the Jambu tree, on that mountain, the king of peaks, which is
frequented by Kinneras, and which mountain affords delight constantly to your brother. It is near
there, Krathana, that fortunate one, that powerful lord of the monkeys, whose prowess in not
confined to words in battles, sports."

Shlok 24: "He indeed is standing, surrounded by a thousand crores of monkeys. He hopes to
crush Lanka with the help of his army."

Shlok 25- 26: "He who usually roams by the Ganges, sowing terror among leaders of herds of
elephants, remembering as he does the old quarrel between elephants and monkeys, thundering and
uprooting trees, he is the commander and leader of monkeys called Pramathim who dwells in
mountain-caves, subduing wild elephants."

Shlok 27: "This excellent one among the monkeys and this army-chief of monkeys, taking shelter
in Mandara the foremost of mountains and the mountain called ushirabija alongside the River Ganga,
passes his life happily like unto Indra himself."

Shlok 28: "A hundred thousands of monkeys; proud of their strength and prowess with their
radiant fore-arms, making a roaring noise, are following him."

Shlok 29: "He is the leader of these high-soled monkeys. O, king! He is the commander called
Pramathi, the one difficult to be conquered."

Shlok 30- 31: "He whom you are beholding a cloud raised by wind is Pramathi. At that place, a
great quantity of red illumined dust is tossed about and raised by wind in various ways in
different directions. Energetic and excited army of monkeys is also stationed there along with
Pramathi."

Shlok 32- 33: "O, monarch! One hundred lakhs of monkeys with their black faces, with fearful
appearance and with great strength, experiencing the crossing of the bridge, surrounds the
troop-leader by name Gavaksha, a monkey and are making a roaring noise, ready to crush Lanka by
their bodily strength."

Shlok 34- 35- 36- 37: "O, king! This army-chief called Kesari, the chief of the commanders of monkeys,
wanders in Kanchana mountain wherein there are trees which yield fruits in all seasons, inhabited
by large black-bees, to which the sun circumambulates clock-wise, the mountain shining with its own
colour and splendour, by whose brightness, the animals and birds ever shine with the same hue,
whose table-land on the top of the mountain the great sages do not leave, wherein trees, all
mango-trees laden with fruits on all sides and wherein inhabit honey-bees of excellent
variety."

Shlok 38- 39- 40- 41- 42: "O, faultless king! There are sixty thousand mountains in that beautiful golden
mountain ranges. There is an excellent mountain the middle of that mountain range as you the middle
of that demons. In that mountain range there, in the last mountain these monkeys reside. Some of
the monkeys are tawny coloured, some are white-coloured and with nails as their weapons; having
four tusks, with nails as their weapons having four tusks like lions, difficult to be approached
like tigers, resembling fire, like unto serpents vomiting poison with their very long coiling
tails, resembling elephants in rut, equal to mighty mountains and making great thunderous sound
like that of clouds. All of them stand looking on your Lanka as if they are about to crush it."

Shlok 43- 44: "O, king! He who stands in the middle is the powerful leader of the monkeys who ever
faces the sun, who is a wise man, eager to conquer you and is famous in the world by the name,
Shatabali. He swears to destroy Lanka with his troops."

Shlok 45: "This Shatabali the monkey is courageous, strong, valiant and is established in his
manliness. He does not care for his life, in the cause of Rama."

Shlok 46: "Each and every single one, like Gaja, Gavaya, Nala and a monkey called Nila is
surrounded by crores of warriors."

Shlok 47: "Besides, other excellent monkeys residing in Vindhya mountain are quick-paced and
are impossible to be counted because of their multitude."

Shlok 48: "O, monarch! All of them are highly prominent, their stature equal to high hills and
all of them are capable in a moment to level the earth by uprooting and razing its mountains earth
by uprooting and razing its mountains to the ground."



SARGA 28
------------------------------

[Text] Shuka in his turn enumerates the enemies and completes the account given by
Sarana.

Shlok 1: After listening to Sarana's words Shuka, pointing out all that army of monkeys,
spoke the following words to Ravana the Lord of Demons.

Shlok 2- 3: "O, king! Do you observe those monkeys resembling huge elephants in rut, rising like
banyan trees on the banks of River Ganga or Sala trees on Himalayas? Those warriors, able to change
their form at will, are irresistible, equal to celestials and demons, and in a battle, are endowed
with the valour of the gods."

Shlok 4: "There are twenty one thousand crores, a thousand Shankus and a hundred Vrindas of
these monkeys."

[Commentary] The number exactly corresponding to a Shanku and a Vrinda should be understood
as calculated at the end of this chapter.

Shlok 5: "These monkeys, the attendants of Sugreeva born of celestials and celestial
musicians, are able to change their form at will and always stay in Kishkindha."

Shlok 6: "The two who stand there, who have the same resemblance and have the appearance of
celestials, are Mainda and Dvivida. None can equal them in combat."

Shlok 7: "These two, who ate ambrosion on due authorization by Brahma, are hopefully of
destroying Lanka by their power."

Shlok 8- 9: "As for that monkey who you see there, resembling an intoxicated elephant, who in
strength and fury is able to churn up the ocean itself, it is he who came to Lanka to find Seetha
and spy on you, O, Lord! See that monkey, who was seen earlier and who appears here again."

Shlok 10: "This monkey, by whom the ocean was traversed, is the eldest son of Kesari. He is
known as the son of wind-god and famously called as Hanuman."

Shlok 11: "This excellent monkey can assume any form at will. He is endowed with a good
strength and form always moving like the wind-god, having an uninterrupted mobility."

Shlok 12- 13: "While yet a child, seeing the sun rise, he desired to eat it and took off to a
distance of three thousand yojanas (or twenty four thousand miles) reflecting: ï¿½I shall seize hold
of the sun and my hunger will not be appeased otherwise' and they say, he leapt up (into the air)
intoxicated as he was with his own strength."

Shlok 14: "Without even reaching the sun, which is most unassailable even to celestials, sages
or demons, he however fell on a mountain, where that radiant orb rises."

Shlok 15: "One of the jaws of this monkey who fell down on the head of the rock, was a little
fractured. For this reason, because of his strong jaw, he is called Hanuma."

Shlok 16: "This monkey is known to me actually through the words of my bosom friends. It is
not possible to describe his strength or physical form or glory."

Shlok 17: "He alone wants to destroy Lanka by his valour. How do you forget this monkey by
whom this fire was lighted and is still blazing up Lanka."

Shlok 18- 19- 20- 21: "Nearby is a warrior, dark of hue with eyes like lotuses, a chief warrior among
Ikshvakus, his heroism is well-known in the world, his sense of duty never wavers, nor does he ever
transgress the righteousness, he knows to loose Brahma's weapon and is conversant with Veda, he is
the most learned of the Vedic scholars, he shatters the firmament with his arrows, and rends even
the earth, his anger is akin to that of Death, his valour equal to that of Indra the god of
celestials, his consort is Seetha who was taken away by you from a place called Janasthana, he is
Rama who has come to wage war on you, O king!"

Shlok 22- 23: "This man, having the radiance of pure gold, with a broad chest, having red eyes,
with black and curled hair, standing at the right side of Rama, he is called Lakshmana, who is
interested in the care and welfare of his brother, skilled in leadership of combat and excellent
among the wielders of all weapons."

Shlok 24: This Lakshmana is an angry person, difficult to be conquered, victorious, wise and
mighty. He has always been the right arm of Rama and in outward moving life (of Rama).

Shlok 25: "He does not indeed care for his life in the cause of Rama. He alone wishes to kill
all the demons in battle."

Shlok 26: "He who is standing there, taking guard at the left side of Rama, surrounded by a
troop of demons he is the king Vibhishana."

Shlok 27: "He, who was consecrated as a king for Lanka by the illustrious Rama, the king of
kings, is enraged really with you and is to attack us in the battle."

Shlok 28- 29- 30- 31- 32: "The other whom you see as an unshakable mountain and standing in the centre of
monkeys as a Lord of all chiefs of monkeys, with a boundless energy and who, like a Himalayan hill,
very much radiating the other monkeys by his splendour, glory, wisdom, strength and his noble
descent, who occupies along with the chiefs of Army Generals, a secret place called Kishkindha,
with its forests and trees and the place inaccessible because of its impassable mountains, in which
is established a good fortune of celestials and human beings, whose charming and golden coloured
garland with hundred lotuses is beautifying, that person is Sugreeva. This garland along with a
lady called Tara as well as the permanent kingdom of monkeys were presented to him by Rama after
having killed Vali (Sugreeva's brother)."

Shlok 33: "Wise men call a hundred lakhs as a crore. A hundred thousand crores is reckoned as
a Shanku."

Shlok 34- 35- 36- 37- 38: "A hundred thousand Shankus are said to be one Maha Shanku. A hundred thousand Maha
Shankus are called one Vrindam here. A hundred thousand Vrindas are said to be one Maha vrindam. A
hundred thousand Mahavrindas are called one Padmam here. A hundred thousand padmas are said to be
one Mahapadmam. A hundred thousand Mahapadmas are called one Kharvam here. A hundred thousand
kharvas are said to be one Mahakharvam. A hundred thousand Mahakharvas are called one Samundram. A
hundred thousand Samudras are said to be one ogha here. A hundred thousand oghas are acclaimed a
one Mahaugha."

Shlok 39- 40- 41- 42- 43: "This Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, having great strength and valour, always
surrounded by a colossal army, is approaching you to make war, accompanied by the valiant
Vibhishana and the ministers, as also a hundred thousand crores of Shankas, a thousand Mahashankus,
a hundred Vrindas, a thousand mahavrindas, a hundred padmas, a thousand Mahapadmas, a hundred
kharves, samudras and Mahaughas of the same number, and a crore of Mahanghas wholearmy as such is
identical of an ocean."

Shlok 44: "O, king! Carefully observing this army, which appears much the same as a blazing
planet, prepare yourself for a great effort to get victory and take measures to avoid defeat from
the enemies."



SARGA 29
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana reprimands Shuka and Sarana, asking them to leave the assembly. He again
sends some spies to the place of Rama and Lakshmana. Those spies were got caught by Vibhishana and
the monkeys start harassing them. But the compassionate Rama gets them released and the spies reach
back Lanka.

Shlok 1- 2- 3- 4- 5: Beholding those foremost of monkey leaders pointed out by Shuka- the most valiant
Lakshmana; Rama's right arm, his own brother Vibhishana standing close to Rama, the terribly
powerful Sugreeva the king of all monkeys, the strong Angada grandson of Indra the wielder of
thunderbolt, the powerful Hanuman, the imincible Jambavan, Sushena, Kumuda, Nila, Nala the
excellent of monkeys, Gaja, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Mainda and Dvivida- that Ravana - his heart became
agitated a little, was enraged and then abused those two heroes Shuka and Sarana who had completed
their report.

Shlok 6: Ravana spoke (the following) excited and harsh words, in a voice choked in anger to
Shuka and Sarana who stood saluting with their faces bent down.

Shlok 7: "It is not befitting to utter unpleasant words by dependent ministers to their king
who has the power to mete out any punishment or reward."

Shlok 8: "Is it proper for both of you to shower irrelevant praise on our enemies who are
adverse to us and are approaching for a war?"

Shlok 9: "In vain have you sat at the feet of your elders, your preceptors and the aged,
since the essence to be followed from political sciences has not been grasped by both of you."

Shlok 10: "Or if you have imbibed them, you have not remembered them. You are over-burdened
with ignorance! Being associated with such foolish ministers, it is a miracle that I am still able
to retain my sovereignty."

Shlok 11: "Have you no fear of death that you dare address me thus rudely, I whose tongue that
you dare tongue dispenses good and evil?"

Shlok 12: "Trees may survive in the forest, even if disturbed by fire. But the guilty cannot
survive, if touched by the royal scepter."

Shlok 13: "If my anger is not softened by the services they rendered earlier, I would have
killed thse two miscreants who are praising the band of enemies."

Shlok 14: "Keep away from my neighbourhood. Do not be seen anywhere here. I am recollecting
your past services and hence do not wish to kill you. Both of you, who are ungrateful and
unfaithful towards me, are just as dead to me."

Shlok 15: Hearing Ravana's words, Shuka and Sarana felt ashamed to see Ravana paid obeisance
to him saying, "Be thou victorious!" and went away.

Shlok 16: The demon Ravana spoke to Mahodara who was standing nearby as follows: "Bring me the
spies here quickly."

Shlok 17- 18: Hearing those words, Mahodara immediately ordered for the spies. The spies came
hurriedly as per the orders of the king, paid obeisance to him by joining their palms and
approached him, having made a complement expressing their desire to see him victorious.

Shlok 19: Then, Ravana the king of demons spoke the following words to those spies, who were
faithful, brave, energetic and free from fear:

Shlok 20: "You go from here to investigate about the first impression concerning Rama, as
regards who are his intimate friends and in respect of those who joined on his side with a liking
towards him."

Shlok 21: "Find out what are his hours of sleeping and waking and what he intends to do next.
You ought to come here, after acquainting with all this information completely and skillfully."

Shlok 22: "An enemy in battle, got known through spies by kings, will be defeated with only a
little of effort."

Shlok 23: Those spies on their part delightfully replied, "May it be so", kept Shardula in
their front and made their circumambulation clockwise around Ravana.

Shlok 24: Having thus made circumambulation to Ravana the excellent and the distinguished
demon, the spies went to the place where Rama along with Lakshmana were there.

Shlok 25: Having gone in a disguised manner, those spies saw Rama and Lakshman together with
Sugreeva and Vibhishana in the neighbourhood of Mountain Suvela.

Shlok 26: Seeing that army, those demons became overwhelmed with fear. However, they were
observed by the high-souled Vibhishana the Lord of demons.

Shlok 27: Accidentally, the deomons there were caught by Vibhishana, who said that the demon
Shardula among them was wicked and got him alone seized.

Shlok 28: That Shardula also, who was going to be killed by the monkeys, was got released by
Rama. The other demons also were got released by Rama, the kind man.

Shlok 29: Those demons, harassed by the courageous and the quick-paced monkeys, became
insensible, heaved a sigh and reached back Lanka.

Shlok 30: Those spies, who always wander outside and who were valiant rangers of the night,
thereafter approached Ravana and informed him that Rama's army was camping in the vicinity of the
Suvela mountain.



SARGA 30
------------------------------

[Text] Dispatched by the king Ravana to ascertain the strength of the army in the
opposition-camp, Shardula the demon-spy acquaints his master with the important leaders of the
monkeys.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, the spies informed Ravana about Rama, with his unperturbable army,
having encamped on Suvela Mountain.

Shlok 2: Hearing from the spies about the arrival of Rama, the exceedingly strong man, Ravana
became a little perturbed and spoke to Shardula as follows:

Shlok 3: O, demon! Your complexion is not so as it should be. You look miserable too. I hope
that you have not fallen a victim to the enraged monkeys."

Shlok 4: Thus questioned by Ravana, Shardula afflicted with fear, then sluggishly spoke the
following words to Ravana the tiger among demons:

Shlok 5: "O, king! Those strong, bold and excellent monkeys protected by Rama are not capable
of being spied upon."

Shlok 6: "They are not capable of being talked with and nothing can be found in interrogating
with them. The entire path is being protected by the monkeys looking like mountains."

Shlok 7: "I was identified when that army was merely penetrated into (by me) and began to be
examined. I was seized forcibly by the demons (forming the retinue of Vibhishana), who investigated
me in various ways."

Shlok 8: "I was beaten on all sides with knees, fists, teeth and palms by the enraged
monkeys. I was also paraded round in the midst of their army."

Shlok 9: "Having been paraded all around thus, I was finally taken to the court of Rama. All
my limbs were bleeding and Rama. All my limbs were bleeding and I was trembling, with my senses
disturbed."

Shlok 10: "While being plagued by the monkeys and asked for protection with joined palms, I
was saved fortunately by Rama, saying ï¿½stay!stay!'

Shlok 11: "Rama has filled the sea with boulders and rocks, taking up his position at the
gates of Lanka and stands there, well-equipped with weapons."

Shlok 12: "Having released me, Rama of great splendour arranged the army in the form of Garuda
(an eagle). He is encircled on all sides by the monkeys and is approaching towards Lanka."

Shlok 13: "Before he reaches the ramparts, do one thing or the other quickly or give away
Seetha immediately or even offer him battle."

Shlok 14: Having heard those words, Ravana the lord of demons reflected on it and thereafter
spoke the following significant words to Shardula.

Shlok 15: "I will not give away Seetha even if the celestials or Gandharvas the celestial
musicians or the demons were to fight against me or even under danger from all beings."

Shlok 16: After uttering the aforesaid words, the heroic Ravana again spoke as follows: "Has
the army been espied by you? Who are the valiant monkeys among them?"

Shlok 17: "O, the virtuous gentle Shardula! What radiance do the monkeys, who are difficult to
be conquered possess of? what kind? Whose sons and grandsons are they? You tell me that
information."

Shlok 18: "After knowing their strengths and weakness, I will decide in this matter
accordingly. Is it not necessary to count clearly those who are really yearning to fight the
battle?"

Shlok 19: Hearing Ravana's words, Shardula the excellent spy then started to narrate these
words for Ravana's information:

Shlok 20: "Certainly, king Sugreeva, the son of Riksharajasa, is difficult to be conquered in
battle. Here is the son of Gadgada, famously called as Jambavan."

Shlok 21: "The other one is the son of the same Gadgada. Another one is the son of Brihaspati
the teacher of Indra the lord of celestials, called Kesari by whose son Hanuman the demons were
destroyed."

Shlok 22: "O, king! Here is Sushena the son of Yama the Lord of Death who is valiant and
virtuous, as well as a monkey called Dadhimukha, the cool-minded, who is the son of moon."

Shlok 23: "Sumukha, Durmukha and a monkey called Vegadarshi are surely the personifications of
death in the form of monkeys, created by Brahma, the Lord of creation."

Shlok 24: "Here is Nila the army-general himself, the son of Agni the Lord of Fire. Here is
the son of Vayu the Lord of Wind well- known as Hanuman."

Shlok 25- 26- 27: "The young Angada, Indra's grandson, the strong and invincible one, both the mighty
Mainda and Dvinda born of the two divinties of Ashvin* as well as Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha
and Gandhamadhana the five sons of Yama the God of Death all of them resembling Yama at the time of
dissolution of the world, the valiant ten crores of monkeys who are yearning for battle are all
here. I cannot venture to tell about the remaining glorious sons of god."

[Commentary] The two divinities of Ashvin are said to appear in the sky before the dawn in a
golden carriage drawn by horses or birds, they bring treasures to men and avert misfortune and
sickness; they are considered as the physicians of heaven.

Shlok 28: "This young man is Rama, Dasartha's son, who is well-built like a lion, by whom
Dushana ws killed as also Khara and Trishana.

Shlok 29: "There is no one on earth who is equal in prowess to Rama, by whom Viradha was
killed as also Kabandha who was equal to Yama."

Shlok 30: "No man on this earth is able to narrate the qualities of Rama, by whom all the
demons staying in Janasthana were killed."

Shlok 31: "Here too is the virtuous Lakshamana, resembling the most excellent elephant among
elephants, in the path of whose arrows, even Indra the Lord of celestials himself could not
survive

Shlok 32- 33: "Sweta and Jyotirmukha, the sons of the sun-god, a monkey called Hemakuta, another
son of Varuna, Nila the son of Visvakarma the strong and the best of monkeys, as well as that
mighty and swift Durdhara the son of Vasus are all here."

Shlok 34: "There is the prince of demons Vibhishana, your brother, who having secured the city
of Lanka (as a prospective gift from Rama) remains devoted to the good of Rama."

Shlok 35: "Thus, I have described about the entire army of monkeys stationed on the Mount
Suvela. Now, it is for you to decide what remains to be done!"



SARGA 31
------------------------------



Agitated to learn that Rama had arrived to Lanka and is stationed at Suvela 
			mountain along with his army, Ravana confers with his ministers and after dismissing them, 
			approaches Seetha with Vidyujjuha, knower of conjuring tricks. Informing Seetha that her 
			husband along with his army had been killed in battle, he produces before her an illusive 
			Rama's head along with bow and arrows created with Vidyujjuha's conjuring trick. Thus, Ravana 
			deceives Seetha about the death of Rama.

Shlok 1: The spies of king Ravana informed him that Rama with his imperturbable army 
			was encamped at Mount Suvela in Lanka.

Shlok 2: Hearing through his spies that Rama with his mighty army had arrived to Lanka, 
			Ravana was a little agitated and spoke to his counsellors as follows:

Shlok 3: "The time for deliberation has come to us. Let our ministerial colleagues 
			come quickly with their keenly attentive minds."

Shlok 4: As per his command, the ministers came instantly. Ravana conferred with the 
			ogres, his ministers.

Shlok 5: The dreadful Ravana discussed about the ensuing things to be done immediately. 
			He sent away the ministers and entered his palace.

Shlok 6: Thereafter, Ravana the practiser of conjuring tricks, took the exceedingly 
			strong Vidyujjihva who was a great sourcerer along with him and went to Seetha's place.

Shlok 7: Ravana the lord of demons spoke to Vidyujjihva, who was a knower of conjuring 
			tricks as follows: "With your spells, create an illusion in order to deceive Seetha, daughter 
			of Janaka."

Shlok 8: "O, demon! Produce a head resembling Rama's along with a great bow and arrows 
			created deceptively and present yourself before me."

Shlok 9: Hearing Ravana's words, the demon Vidyujjihva said, "Be it so". He showed 
			to Ravana those things of his conjuring trick, well-performed. The king became satisfied 
			of his work and gave him an ornament (as a gift).

Shlok 10: The exceedingly strong Ravana the suzerain lord of demons, duly entered the 
			Ashoka grove, eagerly longing for the sight of Seetha.

Shlok 11- 12: Then, Ravana the younger brother of Kubera ( the god of riches) saw Seetha 
			the unfortunate one, who did not deserve that fate, seated on the ground with her head bent 
			down in the Ashoka grove plunged in grief as she was and absorbed in the thought of her 
			husband.

Shlok 13: Then, approaching Seetha who was attended upon by ghastly ogresses seated 
			not far distance from her and mentioning his own name with great delight, Ravana spoke the 
			following audacious words to Seetha.

Shlok 14: "O, Beautiful one! He in whom you trusted and repelled me when I sought to 
			console you - that murderer of Khara, your husband Rama has been killed in battle."

Shlok 15: "O, Seetha! Your root has been cut off in all ways by me and your pride has 
			been slain. By your present evil predicament, you will become my wife."

Shlok 16: "O, Foolish one! Give up this resolution. What will you do with one dead. 
			O, beautiful one! Become the Chief Queen over all my consorts."

Shlok 17: "O, Foolish one, with scant virtue and failed purpose! You think yourself 
			as wise! O, Seetha! Hear about the dreadful killing of your husband in battle, as the killing 
			of the demon Vritra (at the hands of Indra)"

Shlok 18: "Rama, encircled by an extensive army led forward by Sugreeva, is said to 
			have arrived at the sea-shore, to kill me."

Shlok 19: "While sun was going to set, Rama with his mighty army was encamped there, 
			encroaching upon the northern shore of the sea."

Shlok 20: "Their army stationed there, comfortably asleep at the middle of the night 
			and completely fatigued in the course of the journey, was approached first and espied by 
			our spies."

Shlok 21: "By my great army, which was led by Prahasta, Rama's army was killed in the 
			night at the place where Rama and Lakshmana were there."

Shlok 22- 23: The demons wielding harpoons, maces, discus, daggers, sticks, great arrows 
			spears, shining maces with spikes, picks lances, darts, massed weapons, clubs and circular 
			missiles, made use of them again and again in order to strike down the monkeys."

Shlok 24: "The impetuous Prahasta, with his steady hand, severed the head of Rama sleeping 
			there, with his mighty sword without a resistance from any one."

Shlok 25: "Fortunately, Vibhishana was over leaped and held captive. Lakshmana along 
			with the monkeys were made to run away in all directions."

Shlok 26: "O, Seetha! Sugreeva the king of monkeys with his neck broken and Hanuman 
			with his jaw removed were laid down and killed by the demons."

Shlok 27: "Thereafter Jambavan who was rising up on his knees was killed in the battle. 
			His body was cut off with many sharp-edged spears, like a tree is cut off."

Shlok 28- 29: "Mainda and Dvivida - those two great scourgers of their foes, the long bodied 
			and the foremost of the monkeys, groaning and breathless, their limbs bathed in blood-were 
			cut to pieces at the waist-level, by a sword."

Shlok 30-31: "Panasa, crying for help was stretched on the earth under a tree of the same 
			name. Pierced by lying in a pit. The exceedingly valiant kumuda on his part, shrieking, 
			was killed by a hail of missiles."

Shlok 32: "Angada, who was adorned with bracelets lies fallen down, emitting blood 
			on all sides, as he was pierced by the demons with many arrows, after approaching him."

Shlok 33: "The monkeys sleeping there were crushed by elephants and multitude of chariots, 
			like clouds are crushed to pieces by the velocity of wind."

Shlok 34: "The enemy fled in terror, pursued by demons, while being struck on the bak, 
			like lions pursuing great elephants."

Shlok 35: "Some monkeys fell in the sea and some sought shelter in the sky. The bears 
			with the monkeys climbed the trees."

Shlok 36: "By the demons with monstrous eyes, were killed a multitude of monkeys, at 
			the shores of the sea, in the mountains an in the woods."

Shlok 37: "Thus, your husband together with his army was killed by my troops. This 
			head, drenched in his blood and besmeared with dust has been gathered up."

Shlok 38: Thereafter, Ravana the Lord of demons who was very much difficult to be attacked, 
			spoke the following words to an ogress, while Seetha was overhearing them.

Shlok 39: "Bring Vidyujjihva, the demon of the cruel deed, by whom himself Raghava's 
			head was brought back from the battle-field."

Shlok 40: Holding that head along with a bow, Vidyujjihva making a respectful salute 
			with his head bent low, stood in front of Ravana.

Shlok 41: Thereafter, the king Ravana spoke the following words to Vidyujjihva, the 
			demon who had a large tongue and who was standing and moving closely.

Shlok 42: "Keep Rama's head immediately in front of Seetha. Let the miserable Seetha 
			see well the final condition of her husband.

Shlok 43: Hearing Ravana's words, that demon deposited the cherished head in the vicinity 
			of Seetha and soon disappeared from the site.

Shlok 44: "Here is Rama's bow famous in the three worlds!" - saying thus, Ravana threw 
			a great shining bow in front of Seetha.

Shlok 45: "This is the bow with its cord stretched, belonging to Rama, that was brought 
			back by Prahasta here, after killing that hero in the night."

Shlok 46: That Rama's head and bow on the ground in front of Seetha the illustrious 
			daughter of Janaka, saying: "You now become submissive to my desire."



SARGA 32
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha was shocked, fell unconscious at the sight of Rama's head and bow. She regained 
consciousness and asked Ravana to kill her also, so that she would join her husband in heaven. Meanwhile, 
Ravana is abruptly called away by an emissary and after consultation with his ministers, prepares his 
army for action against the forces of Rama.

Shlok 1- 2- 3: Seetha saw the illusory head and bow. She heard Ravana narrating about Rama's friendly 
relationship with Sugreeva, as earlier apprised by Hanuman. Recognizing that head as that of Rama, with 
a proof resembling her husband's eyes, facial complexion, hair, expanse of his forehead and the beautiful 
jewel worn on the top of his head, she was very much afflicted with sorrow, cried like an osprey and 
abused Kaikeyi who was the originator of the present calamity (as follows):

Shlok 4: Kaikeyi! Be a fulfiller of your craving! This Rama, causing a joy to the family, has 
been slain. The entire race has been destroyed by a woman of squabbling nature.

Shlok 5: "You gave clothes made of bark to the venerable Rama and sent him on exile to the forest 
along with me. What harm has he done to you?"

Shlok 6: Thus speaking, Seetha the miserable girl was trembling and fell on the ground like a 
plantain tree that was cut off. Thus speaking, Seetha the miserable girl was trembling and fell on the 
ground like a plantain tree that was cut off.

Shlok 7: The wide eyed Seetha thereafter was consoled in a moment, regained consciousness, approached 
near that illusory head and lamented as follows:

Shlok 8: "O, the long armed Rama! The pursuer of a strong will! Alas, you have been killed! I 
have become a witness to your last fate. I have been made a widow."

Shlok 9: "It is said that the early death of a husband is the misfortune of a wife. You, having 
good conduct, have preceded me in death."

Shlok 10: "Even you who were actually intent on protecting me, fallen in great affliction and immersed 
in an ocean of grief, have been killed by the enemies"

Shlok 11: "O, Rama! My mother- in-law Kausalya who cherished you tenderly has been left without 
a son and resembles a cow that has lost its calf."

Shlok 12: "O, Rama! It was mentioned even by astrologers that your life span is lengthy. O, Rama! 
Their words are wrong. You are short lived."

Shlok 13: "Otherwise, your prudence might have disappeared even though you were sagacious, for, 
Time the master of all beings has brought you to an end."

Shlok 14: "How is it possible that you, who knew the doctrine of political ethics obtained an unforeseen 
death? You, who knew the science of expediency, were indeed skilled in warding off calamities"

Shlok 15: "O, Rama, the lotus eyed! The night of destroying time which was very much cruel and 
terrible thus has encircled you, embezzled you and snatched you away from me."

Shlok 16: "O, the mighty armed! O, the best of men! Leaving the miserable me, you lied down here, 
embracing the earth as your beloved"

Shlok 17: "O, valiant Rama! Here is your bow which was decorated with gold, dear to me and worshipped 
diligently by you with sandal paste and wreath of flowers."

Shlok 18: "O, the faultless Rama! Surely, you must have met in heaven your father and my father-in- 
law Dasaratha as well as all the multitude of manes."

Shlok 19: "You have abandoned your own pious lineage of royal sages but whereas you performed a 
great act, which illuminated the heaven like a luminary."

Shlok 20: "O, prince! Why don't you look at me? Why don't you reply me, a wife who lived with you 
together since the time of obtaining me as a girl by you as a boy."

Shlok 21: "O, Rama! Remember your solemn promise at the time of our marriage, saying I shall have 
righteous conduct with you' Take me also with you, wretched as I Am."

Shlok 22: "O, Rama the best of beings! Why have you gone away, quitting me like this? Leaving me, 
the miserable woman, why have you gone to the other world from this world?"

Shlok 23: "That beautiful body, which was cuddled by me with divine essences, is now being dragged 
about by wild beasts."

Shlok 24: "Why are you not securing the privilege of being cremated with a sacrificial fire, even 
though you have worshipped the Lord through sacrificial performances such as Agnishtoma, duly furnished 
with abundant gifts?".

Shlok 25: "Kausalya absorbed as she was with grief can only see Lakshmana alone returned out of 
the three who attained exile."

Shlok 26: "He will narrate surely to her when enquired, about your slaughter as also the killing 
of the army of your alley, by demons at night."

Shlok 27: "O, Rama! Hearing that you were killed while sleeping and that I was kept in the house 
of ogres, she will be no more, as her heart will be broken."

Shlok 28: "The strong and faultless prince Rama was killed in a small puddle, after crossing the 
ocean, for the cause of me, an unworthy woman."

Shlok 29: "I, the obloquy of my race, was wedded by Rama due to ignorance. Thus, a wife herself 
has eventually proved to be the cause for death of Rama, an honorable man."

Shlok 30: "Even though I was a wife of Rama who showed hospitality to all the guests, it is I, 
that very person, who is weeping here and now, because without doubt, in a previous existence, an excellent 
gift was refused by me (to an eligible person)."

Shlok 31: "Unite the wife with the husband and without delay, arrange to kill me right at the head 
of Rama. Thus, you will perform an admirable and auspicious act."

Shlok 32: "O, Ravana! Join my head with his head and my body with his body. I shall go along the 
path of my magnanimous Lord."

Shlok 33: The wide-eyed Sita, seeing her husband's head and bow there again and again, was tormented 
with grief and lamented as aforesaid.

Shlok 34: While Seetha was lamenting thus, a demon who was a royal guard approached his Lord there 
with his joined palms in salutation (and cried as follows):

Shlok 35: "May you be victorious, O noble Lord!" he respectfully announced thus, thereby winning 
his pleasure and informed that Prahasta the army chief had come.

Shlok 36: "O, Lord! Prahasta has come with all ministers. He has sent me, eager as he is, to see 
you."

Shlok 37: "O, king, endowed with patience! There is a little urgent work by way of king's duty. 
Please accord them your audience now."

Shlok 38: Hearing the aforesaid communication of the demon, Ravana left the garden of Ashoka and 
bestowed audience to his ministers.

Shlok 39: He deliberated with his ministers as to what action in its entirety to be pursued and 
entered the council-chamber and issued his commands in accordance with the knowledge he possessed of 
Rama's forces.

Shlok 40: Soon after the departure of Ravana, the illusory head and bow had vanished.

Shlok 41: Then, Ravana the king of demons in consultation with his highly powerful ministers, decided 
on the measures he would adopt against Rama.

Shlok 42: Ravana the king of demons, resembling Yama the god of death, addressed all the generals 
standing nearby, devoted to his interests as follows:

Shlok 43: "By a sound of a drum beaten audibly with a drum stick, immediately summon all my forces. 
Do not tell them the reason for which I am calling."

Shlok 44: Then, the messengers answered, "So be it" obedient as they were to his words and instantly 
gathered a huge army together and informed their lord longing for fight, that they had since assembled 
the army.



SARGA 33
------------------------------

[Text] An ogre named Sarama reassures Seetha by telling her that Ravana, the conjurer
created an illusory appearance of Rama's head and exhibited it before her. She informs Seetha that
Rama is still alive and is stationed along with his forces at the southern shore of the ocean.
Sarama restores confidence to Seetha, by saying that Rama after killing Ravana in battle will soon
win her back.

Shlok 1: Seeing the bewildered Seetha, a demon named Sarama*, an affectionate female
companion then approached Seetha, her beloved Seetha, her beloved friend.

[Commentary] *Sarama, according to some commentators was the wife of Vibhishana.

Shlok 2: Sarama, the soft-spoken woman, consoled Seetha who having been infatuated by Ravana
was very much in distress.

Shlok 3: Sarma, who was assigned by Ravana to guard Seetha, was kind hearted and firm in
austerity. She was indeed made a companion by Seetha, who was being protected by her there.

Shlok 4: The affectionate Sarama found Seetha stupefied and just risen after rolling in the
dust and soiled, resembling a female horse.

Shlok 5: Sarama consoled the very virtuous Seetha as follows "O, Seetha! Be comfortable! Do
not get perturbed in your mind.

Shlok 6- 7: timid woman! Because of my friendship with you, I overheard Ravana's words and all
the words you have spoken in reply to him, by hiding nearby in a barren sky without fear. O, large
eyed woman! I do not have any fear of Ravana, owing to my affection towards you".

Shlok 8: "O, Seetha! Every thing was ascertained by me on the spot, after going out, about
the reason for which Ravana has gone away agitated."

Shlok 9: "It is not possible to attack Rama, a man of self awareness, while he is asleep. Nay
even killing him, the tiger among men, is well nigh impossible."

Shlok 10: "It is not possible to kill in this manner even monkeys, who perform fighting with
trees, in as much as they are fully protected by Rama, even as celestials are protected by Indra
their lord"

Shlok 11- 12- 13: "O, Seetha! Rama, who is endowed with long and well rounded arms, an illustrious
man, who is large-chested, a man of great energy, an archer well known in the world, a man endowed
with muscularity, a righteous minded man, a person of celebrity on earth, a man of eternal
strength, a protector for himself and for others, while together with his brother Lakshmana, a man
of high descent, a knower of doctrines of conduct and behavior, the killer of a stream of enemy
forces, a man of inconceivable strength and valor, a venerable man and an annihilator of
adversaries, has not been killed."

Shlok 14: "A trickery has been hurled on you here by the cruel Ravana, a conjurer, who is
perverse in thinking and action and an enemy of all beings."

Shlok 15: "Your sorrow is (now) gone once for all. An all-pervading auspiciousness will await
you. Accordingly prosperity will attend on you. Hear me."

Shlok 16: "Rama, along with his army of monkeys, having crossed the ocean, reached its
southern shore and is encamped there."

Shlok 17: "Rama, who was along with fully meaningful Lakshmana, was perceived by me. He stands
protected by the troops gathered together at the vicinity of the ocean."

Shlok 18: "Some swift paced demons, who were dispatched by Ravana, brought this very news here
that Rama has crossed the ocean."

Shlok 19: "O, the wide-eyed Seetha! Hearing that news, yonder Ravana is busy making
deliberations with all his ministers."

Shlok 20: While Sarama, the ogre was talking as aforesaid with Seetha; a terrific sound was
heard, from the troops engaged in the impending war.

Shlok 21: Hearing the crashing sound of kettle drums, made to sound like a thunder storm with
a drum stick, Sarama in her sweet voice spoke to Seetha as follows:

Shlok 22: "O, timid Seetha! This frightful sound of a kettledrum is indeed indicative of
preparation for a war. Hear also the thundering crash of the kettle drums, which resembles the
rumbling of clouds"

Shlok 23: "Elephants in rut are being caparisoned for war. Chariot horses are being prepared
for a battle. Thousands of horsemen carrying darts in their hands are seen."

Shlok 24: "Thousands of soldiers equipped with armor are marching quickly hither and thither.
Royal highways are filled with wonderfully looking warriors like a swift flowing sea with its flood
of waters making a roaring sound."

Shlok 25- 26- 27: "See hurriedly, this sheen of polished weapons, shields and coats of mail sending
forth luster of many hues like the splendor of fire consuming a forest in summer. Here is seen the
flurry of chariots, horses and elephants following the lead of Ravana as well as of energetic
demons thrilled with joy."

Shlok 28- 29: "Hear the sound of bells of elephants. Hear the ratting of chariots. Hear the cry of
neighing horses, resembling the flourish of trumpets. Here is the bustle of demons, carrying
uplifted weapons in their hands; following the lead of Ravana. This bustling activity is causing
hair to stand erect through terror."

Shlok 30- 31: "A good fortune, which will bring your sorrow to an end, awaits you. A peril has
arrived for demons. The lotus eyed Rama, your husband, who has overcome his anger but having an
unimaginable strength will kill Ravana in battle and win you back"

Shlok 32: "Your consort along with Lakshmana will show his valor against the demons, like
Indra the lord of celestials along with Vishnu the lord of preservation, the annihilator of enemies
exhibited his strength over his adversaries."

Shlok 33: "Very soon, I shall see you, mounted on the lap of Rama who actually arrived, your
object of his coming being fulfilled and the enemy fallen."

Shlok 34: "O, Seetha! You will shed tears of joy on the bosom of that broad-chested Rama, re-
united with you and holding you clasped to his breast."

Shlok 35: "Before long, O divine Seetha, that mighty Rama will loosen the one single plait
which has reached past your hips, which you have worn these many months."

Shlok 36: "O, Queen! Seeing his face, looking like a rising moon, you will renounce your tears
born of grief, like a female snake casts off its slough."

Shlok 37: "O, Seetha! Having killed Ravana in combat within no time, Rama (who deserves
facility); will enjoy happiness in the company of the beloved, namely yourself."

Shlok 38: Acclaimed by the high soled Rama, you will be so happy as how the earth, endowed
with crops, feels after the onset of good rains."

Shlok 39: "O, queen! Seek refuge now with him - the sun that rolls towards Meru the highest
mountain, like a horse that makes its round rapidly. That sun is indeed the source of all
creatures."



SARGA 34
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha asks Sarama to go secretly to Ravana and get to know what he is doing as well
as report to her back about Ravana's decision about the matter of releasing her or continuing to
keep her captive. Sarama secretly hears the conversation of Ravana with his ministers and reports
to Seetha that Ravana is not inclined to set her free. Sarama consoles Seetha, saying that Rama
with his sharp arrows will kill Ravana and take her back to Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: Seetha, who was overwhelmed with anguish on hearing Ravana's words, was comforted
and rendered happy by Sarama, as parched earth is solaced by rain.

Shlok 2: Desiring to be of further service to her friend Seetha, the affectionate Sarama,
skilled in the knowledge of time, smiling while talking, spoke the following words at that
appropriate time.

Shlok 3: "O, black eyed lady! I am capable of carrying a message of your words and good will
to Rama and to return secretly."

Shlok 4: "When I am journeying in the sky self -supported, neither the god of wind nor Garuda
the eagle can follow my movement."

Shlok 5: To Sarama, who was speaking as aforesaid, Seetha her voice no longer charged with
grief, gently and sweetly replied in the following words:

Shlok 6: "You are capable of going to heaven or to the penultimate subterranean region. Know
from me today the duty that has got to be performed by you for my sake."

Shlok 7: "If your intention is to act kindly towards me and your resolve is firm , I wish you
to go and know what Ravana is doing now."

Shlok 8: "That cruel and evil minded Ravana, equipped with strength in the shape of conjuring
tricks, who makes his enemies cry has bemused me, as spirituous liquor bemuses one, the moment it
is imbibed."

Shlok 9: "He causes me to be threatened by words all the time by the most frightful ogresses,
who always surround me and insult me by their act repeatedly."

Shlok 10: "I am depressed in mind and distrustful. My mind is not in its natural state.
Staying in Ashoka grove, I am distressed because of his fear."

Shlok 11: "Report to me, all that is decided by him during his talk going on with his
ministers about the matter of releasing me or keeping me captive. It will be of great service to
me."

Shlok 12: The soft spoken Sarama, wiping her face, which got moist with tears, replied as
follows to Seetha who was speaking as aforesaid:

Shlok 13: "If your opinion is like this, I shall go on that account, O, Seetha! Having grasped
the feeling of the enemies, I shall return O, Seetha!"

Shlok 14: Speaking thus, Surama thereafter went to the vicinity of that demon and heard the
conversation of Ravana who was with his ministers.

Shlok 15: Sarama, who knew how to investigate could hear the wicked Ravana's resolve and soon
returned to Ashoka grove.

Shlok 16: Sarama, who entered the Ashoka grove, saw Seetha who looked like Lakshmi the goddess
of prosperity (and the wife of Vishnu); bereft of the lotus and waiting for her only.

Shlok 17: Seetha affectionately embraced the kindly speaking Surama who returned there and
offered personally a seat to her.

Shlok 18: "Sitting here comfortably, tell me about the real design of that cruel and wicked
Ravana"

Shlok 19: When Seetha trembling with fear enquired thus, Sarama narrated all the conversation
of Ravana together with his ministers.

Shlok 20: "Excellent words were spoken by Kaikasi, the mother of Ravana as well as Aviddha the
aged minister asking for your release, O Seetha!"

Shlok 21: "Let Seetha, be restored honorably to Rama the Lord of men. That wonderful** thing
happened in Janasthana is an enough eye- opener to you."

[Commentary] ** Rama exterminated fourteen thousand demons led by such great warriors as
Khara and Dushana at Janastana.

Shlok 22: "Which mortal would accomplish the crossing of the ocean, the discovery of Seetha by
Hanuman, and the carnage of the demons in combat on this earth?"

Shlok 23: "Though admonished in many ways by the aged ministers and his mother he is not
inclined to set you free, any more than a miser would leave his hold on his riches.

Shlok 24: "O, Seetha! He does not want to release you, without dying himself in a battle. This
is the resolve of the cruel Ravana along with his ministers."

Shlok 25: -"Thereafter, due to infatuation caused by his impending death, his aforesaid
determination is very firm .He is not in a position to release you, not through sheer fear, but
until he is actually defeated in battle through the carnage of all the demons and of himself."

Shlok 26: "O, dark eyed Seetha! Killing Ravana by his sharp arrows in combat, Rama will take
you back to Ayodhya by all means."

Shlok 27: In the meantime was heard the sound of all the monkey troops blended with the sound
of kettle drums, causing earth to shake.

Shlok 28: Hearing that sound of that monkey troops, the servants of Ravana stationed in Lanka
were lack- luster with their movements, overcome by depression. They did not see anything salutary
in it, owing to the fault of their king.



SARGA 35
------------------------------

[Text] With the sound of kettle drums and couches, Rama arrives to Lanka with his army.
Ravana hears those sounds and calls his ministers to chalk out his further course of action.
Malyavan, Ravana's maternal grandfather advises Ravana to conclude peace with Rama and restore
Seetha to him as he is perceiving adverse omens.

Shlok 1: The mighty armed Rama, the conqueror of hostile cities sallied forth with the
resonant roll of kettle drums, mingled with the blast of couches.

Shlok 2: Hearing that sound, Ravana the Lord of demons, paused for a moment to reflect and
looked towards his ministers.

Shlok 3: Ravana of great strength the tormentor of the world, and a cruel lord of demons then
addressed all his ministers in a voice that resounded the entire hall as follows, accusing
none.

Shlok 4: "I have heard what you told me about Rama's crossing the ocean, his prowess,
strength and heroism."

Shlok 5: "I know that you are truly brave in the battle-field, yet, on beholding that valiant
Rama, you too look on each other in silence."

Shlok 6: Hearing those word of Ravana whose maternal grandfather he was, the highly
intelligent demon called Malyavan, answered him thus:

Shlok 7: "O, king! He who is well-versed in (fourteen)* sciences and follows the path of
prudence, enjoys sovereignty for a long time and compels his enemies too into subjugation."

[Commentary] Four Vedas, six Vedaangas, the Puranas, the Mimamsa, Nyaya and Dharma together
constitute fourteen sciences.

Shlok 8: "He who concludes peace even with enemies or wages war at a fitting time strengthens
his own party and attains a great power."

Shlok 9: "A treaty of peace should be reached by a king who is weaker or equal to an enemy.
The king should never underrate that enemy. If the king is more powerful, he should make war on the
enemy."

Shlok 10: "O, Ravana! For that reason, alliance with Rama finds favour with me. Let Seetha,
for whose sake you are being attacked, be restored to him."

Shlok 11: "All the celestials, sages and Gandharvas the celestial musicians are wishing for
victory of Rama. Do not get an enmity with them. Let alliance with him be acceptable to you."

Shlok 12: "Brahma, the lord of creation, created only two classes of beings, the celestials
and the demons. Celestials take refuge in righteousness and demons in unrighteousness."

Shlok 13: "O, Ravana! Righteous is said to be on the side of the high-souled celestials.
Unrighteousness is indeed on the side of ogres and demons."

Shlok 14: "When righteousness swallows unrighteousness, it becomes kR^ita Yuga, a golden age.
When unrighteousness swallows righteousness, it incites Kali Yuga the fourth age."

Shlok 15: "Therefore, while you were wandering in the worlds, even the great righteousness was
destroyed and unrighteousness favoured by you. So, the enemies are stronger than us."

Shlok 16: "Due to your negligence, that well nourished unrighteousness is swallowing us. Being
favourable to demons, the sect of demons is thereby getting augmented."

Shlok 17: "You, who are interested in sensual enjoyments, doing whatever you like, have
created a great alarm in the sages, having the nature of fire."

Shlok 18- 19- 20: "The power of those sages is insurmountable like an igniting fire. Having purified
their minds through penance, they are intent on promotion of righteousness, in as much as these
Brahamans worship the gods through different principal sacrifices, also pour oblations into the
sacred fires with due ceremony and read the Vedas (Sacred texts) in a loud voice. Having subdued
the demons, they continued to chant the sacred text, on hearing which all the demons scattered in
all directions, as thundering clouds in a hot season."

Shlok 21: "The smoke coming forth from the sacred fire of the sage who resemble the fire (in
brilliance), enveloping the ten directions, takes away the magical power of the demons."

Shlok 22: "The severe austerity practised by the sages, firm of resolve, in different
countries torment the demons."

Shlok 23- 24: "You received a boon of invincibility from celestials, demons and semi-divine
beings, but then are men, bears as well as powerful and very efficacious having strong prowess who
are coming hither, roaring like lions."

Shlok 25: "By seeing various kinds of unexpected events (portents) and many types of terrific
things, I am perceiving a destruction of all the demons."

Shlok 26: "With terrifying clamour, monstrous clouds, inspiring horror, rain hot blood on
Lanka on every side."

Shlok 27: "Drops of tears drop from the weeping elephants, horses etc., whose skins became
discoloured, covered with dust and are not shining as before."

Shlok 28: "Flesh-eating animals, jackals and eagles and howling horribly. Entering Lanka, they
are in the groves, forming into groups."

Shlok 29: "Black women, chattering incoherently in dreams and robbing different houses stand
in front, laughing loudly with their white teeth."

Shlok 30: "Dogs devour the sacred offerings offered in homes. Donkeys are born of cows and
rats of mongoose."

Shlok 31: "Cats mate with tigers, pigs with dogs, Kinnaras (a species of demi-gods with the
human figure and the head of a horse or with a horse's body and the head of a man) with demons and
men."

Shlok 32: "Red-footed and white pigeons, messengers of death, move in different directions,
foretelling the extermination of demons."

Shlok 33: "Domesticated minas (a kind of birds) making a chirping sound, defeated by other
bellicose birds drop down, being twined together in groups."

Shlok 34- 35: "Birds and wild animals, facing towards the sun, cry out. Death, in the form of a
frightful, monstrous and cruel blackish fellow with a shaven head casts his eyes on all our
dwellings, both morning and evening. These and such other sinister omens appear."

Shlok 36- 37: "I deem Rama of firm fortitude as Vishnu dwelling in human form. This Rama is not a
mere human being, he by whom that most wonderful bridge was built across the sea. O, Ravana!
Conclude peace with Rama, who is the king of men. Having come to know of his acts, let that which
is good for the future be done after a mature understanding."



Having spoken thus, the mighty Malyavan, who was foremost in valour among the
bravest warriors, being aware of what was passing in Ravana's mind, eyeing him, became silent.



SARGA 36
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana turns his deaf ear to the words of Malyavan and even abuses him that the latter 
exaggerating the strength of Rama. Ravana further says that he will not restore Seetha to Rama and that 
Rama and his army will not go back alive, having crossed the ocean and reached Lanka. Then, Ravana assigns 
Prahasta and others to guard the four main gates of Lanka against the inroads of the enemy. He retires 
to his inner apartments, after ordering these assignments.

Shlok 1: The evil- minded Ravana the ten-faced monster, who had fallen under the sway of Death; 
could not brook that beneficial advice tendered by Malyavan.

Shlok 2: He had fallen under the sway of anger, knitting his brows on the face as he was, rolling 
his eyes in fury and spoke to Malyavan (as follows)

Shlok 3: "I have closed my ears to the speech you have made, albeit with good intentions and even 
by taking sides with the enemy."

Shlok 4: "How can you hold Rama, who is a mere human being, a small feeble man, taking help from 
monkeys and dwelling in a forest having been abandoned by his father, to be a competent person?"

Shlok 5: "How can you hold me, the Lord of demons, terrifying celestials and possessing all powers 
in full, to be a weaker person?"

Shlok 6: "I suspect that you spoke these harsh words to me because of your envy of my prowess 
or your partiality towards the enemies or my lenience towards you."

Shlok 7: "Which learned man, understand the truth in the scriptures, would speak thus harshly 
to a mighty person in power, were it not to instigate him?"

Shlok 8: "Why should I give back Seetha, who is like Lakshmi the goddess of fortune without the 
lotus, having brought her away from the forest, through fear of Rama?"

Shlok 9: "See Rama killed within a few days by me, along with Lakshama together with Sugreeva 
in the midst of crores of monkeys."

Shlok 10: "How should this Ravana, whom in combat, the celestials themselves dare not meet in a 
duel, entertain fear in this encounter?"

Shlok 11: "Rather would I be cut into two pieces than bend before anybody! Such was I from birth, 
it is my nature by difacult and unalterable."

Shlok 12: "What great marvel is there in that which gave way to terror if by happy chance, a bridge 
indeed was constructed by Rama across the ocean."

Shlok 13: "That Rama along with his army of monkeys, having crossed the ocean, will not go back 
alive. It is my true promise to you."

Shlok 14: Beholding Ravana to be highly excited and speaking with such fury, Malyavan, abashed, 
did not reply.

Shlok 15: Invoking blessings of victory to the king as courtesy demanded Malyavan took permission 
and went home.

Shlok 16: Ravana the demon on his part, assisted by his ministers having deliberated on the things 
to be examined, set about planning the defense of Lanka.

Shlok 17- 18: Thereafter, he assigned the eastern gate to the demon, Prahasta and the southern gate 
to Maha Parshva and Mhodara both of great prowess. At the western gate, he placed his son Indrajit, 
a powerful conjuror, with considerable force of demons.

Shlok 19: Placing Shuka and Sarana at the northern city-gate, Ravana told his ministers that he 
would go there personally.

Shlok 20: He place the demon Virupaksha, who was full of energy and courage, to be in the center 
of the fort, with a large number of demons.

Shlok 21: Making an arrangement in Lanka in this manner, that bull among demons, under the sway 
of Time, deemed his purpose as accomplished.

Shlok 22: Having ordered for adequate arrangements for the defence of the city, Ravana then let 
his ministers depart. Having been honoured with blessings of victory by the body of counsellors, he 
entered his mighty and sumptuous inner apartments.



SARGA 37
------------------------------

[Text] Rama, Sugreeva, Hanuman and others assemble to take counsel together, upon reaching
the precinets of Lanks. While they were delibrating on the ways and means for the success of their
mission, Vibhishana informs that he has sent his counsellors as spies to gather information about
the enemy's plans and that they returned after gathering the required news about Ravana's
arrangements at the four gates of theity. After hearing Vibhishana's information, Rama orders Nila,
Angada Hanuman and others to storm the four gates and decides to stay on Suvela mountain with his
army.

Shlok 1- 2- 3: Meanwhile, Rama the king of men and Sugreeva the Sovereign of monkeys, Hanuman the
son of the wind, Jambavan the king of the Bears, Vibhishana the demon, Angada the son of Vali,
Lakshmana, Sushena along with his kinsfolk, Mainda, Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Kumuda, Nala and
Panasa, all having reached the enemy's territory, assembled to take counsel together.

Shlok 4: "Observe this city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana, impregnable both to celestials and the
demons together, or the uragas (the serpent-demons) and Gandharvas (celestial musicians)."

Shlok 5: "Ravana, the lord of demons always stays in the City. Think of the ways and means
for the success of our expedition."

Shlok 6: While they were talking thus, Vibhishana the younger brother of Ravana spoke the
following meaningful and polished words:

Shlok 7: "My counsellors named Anala, Panasa, Sampati and Pramati went to the City of Lanka
and returned here."

Shlok 8: "Assuming the form of birds, all the four entered that enemy's citadel and observed
the measures taken by Ravana closely."

Shlok 9: "O, Rama! I give a detailed report as it was given to me of the defence-arrangements
made by tha evil-minded Ravana, hear me."

Shlok 10: "The very strong Prashata is standing near the eastern gate. Mahaparshva and
Mahodara of mighty prowess are at the southern gate."

Shlok 11: "Indragit, the son of Ravana is at the western gate along with many demons armed
with harpoons, swords, bows, spears and hammers together with warriors furnished with weapons of
various kinds."

Shlok 12- 13: "A prey to great anxiety, Ravana knower of magical formulas, is himself stationed at
the northern gate, along with several thousands of demons holding lances in their hand."

Shlok 14: "As for Virupaksha he with mighty army carrying spears, clubs and bows along with
other demons, occupies the center of the fort."

Shlok 15: "All these counsellors of mine watched those groups of troops arranged in Lanka in
this manner and immediately returned here."

Shlok 16- 17: "The elephants and chariots number some ten thousand each, the cavalry twenty
thousand and there are more than a crore foot soldiers. These strong and intrepid demons
endeavouring to kill someone in battle have ever been their sovereign's favourites."

Shlok 18: "O, Rama! In these demons, a retinue of ten lacs each is near at hand for each
demon."

Shlok 19: The mighty armed Vibhishana showed those counsellors to Rama after reporting the
aforesaid news pertaining to Lanka, thus informed by his counsellors.

Shlok 20: The counsellors of Vibhishana themselves confirmed all that was known regarding
Lanka. Thereafter, the illustrious Vibhishana, in his desire to please Rama, addressed that
lotus-eyed one, further with the following words:

Shlok 21- 22: "O, Rama! When Ravana attacked Kubera in battle, sixty lacs of demons sallied forth
with him. All of them were akin to the evil-minded Ravana in prowess, in strength, in courage and
in pride."

Shlok 23: "Indignation need not be resorted to (by you) based on this report. I am not
terrifying you, bt only arousing your wrath. You are indeed capable of overpowering even celestials
by your valour."

Shlok 24: "Having set out these monkey-forces in battle-array, you shall destryoy Ravana with
this great army of monkeys, composed of four divisions, which surround you."

Shlok 25: Vibhishana having spoken thus Rama gave the following orders for the attack of the
adversaries.

Shlok 26: "At the eastern gate of Lanka, Nila that lion among monkeys for his part, surrounded
by many monkeys, should attack Prahasta."

Shlok 27: "At the southern gate, Angada the son of Vali, surrounded by his mighty army, should
oppose Mahaparshva and Mahodara."

Shlok 28: "Let Hanuman that son of the Wind and of inscrutable spirit, surrounded by a
multitude of monkeys, enter the City through the western gate."

Shlok 29- 30: I am myself determined to slay that wicked who owing to the boon he has received,
enjoys oppressing multitudes of Daityas (gaints) and Daanavas (demons), as also the magnanimous
sages and who ranges the world, persenting all being. With the aid of Lakshmana, I shall forcibly
enter the northern gate where Ravana is stationed along with his army."

Shlok 32: "Let the mighty Sugreeva the king of monkeys, the valiant Jambavan the king of bears
and Vibhishana, the younger brother of the Lord of demons occupy the central position of the
army."

Shlok 33: "Monkeys should not assume human form in the battle, for, in the army of monkeys,
this monkey-shape should serve as a sign of recognition among us."

Shlok 34- 35: "Among our own people also, the form of monkeys will become a sign of recognition
for us. Seven of us will attack the foe in our human form, I, my brother Lakshmana, who is full of
valour, my friend Vibhishana and his four companions."

Shlok 36- 37: Having said thus to Vibhishana for the success of the enterprise, Rama in the role
of a wise leader, decided to stay on Mount Suvela, after observing its charming slopes.

Shlok 38: Thereafter, having covered the entire filed with his great army and having made up
his mind to destroy the enemies, that high-souled Rama of great courage, set out for Lanka with a
joyous and exultant air.



SARGA 38
------------------------------

[Text] Rama expresses his desire to Vibhishana and Sugreeva to halt on Suvela mountain for that 
night, and to envision the City of Lanka. Rama along with Lakshmana, Vibhishana, Sugreeva and his army 
ascend the mountain and witness the beauty of Lanka. They halt on that mountain-resort for the night.

Shlok 1- 2: Rama, who was followed by Lakshmana, having made up his mind to ascend Mount Suvela, 
spoke in a gentle and prime voice to Sugreeva and to Vibhishana who was the knower of what is right, 
a demon devoted to him who was experienced in counsel and a knower of prescribed rules (as follows):

Shlok 3: "We shall ascend up on high this Suvela mountain, shining well with hundreds of minerals. 
All of us will stay on this mountain for this night."

Shlok 4- 5: "We shall see Lanka the abode of that demon, Ravana the evil-minded by whom my wife was 
taken away for the sake of his own death, by whom virtue was not understood, good character was not 
known and noble lineage was not seen and by whom that contemptible act was done with an inferior demoniacal 
mind."

Shlok 6: "My anger is increased on hearing the name of that demon. Because of the offence committed 
by him, I shall see that all these demons are destroyed."

Shlok 7: "Falling into that power of trap of death, one does an evil act. Because of the offence 
committed by him the vilest, his lineage is destroyed."

Shlok 8: Rama, thus thinking of Ravana in anger, approached and ascended the mountain of Suvela 
with its conspicuous summits.

Shlok 9: Lakshamana too who took delight in his own valour and steadfastness, keeping ready his 
mighty bow with arrows, followed behind Rama Sugreeva along with his ministers and Vibhishana ascended 
the mountain, by following him.

Shlok 10- 11- 12- 13: Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Mainda, Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, 
Panasa, Kumuda, Hara, Rambha the chief of the troop, Jambavan, sushena, the greatly wise Rishabha, Durmukha 
of great splendour, Shatabali the monkey and other hundreds of monkeys which are fast-moving, which 
can wander easily on mountains with a speed akin to that of wind, ascended that Suvela mountain which 
Rama ascended.

Shlok 14: Having ascended the mountain from all sides within no long time, they saw at its apex, 
the city of Lanka which appeared as though it was hanging in the sky.

Shlok 15: The chiefs of monkey-troops saw that beautiful City of Lanka, furnished with excellent 
gates, enriched with exquisitc ramparts and pervaded all over with demons.

Shlok 16: Those excellent monkeys saw another rampart formed out of the black demons so standing 
together scribble on that existing exquisite rampart.

Shlok 17: Seeing the demons who were craving for war, all those monkeys made various types of noises, 
while Rama was witnessing the scene.

Shlok 18: Then, the sun reddened with evening-twillight went down and the night shining with full 
moon arrived.

Shlok 19: Thereafter, Rama along with Lakshmana as well as Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys together 
with troops and captions of troops, duly greeted welcomingly and treated hospitably by Vibhishana, halted 
happily on the mountain resort of Suvela.



SARGA 39
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and the monkeys see the charming gardens and groves located in Lanka, viewing
them from the top of Suvela mountain. Some of the monkeys, thrilling with rapture, enter the
gardens and enjoy their beauty of flowers and birds. Some others went towards Lanka; located on the
apex of Trikuta mountain. They see the city with its large mansions and seven storied buildings,
including the thousand-pillared mansion of Ravana with a height almost touching the skies.

Shlok 1: The valiant army-chiefs of monkeys stayed on Suvela mountain for that night and saw
the garden and groves in Lanka.

Shlok 2: Seeing those gardens which were levelled, beautiful, spacious, majestic and
enchanting to look at, they became astonished.

Shlok 3- 4- 5- 6: Thick with Champaka, Ashoka, Vakula Sala and palmyra trees, covered with groves of
Tamala and Panasa trees, surrounded with rows of Nagakesara trees, Lanka looked splended on all
sides like the city of Amaravati reigned by Indra the god of celestials, with green lawns and
variegated avenues and with beautiful trees of various kinds like Hintala, Arjuna, Nipa Saptaparna
in full flowering, Tilaka, Karnikara and Patal whose crests were laden with flowers and which were
intertwined with climbers laden with multi-coloured flowers and red tender leaves.

Shlok 7: The trees there were laden with fragrant and greatly enchanting flowers and fruits,
as human beings were laden with ornaments.

Shlok 8: That garden, which bore flowers and fruits in relation to all seasons and with full
of bees, like chaitraratha (garden of Kubera, the god of riches), was quite charming, like Nandana
(garden of Indra the Lord of celestials)

Shlok 9: In that garden abounding in cascades, the songs of birds like gallinules,
lapwings(small white cranes), dancing peacocks and cuckoos were heard.

Shlok 10-11- 12: Then, those monkeys, thrilling with rapture, delighted, brave and assuming any shape
at will, entered the aforesaid groves and gardens, with birds ever excited with joy, wandered by
bees, with clusters of trees occupied by cuckoos, having variegated sounds of birds and song of the
large bees, abounding with sounds of ospreys, with the music of wagtails and cries of canes.

Shlok 13: While those mighty and splendid monkeys were entering the groves a breeze with
flowery fragrance, delightful to the nose, blew.

Shlok 14: Some other troop-leaders of the valiant monkeys came out of their troops with due
permission from sugreeva and went towards Lanka, the city adorned with flags

Shlok 15: Those monkeys, great in making noises causing the birds to frighten and displeasing
to the animals and elephants, went, causing that Lanka to tremble, by their noises.

Shlok 16: Those monkeys with great speed marched ahead, making the earth flattened by their
feet and the dust thus raised by their feet went up instant aneously.

Shlok 17: Frightened by that sound, bears lions buffaloes elephants, deers and birds were
trembled and terrified and hastened towards ten different directions.

Shlok 18-19: The solitary peak of Trikuta mountain, which is so high as if touching the sky, all
over covered with flowers entirely, resembling gold; to an extent of eight hundred miles; bright;
charming to look at, beautiful, glorious, majestic, inaccessible even by birds, hard to be ascended
by people may, even by the mind-how much more by an act of walking?

Shlok 20: Lanka, ruled by Ravana, with a breadth of eighty mile and a length of one hundred
sixty miles, was located on the apex of the mountain there.

[Commentary] The length and breadth of the city given here varies from that given elsewhere -
which is a hundred Yojanas wide and thirty yojanas long. This anomaly is reconciled by commentators
by explaining the present verse as referring to the length and breadth of Lanka proper, which
comprised the residence of Ravana.

Shlok 21: The city of Lanka looked beautiful with its towering City-gates resembling white
clouds as well as with golden and silver ramparts.

Shlok 22: The city of Lanka, greatly adorned by palaces and seven storied mansions, looked
like the sky with clouds at the end of a summer and as a region of Vishnu (the god of preservation)
between earth and heaven.

Shlok 23- 24: A palace, duly graced with a thousand pillars, which looked like a peak of Mount
Kailasa was three in the City of Lanka, which was always the City of Lanka, which was always
protected by a complete army of demons. The palace seemed to be scraping the skies and was to be
seen as an ornament to the City of Ravana.

Shlok 25- 26- 27: The glorious Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana along with monkeys saw that
charming golden city of Ravana, graced with mountains picturesque with various minerals, splendid
with gardens reechoing with songs of birds of every kind, frequented by varieties of deer, richly
endowed with various kinds of flowers, inhabited by demons of every degree and duly flourishing,
having increased its wealth.

Shlok 28: Beholding that City, which looks like heaven and crammed with huge palaces, the
valiant Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana was seized with astonishment.

Shlok 29: Rama with his great army saw that City, full of precious gems, having all kinds of
facilities, adorned with rows of mansions, having excellent doors with huge mechanical appliances
and with a large armed forces protecting the City.



SARGA 40
------------------------------

[Text] Rama together with Sugreeva and others mount to the top of Suvela mountain and see
the city of Lanka. There, above a gate-way of the City, stands Ravana. Seeing Ravana, Sugreeva
springs to the top of the gate where Ravana is bounces on him, pulls his thrown and throws it away
on the ground. thereafter, Ravana and Sugreeva carry on duel for a long time without any fatigue.
They wrestle endlessly in different postures. Finally, after reducing Ravana to exhaustion,
Sugreeva comes back and rejoins his monkey-troops.

Shlok 1: Then, Rama along with Sugreeva, together with the troop leaders of monkeys, ascended
the top of Suvela mountain which was having a circumference of sixteen miles.

Shlok 2: Halting there just for a while and surveying the ten cardinal points, Rama saw the
city of Lanka, which was beautifully constructed by Visvakarma, the divine architect on the top of
Trikuta Mountain with nice arrangements and ravishing with enchanting groves.

Shlok 3- 4- 5- 6: There above a gateway, stood the invincible Ravana the lord of demons, who was being
fanned with white whisks on both sides, was graced with a triumphal parasol, was smeared with red
sandal paste, adorned with scarlet ornaments, attired in raiment embroidered in gold, resembling a
dark cloud, who bore on his breast scars of wounds inflicted on him by Airavata (the elephant who
carries Indra the Lord of celestials, on his back) with his tusks, wrapped in a cloak of red colour
resembling the colour of hare's blood and looked like a mass of clouds in the sky enveloped with
sunshine at sunset.

Shlok 7: On seeing Ravana, Sugreeva got up all at once, while Rama and the chiefs of the army
of monkeys were looking on.

Shlok 8: Gathering up his strength and courage, Sugreeva, in an impulse of fury, bounded from
the summit of the mountain and then sprang to the top of the gate (where Ravana was).

Shlok 9: For a moment, he paused and then with a fearless soul, he saw that demon, whom he
regarded as a mere straw and thereafter spoke the following words harshly:

Shlok 10: "O, demon! I am a friend and a servant of Rama, the Lord of the world. You will not
be spared by me today, by the inspiring grace of Rama."

Shlok 11: Thus speaking, Sugreeva jumped up all at once, bounced over on ravana, pulled his
brightly coloured crown from his head and threw it away on the ground.

Shlok 12: Seeing Sugreeva about to rush upon him again, Ravana spoke as follows: "You were
Sugreeva (one who has a handsome neck), when your were not present before my eyes. But now, you
will now become Hinagriva bereft of your neck."

Shlok 13: Speaking thus, Ravana raised up and quickly flung Sugreeva to the ground with both
his arms. Bouncing like a ball, Sugreeva flung back his adversary with his arms.

Shlok 14- 15: Ravana and Sugreeva of great strength carried on a duel which was unbearable, with
perspiration broke out on their limbs, with their bodies red with blood, each clung to other other
paralyzing his opponent's movements resembling silk-cotton and Kimshuka trees, followed by blows of
fists, slaps of hands blows of elbows and blows of fingers on each other.

Shlok 16: Having wrestled for a long time in the center of the flat floor of the gate way,
each in turn repeatedly lifting their bodies and bending their feet in a particular way, the two
highly swift combatants remained in that flat roof of the gate way.

Shlok 17: Crushing one another and their bodies clung together, they both dropped down between
the defensive walls and the moat. They would leap up again, seizing each other from the ground,
after pausing an instant to regain their breath.

Shlok 18: With arms interlaced like with ropes joined together, they remained locked together
in the struggle. Both of them, who had received training in wrestling and fully endowed with night,
were now moving to and fro in the arena.

Shlok 19: The two heroes, who resembled a tiger and a a lion having their tusks growing or two
young lordly elephants encountening in a hostile manner, with arms interlaced and having duly tried
their strength, fell on the ground together.

Shlok 20: Thereafter rising, those two heroes hurled themselves on each other, circling around
the arena again and again, like skilled and mighty wrestlers, nor were they easily fatigued.

Shlok 21: Like unto great tuskers with their enormous arms resembling the trunks, those two
warriors were keeping back each other, fought vehemently for a long time and moved speedily in a
circular arena.

Shlok 22: Approaching each other like tow wild cats fighting over a piece of meat trying to
kill each other, they stood growling again and again.

Shlok 23- 24- 25- 26: The two warriors, Sugreeva and Ravana, who were skilled in wrestling, excuted
innumerable and myraid evolutions, taking up diverse postures, moving in a curved line like an ox's
urine, coming and going, stepping side ways, having a retrograde motion to avoid blows, turning
about abandoning the attack, dashing towards each other, leaping, standing firm and erect,
retreated, turned sideways, rushed in a bent posture, ran lifting their foot to kick the opponent
and by letting go or stealing away.

Shlok 27- 28: Meanwhile, Ravana decided to common using his magic power. Knowing it, Sugreeva flew
into the sky triumphantly shaking off all fatigue, while Ravana, baffled by Sugreeva stood
confounded there alone.

Shlok 29: Thus, the Lord of the monkeys, acquiring fame as a warrior, reducing Ravana to
exhaustion, ascended into the infinite sky and the offspring of the Sun then went to the side of
Rama, who as in the middle of the mokye-troops.

Shlok 30: That Sugreeva, the offspring of the Sun, who was endowed with a speed of the wind,
having accomplished that feat there, increasing the military zeal of the foremost of Raghu dynasty,
honoured by the monkey leaders and delighted, rejoined the army.



SARGA 41
------------------------------

[Text] Rama advises Sugreeva not to repeat such reckless acts in future on the ground of he 
being a king. Then Rama tells Lakshmana about the various evil portents he had seen. Rama commands the 
monkey-generals to besiege all the four gates of Lanka. He himself along with Lakshmana protects the 
army, besieging the northern gate being guarded by Ravana. Then, Rama sends Angada to Ravana, to expostulate 
him and to bring him back to reason. Angada tries his best to convince Ravana, but in vain. Ravana commands 
his attendants to seize Angada. Angada shakes out those attendants who tried to seize him ascends the 
roof of Ravana's palace, tramples ad crushes it down by his strength. Angada finally returns to Rama, 
who was stationed in the midst of the monkey-forces.

Shlok 1: Seeing the marks of conflict on the person of Sugreeva, Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana 
after embracing Sugreeva spoke these words.

Shlok 2: "Without consulting me closely, such a reckless act has been done by you, such a rashness 
is not seemly in a king."

Shlok 3: "O, warrior longing for acts of daring! This wrong and reckless act has been done by 
you, causing me, this army and Vibhishana great anxiety."

Shlok 4- 5: "O, warrior! O, vanquisher of foes! Do not act thus in future. O, the mighty armed! O, 
annihilator of enemies! If you have come by some misfortune, I would have had nothing to do with Seetha, 
Bharata, Lakshmana or still younger Shatrughna or even with my own person."

Shlok 6- 7: "O, monkey of great strength, equal to Indra the god of celestials and Varuna the king 
of universe! If you have not returned, though I am conversant with your valour, this was my pre-determined 
resolve that having killed Ravana in fight with his sons forces and chariots, I should have installed 
Vibhishana as king of Lanka, placing the kingdom of Ayodhya in the hands of Bharata and renounced my 
life."

Shlok 8- 9: Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva replied as follows: "O, brave Rama! Seeing Ravana who 
had taken away your consort and being conscious of my own strength, how can I act otherwise?"

Shlok 10: Complimenting that hero Sugreeva who was thus speaking, Rama addressed Lakshmana, who 
was endowed with auspicious marks, saying:

Shlok 11: "O, Lakshmana! Beside these fresh waters and trees laden with fruit, let us divide this 
multitude of troops, drawing it up in a battle array and remain alert."

Shlok 12: "I foresee a terrible calamity to come, boding universal destruction and death to the 
intrepid bears, monkeys and demons."

Shlok 13: "Harsh winds blow. The earth trembles. Mountain-peaks shake and the elephants bearing 
the earth trumpet."

Shlok 14: "Sinister clouds prey-roar violently like carnivorous animals and let fall a rain mixed 
with drops of blood."

Shlok 15: "The dusk, red as sandal, is full of horror and from the sun, this blazing mass of fire 
falls."

Shlok 16: "Wile beasts and birds emit frantic cries, ill at ease and ominous, inspiring great fear, 
facing the sun."

Shlok 17: "The moon shorn of its radiance, surrounded by black and fiery rays, burns red as at 
the time of destruction of the word and is creating an anguish in the night."

Shlok 18: "O, Lakshmana! In the disk of the sun, a small halo with a black mark, fiery, shorn of 
its radiance and of coppery hue is seen."

Shlok 19: "O, Lakshmana! The stars are not appearing as they should be duly foretelling their intention 
to hasten a final dissolution of the world."

Shlok 20: "Crows, eagles and vultures are whirling round at a lower level. Jackals too are howling 
inauspicious sounds."

Shlok 21: "The earth, crowded with rocks, darts and daggers discharged by monkeys and demons, will 
become a slime of flesh and blood."

Shlok 22: "Now surrounded by the monkeys from all sides, let us make an attack on that invincible 
citadel ruled by Ravana quickly and swiftly."

Shlok 23: Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the heroic Rama of great strength climbed down from that 
mountain-peak.

Shlok 24: Having descended from that mountain, Rama, whose mind was set on righeousness, held a 
review of his own army, which was verily difficult to conquer for the enemies.

Shlok 25: Rama, who knew the fitting moment to act, along with Sugreeva made ready the great army 
and commanded the army to advance, at the appropriate moment for the battle.

Shlok 26: Rama, the mighty armed, together with the mighty army marched in front, wielding a bow, 
towards the city of Lanka, at the befitting moment.

Shlok 27: Then, Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Hanuman, Jambavan the king of bears, Nala, Nila and Lakshmana 
accompanied that Rama.

Shlok 28: Thereafter, fully covering a vast stretch of land, the great army of bears and monkeys, 
followed in the wake of Rama.

Shlok 29: Monkeys, the annihilator of enemies, resembling elephants, took hold of mountain-peaks 
and hundreds of well-grown huge trees.

Shlok 30: Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the destroyers of their adversaries, reached the 
city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, in not a long time.

Shlok 31- 32: The monkeys, encouraged by the sound of Rama's voice and obedient to his command, halted 
before the city of Lanka, garlanded with banners, beautiful and splendid with pleasure-gardens, having 
an unusual rampart which is inaccessible with its elevated arched door-ways and invincible even by the 
celestials.

Shlok 33- 34- 35- 36: Reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, the heroic Rama the son of Dasaratha accompanied 
by Lakshmana, halted near the northern gate, where Ravana stayed. Who else but Rama is capable of protecting 
the army besieging that gate, regulated by Ravana, as an ocean, regulated by Varuna, guarded by awful 
demons on all sides and creating fear to the weak as a subterranean region is guarded by demons?

Shlok 37: Rama saw various types and multitude of weapons and shields kept there by the warriors.

Shlok 38: Nila, the valiant army-chief of monkeys together with Mainda and Dvivida reached and 
halted before the Eastern gate.

Shlok 39: Angada of very mighty prowess, together with Rishhabha, Gavaksha, Gaja and Gavaya took 
charge of the Southern gate.

Shlok 40: The strong monkey Hanuman together with Prajangha, Tarasa and other warriors, guarded 
the western gate.

Shlok 41: Sugreeva, along with all the chiefs of monkeys equal to the strength of Garuda (the eagle 
and the vehicle of Vishnu) as well as Vayu the god of the wind, was stationed himself in the middle 
of the fort.

Shlok 42: Thirty six crores of monkeys, highly renowned generals stood besiezed, where the monkey 
Sugreeva was there, having exerted pressure on the demons occupying that post.

Shlok 43: Meanwhile, under Rama's command, Lakshmana along with Vibhishana distributed a crore 
each of his monkeys at each gate.

Shlok 44: Behind Rama and not far from him, Sushena together with Jambavan, followed by a multitude 
of forces, stood at the intermediate post.

Shlok 45: Those lions among the monkeys, possessing the teeth of tigers, taking hold of trees and 
rocks, waited delightedly for the signal to fight.

Shlok 46: All of them were lashing their tails feverishly, using their jaws and nails as weapons, 
trembling in every limb and had their faces set grimly.

Shlok 47: Some were having the strength of ten elephants, some a ten times of that and some were 
equal to the strength of a thousand elephants.

Shlok 48: Some were having the strength of an ogha* of elephants. Some were endowed with a strength 
of ten times to that. some others there were chiefs of monkeys, having an immeasurable strength.

[Commentary] *For the number represented by on ogha vide canto 28, Sarga 37.

Shlok 49: Marvellous and astonishing was the gathering of those troops of monkeys there, like a 
swarm of locusts.

Shlok 50: By the monkeys who reached Lanka and by those stationed already beneath its walls, the 
air and earth seem to be completely filled.

Shlok 51: A hundred divisions of one lakh each of bears and monkeys poured towards the gates of 
Lanka, while others proceeded to fight on every side.

Shlok 52: Those monkeys covered the mountain on every side. A crore of them ranged round that city.

Shlok 53: Even winds were unable to penetrate Lanka being surrounded on all sides by heroic monkeys 
holding tree trunks in their hands.

Shlok 54: The demons, who in their valour equaled Indra the ruler of gods, seeing themselves besieged, 
as by clouds, were struck with sudden terror.

Shlok 55: While the flock of monkey- troops was advancing there, a tremendous clamour arose, resembling 
a roar in the ocean beating against its shore.

Shlok 56: By that great tumult, the entire Lanka with its ramparts arches, hills, woods and forests 
began to tremble.

Shlok 57: That army of monkeys, guarded by Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva became even more invinceible 
than all the celestials and demons put together.

Shlok 58- 59- 60: Having thus ranged his forces, with a view to destroy the demons, Rama who knew about 
the four expedients (to be used against an enemy in the shape of conciliation, gift, sowing dissension 
and punishment) employed in succession, took counsel again and again with his ministers and arrived 
at a decision. Calling to his mind the duty of the kings, Rama who was eager to undertake what was to 
be done next, in concurrence with Vibhishana, summoned Angada the son of Vali and spoke as follows:

Shlok 61: "Go my gentle Angada on my behalf and, passing thought the city of Lanka without fear 
and anxiety and Lanka without fear and anxiety and approaching Ravana - the unfortunate demon devoid 
of sovereignty and who has lost his splendour because of his inclination to die - admonish him in the 
following words:"

Shlok 62- 63- 63: "O, Ravana the Ranger of the Night! In your reckless arrogance, sages, celestials, celestial 
musicians and their wives, serpent - demons, yakshas the semi-divine beings and kings have been oppressed 
by you. From now on, that arrogance, born of the boon you received from Brahma the Lord of creation, 
shall be subdued."

Shlok 65: "I shall inflict a fitting penalty for your ruthless abduction of my consort. I am stationed 
myself at the gate of Lanka, with a Rod of chastisement."

Shlok 66: "O, demon! Slain by me, you will attain the region of Gods, of all the great sages and 
all the royal sages."

Shlok 67: "O, the worst demon! Demonstrate the same courage and magic that you did employ in bearing 
Seetha away from me."

Shlok 68: "If you do not make an appeal to my clemency by returning Seetha, I shall make this world 
devoid of all demons."

Shlok 69: "This pious minded Vibhishana, the foremost of demons has come to me. Surely, this illustrious 
demon will obtain the kingdom of Lanka, which will henceforth be free from troubles."

Shlok 70: "You, without a knowledge of the self and a sinful demon having stupid followers around 
you, cannot indeed enjoy the kingdom even for a moment, by this unrighteousness."

Shlok 71: "O, demon! Otherwise, get ready for a battle, by gathering courage and laying hold of 
your valour. Having been slain by my arrows in combat, you will be laid in peace.

Shlok 72: "O, Ranger of the Night! Even if you range the three worlds in the forms of a bird, you 
will not return alive, when you come into my range of sight."

Shlok 73: "I give you this salutary counsel prepare for your obsequies. Let Lanka be obliged to 
be seen well by you (like your last sight), as your survival is in my hands."

Shlok 74: Hearing the words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, Angada the son of Tara, leapt 
into air like a god of fire personified and marched ahead.

Shlok 75: Reaching Ravana's palace in an instant, the illustrious Angada saw Ravana, seated coolly 
along with his ministers.

Shlok 76: Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, wearing golden bracelets, descended close to the 
king and stood there like a flaming torch.

Shlok 77: Having made himself known, Angada communicated, that whole of the excellent speech of 
Rama without adding or subtracting anything to Ravana in the presence of Ravana's ministers, saying:

Shlok 78: "I am the son of Vali, Angada by name. I have come as a messenger for the king of Koshala, 
Rama of imperishable exploits. Has my name ever reached your ears?"

Shlok 79: "Rama who is born in Raghu dynasty and who augements the joy of Kausalya speaks thus 
to you, ï¿½O, ruthless demon! Come forth and enter into combat. Prove to be the representative of your 
race!' "

Shlok 80: " ï¿½I shall kill you along with your ministers, sons, cousins and other relatives. You 
being dead, all the three worlds will be rid of fear.'"

Shlok 81: " ï¿½Now, I shall uproot you, a thorn to sages and an enemy to celestials, demons, semi-divine 
beings, celestial musicians, serpent-gods and ogres'."

Shlok 82: "If you do not restore Seetha honourably, by bowing respectfully before me, you are slain 
and Vibhishana will become the king.'"

Shlok 83: Hearing these harsh words from Angada the lion among the monkeys, Ravana the Lord of 
the demon-tribe was infuriated.

Shlok 84: Then, the enraged Ravana repeatedly commanded his attendants, saying: "Let this stupid 
monkey be seized and put to death."

Shlok 85: Hearing Ravana's words, four terrible demons seized Angada who, in his splendour, resembled 
a blazing torch.

Shlok 86: Then, the prudent and heroic Angada the son of Tara voluntarily allowed himself to be 
seized, in order to display his prowess before the host of demons.

Shlok 87: Then, seizing like unto birds those attendants clung to his arms, Angada leapt on to 
the palace that resembled like a mountain.

Shlok 88: All those four demons were shaken out by Angada's impetuous leap and fell on the ground 
there under the eyes of their king.

Shlok 89: Thereafter, the glorious Angada the son of Vali ascended the roof of Ravana's palace, 
which equaled the summit of a mountain in height.

Shlok 90: That roof of the palace, trampled by Angada, crumbled - as a peak of Himalayan range 
was shattered long ago by lightening - before Ravana's gaze.

Shlok 91: After destroying the roof of the palace, Angada proclaimed his name and with a triumphant 
roar, rose into the air.

Shlok 92: Causing restlessness to all the demons but delight to the monkeys, Angada approached 
close to Rama, who was stationed in the middle of the monkey-forces.

Shlok 93: Because of the destruction of his palace, Ravana on his part got extremely angry. Foreseeing 
his own destruction, he became a desponded demon.

Shlok 94: Surrounded by many monkeys, roaring with delight, Rama on his part was proceeding ahead 
already for the battle, with an intent to wipe out the enemy.

Shlok 95: Now, Sushena the highly valiant monkey, was stationed there like the head of the mountain 
surrounded by innumerable monkeys, who were bale to change their form at will.

Shlok 96: Under the order of Sugreeva, the invincible monkey, Sushena was patrolling the gates 
and wandering like a moon among the stars.

Shlok 97- 98: Seeing hundreds of divisions of those monkeys encamped under the walls of Lanka, marshaled 
on the shores of the sea, the demons were amazed and some others were terror-struck while others, overjoyed 
at the prospect of fighting, leapt even in exultation.

Shlok 99: Those miserable demons saw the entire extensive space between the walls and the moat 
being occupied by the monkeys, like unto a second rampart. The demons cried out, "Woe! Alas!" in panic.

Shlok 100: As a result of that appalling tumult in the capital city of the demons, the soldiers 
of Ravana seized hold of their great weapons and sallied forth like the winds that blow at the dissolution 
of the worlds.

[Text] The demons break the news to Ravana about Lanka. Ravana having been laid siege to by
the monkeys. Ravana then ascends his mansion and surveys the innumerable troops of monkeys,
occupying the entire city of Lanka. Meanwhile, Rama issues a command to the monkeys to destroy the
enemies forthwith. The monkeys start demolishing various important defensive structures of the city
of Lanka and besiege all the city-gates. Ravana also commands his army to commence combat. Sounds
of couches blown by the army and terrible roars on both sides re-echoes the air, earth and sea.

and saw Lanka being guarded on all sides and thronged with demons.

Shlok 7: Seeing that city of Lanka duly decorated with banners and flags, Rama remembered
Seetha with a distressed heart.

Shlok 8: He said to himself, "Here is that daughter of Janaka, whose eyes resemble those of a
fawn, tormented with grief, emacitated, with a bare ground as her bed and suffering here on my
account."

Shlok 9: Reflecting on Seetha being troubled, the virtuous Rama speedily issued a command to
the monkeys to destroy the enemies forthwith.

Shlok 10: Hearing those words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, the monkeys vying with one
another filled the air with their roaring resembling those of lion.

Shlok 11: "We shall tear asunder this Lanka with mountain-peaks or with fists alone." - thus
resolved all the monkey- generals.

Shlok 12: Lifting up mountain peaks and huge rocks and plucking up various kinds of trees, the
monkey-generals stood prepared (for the attack).

Shlok 13: In order to fulfill Rama's cherished desire, those troops, forming themselves into
columns, began to scale the heights of Lanka, while Ravana stood gazing.

rushed towards the defensive walls of Lanka.

Shlok 22: Those monkey-generals Virabahu, Subahu, Nala and Panasa, having position on them.
Meanwhile, they formed an encampment of a multitude of military divisions there.

Shlok 23: The mighty Kumuda, surrounded by a crore of monkeys, who behaved like conquerors,
stood besieging the eastern gate (while remaining stationed in north-east).

Shlok 24: Surrounded by other monkeys, a monkey called Prasabha and the mighty armed Panasa
too up their position, in order to assist Kumuda himself.

the exit.

monkeys, stood besieging that gate.

Shlok 28: Accompanied by a crore of bears having terrific rage, Dhumra (brother of Jambavan,
the king of bears) of great prowess and the annihilator of enemies, took up his position by the
side of Rama.

Shlok 29: Vibhishana of great energy with mace in hand, clad in defensive armour and
accompanied by his watchful ministers, took his position where the mighty Rama is stationed.

Shlok 30: Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha and Gandhamadana, galloping on all sides, defended the
army of monkeys.

Shlok 31: Ravana the lord of demons with his mind filled in anger, then commanded for the
decamping of the entire army immediately.

Shlok 32: At this command coming from Ravana lips, a tremendous clamour arose among the
demons.

Shlok 33: By beating with sticks of gold, the demons stirred up on every side, kettle drums
whose discs were white as the moon.

Shlok 34: Hundreds and thousands of sonorous couches blared forth, blown with their cheeks
extended to the full, by the most ghastly demons.

Shlok 35: With their handsome limbs equipped with couches, those rangers of night shone like
clouds bordered with lightning accompanied by rows of cranes.

Shlok 36: The battalions rushed forth under Ravana's instructions like the rushing forth of
the ocean, which is swollen by the clouds, at the time of universal dissolution.

Shlok 37: Then, from every side a clamour, arose from the army of monkeys, which filled Malaya
mountain with its ridges, plains and caves.

Shlok 38: The sound of couches and drums made by the demons and the leouine roars of those
monkey- warriors re-echoed over the earth, sky and sea.

Shlok 39: With the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of the horses, the clattering of the
chariot-wheels and the sounds of the foot-steps, the sound of the couches reechoed over the earth,
sky and sea.

Shlok 40: In the meantime, a terrible struggle ensued between the demons and the monkeys, as
in the former times between celestials and demons.

Shlok 41: Exhibiting their native prowess, the demons began to strike all the monkeys with
their flaming maces, spears, harpoons and axes.

Shlok 42- 43: Then, the gigantic monkeys swiftly struck those demons with trees, mountain-tops,
nails and teeth "Victorious is king Sugreeva" - thus arose a loud war-cry.

Shlok 44: Then, some other terrifying demons on their part, shouting "Be winsome! Be
victorious!", proclaimed their own respective names. While some demons standing on walls hacked at
the monkeys standing on the ground (below) with hooks and harpoons.

Shlok 45: The enraged monkeys, who wee standing on the ground, leapt into the air and dragged
down the demons stationed on the walls by seizing them with their arms.

battle and laughed continuously.

battle.

gold and made a roaring sound.

Shlok 36: Sushena the excellent monkey, seeing him mounted on a chariot, quickly caused the
chariot to fall down, by a huge rock.

Shlok 37: Retreating soon from the chariot, Vidyunmali the demon endowed with a skill, stood
on the ground with a mace in his hand.

Shlok 38: Then, the excellent monkey, Sushena engulfed as he was with anger, seizing a very
huge rock in his hands, chased that demon.

Shlok 39: Vidyunmali the ranger of the night; struck that approaching Sushena the excellent
monkey, quickly with a mace on his chest.

excellent monkey silently threw that huge rock on his chest.

Shlok 41: Struck by the thump of that rock, Vidyunmali the demon, his chest crushed, fell
lifeless on the earth.

Shlok 42: Those strong demons were destroyed thus by those valiant monkeys there in a series
of hand to hand encounters, as the demons were destroyed by the blows of the celestials.

Shlok 43- 44: The battle-field became frightening with extra-ordinary spears, other arrows, maces,
javelins, lances and some other weapons with three points, shattered chariots and military steeds
elephants in rut, monkeys and demons which had been killed, wheels axles and yokes broken and lying
on the ground and frequented as it was by herds of jackals.

Shlok 45: The headless trunks of monkeys and demons sprang up here and there in the midst of
that tumultuous conflict, which resembled the war between celestials and demons.

Shlok 46: Then, the rangers of the night, with their limbs anointed with blood after being
attacked by the excellent monkeys, longed for sun-set and again with strength, assembled for a good
combat.



SARGA 44
------------------------------

[Text] A nocturnal was commences between the hostile demons and monkeys. The demons destroy
some monkeys. The monkeys drag and kill elephants, chariots and their occupants. Rama and Lakshmana
even in that darkness kill the foremost of demons. As a result of the struggle, streams of blood
flow in the battle-field. That fatal night transforms into a night of dissolution. When some demons
attack Rama with arrows, Rama strikes down six of the demons within a moment and they run away for
life. Rama then clears off innumerable demons from the battle filed. Angada strikes Indrajit, his
chariot and the charioteer all at once, but Indrajit vanishes from the spot. Sugreeva and his
monkeys feel delighted and praise Angada's prowess. Indrajit comes back in an invisible form and by
recourse to magic, makes Rama and Lakshmana captive by hurling a net work of serpentine around
them.

Shlok 1: While those monkeys and demons were fighting, the sun sank below the horizon,
setting in motion a night of carnage.

Shlok 2: Then, a nocturnal was commenced between the terrific monkeys and demons, who
contracted hostility with each other, wishing for their victory.

Shlok 3: "You are a demon" said the monkeys "You are a monkey" said the demons and killed at
each other in battle; during that dreadful darkness.

Shlok 4: "Strike!" "Tear asunder!" "come near!" "Why are you running away?" - very tumultuous
sounds like this could be heard in that army.

Shlok 5: The black demons in that darkness, wearing golden mails, were appearing as mountains
with groves of medicinal plants emitting their light.

Shlok 6: In that darkness, which was difficult to be overcome, the demons agitated as they
were with anger, attacked with great speed, duly destroying the monkeys.

Shlok 7: Those strong monkeys with a terrific rage leapt forward and tore asunder by their
sharp teeth, the steeds with gold ornaments on their head, the serpentine banners and frightened
the demoniac army.

Shlok 8: Agitated with anger, the monkeys dragged the elephants and those mounted on them and
also the chariots with their banners and flag-staffs duly breaking them to pieces with their
teeth.

Shlok 9: Rama and Lakshmana killed the foremost of the demons, both those who were visible
and those who were invisible, with their arrows resembling venomous snakes.

Shlok 10: The dust rising from the hooves of horses and the wheels of the chariots blocked the
ears and the eyes of the combatants.

Shlok 11: While that terrible battle was taking place, causing the hair to bristle; very
terrible rivers with streams of blood were flowing there.

Shlok 12: There arose a marvelous sound of kettle drums and tabors, mixed with the sounds of
counches, fellies of chariot-wheels and drums.

Shlok 13: There appeared a terrific sound resonated by horses, demons and monkeys being
wounded.

Shlok 14- 15: The assassinated great monkeys, spears, maces, axes and the slaughtered demons, who
were able to change their form at will and with their bodies appearing like mountains were lying
there on the battle-field. And those weapons appeared to be offered up as a profusion of flowers by
the earth, which became hidden and rendered impassable by the slime formed out of streams of
blood.

Shlok 16: That fatal night became as calamitous to the monkeys and demons, as a night of
dissolution, which is difficult to be overcome by all beings.

Shlok 17: In that very terrible darkness, those demons thrilling with rapture attacked Rama
with showers of arrows.

Shlok 18: Yelling in fury, the sound of those demons approaching in order to assault Rama was
like the noise of the oceans at the time of destruction of all the creatures.

Shlok 19: Within a twinkling of an eye, Rama with six sharp arrows resembling tongues of
flame, struck down six of those demons.

Shlok 20- 21: The unconquerable Yagnashatru, Mahaparashva, Mahodara, the giant bodied
Vajradamshtra, both Shuka and Sarana - all those six having been beaten by Rama on their vital
organs with a flood of his arrows, retreated from the battle and somehow survived for the rest of
their life.

Shlok 22: Rama the great warrior, merely within an instant, made the quarters and the
intermediate quarters, clear of all the demons, by his arrows resembling flames of fire.

Shlok 23: The other valiant demons, who were standing with their face turning towards Rama,
also perished like moths, having encountered the same fire.

Shlok 24: That night, with the golden shafts of arrows, flying on all sides, appeared
bright-coloured, like an autumnal night with its fire-flies on all sides.

Shlok 25: The terrible night on that day became more terrible again by the sound of
kettle-drums and by the roaring sounds of the demons.

Shlok 26: By that great sound, which re-echoed on all sides, the mountain Trikuta, full of
caves, appeared to be uttering confused murmurs.

Shlok 27: Long-tailed and black faced monkeys with their gigantic bodies and dark-like figure,
crushed the demons with their arms and allowed them to be eaten (by jackals, vultures etc).

Shlok 28: Angada on his part, who came to annihilate the enemies in that battle-field, struck
Indrajit, his charioteer and the horses all at once.

Shlok 29- 30: While that awful and very intense battle was going on, Indrajit a great trickster,
leaving the chariot, with its horses and charioteer killed by Angada, vanished from that very spot
itself.

Shlok 31: All the celestials, both Rama and Lakshmana together with all sages were pleased
with that act of the venerable Angada the son of Vali.

Shlok 32: Since all the living beings knew the supernatural powers of Indrajit in battle, they
were pleased on seeing that highly gifted demon being defeated by Angada.

Shlok 33: Seeing the enemy defeated, those monkeys along with Sugreeva and Vibhishana were
delighted and praised Angada as an efficient warrior.

Shlok 34: Indrajit, on the other hand, then was driven to a very terrible rage, as he was
defeated in battle by Angada the son of Vali a dreadful monkey.

Shlok 35: That Indrajit the son of Ravana, the sinful demon who had gone out of sight and was
cruel in battle, rendered himself as invisible again and hurled forth sharp arrows, bright as
lightning.

Shlok 36: Being enraged in battle, Indrajit bursted out serpent-like terrible arrows into all
the limbs of Rama and Lakshmana who were born in Raghu dynasty.

Shlok 37: Enveloped by illusion, he sought to confuse Rama and Lakshmana in the struggle there
and invisible to all beings through his magic arts, Indrajit the ranger of the night bound those
two brothers Rama and Lakshmana with a net work of arrows.

Shlok 38: Then, the monkeys saw the two warriors, those lions among men, being wounded quickly
by the serpentine arrows of that enraged demons.

Shlok 39: Not being able to hurt those two princes in his manifest form, Indrajit the son of
the king of demons with his perverse mind, had recourse to magic in order to make them captive.

[Text] Rama orders ten of the monkey-generals to search for the whereabouts of Indrajit. But 
Indrajit arrested the approach of those monkeys, by means of his arrows. Both Rama and Lakshmana were 
transfixed by Indrajit with a net work of serpentine arrows into the vital parts of Rama and Lakshmana 
and they fall down on the battle-ground in a bath of blood. Seeing those two scions of Raghu in that 
state, the monkeys give way to utter despondence.

Shlok 1: That very strong and powerful Rama the son of Dasaratha ordered ten monkey-generals to 
search for the whereabouts of Indrajit.

Shlok 2- 3: Rama the scourger of his enemies ordered both the sons of Sushena, Nila the chief of 
monkeys, Angada the son of Vali, the stron Sharabha, Dvivida, Hanuman, the very strong Sanuprastha, 
Rishabha and Rishabha skandha.

Shlok 4: All those monkeys, thrilled with enthusiasm, flung into the air brandishing huge trunks 
of trees in order to explore the ten regions.

Shlok 5: Indrajit, the son of Ravana, who was skilled in the use of magic weapons, by means of 
his arrows with great speed, released from his most excellent of bows, arrested the impetuous outbreak 
of the monkeys.

Shlok 6: Those monkeys of terrific bound, whose bodes were cruelly pierced by those shafts, were 
unable to see Indrajit in the darkness, as the sun is obscured when veiled in clouds.

Shlok 7: Indrajit, the victorious in battle, transfixed Rama and Lakshmana with those arrows that 
lacerated their flesh in great measure.

Shlok 8: The bodies of both those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana were densely transfixed with serpentine 
arrows by the enraged Indrajit.

Shlok 9: Blood flowed from the wound-marks of both Rama and Lakshmana and both of them shone like 
Kimshuka trees in flowring.

Shlok 10: At that instant, though still invisible, Indrajit, Ravana's son, with his inflamed eyes, 
which resembled a mass of collyrium mixed with oil, spoke the following words to those two brothers.

Shlok 11: "When I enter into combat, making myself invisible, even Indra the lord of celestials 
is not able to see or approach me. How much less, you two!"

Shlok 12: "O, Descendents of Raghu! Having imprisoned you in this net work of arrows furnished 
with heron's feathers, I, yielding myself up to the violence of my wrath, am about to dispatch you to 
the region of Yama the Lord of Death."

Shlok 13: Speaking thus to the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, who were aware of righteousness, Indrajit 
pierced them with pointed arrows and shouted too exultantly.

Shlok 14: Indrajit, who was as black as a heap of shattered collyrium, stretching his immense bow, 
discharged formidable arrows even once more, in that great fight.

Shlok 15: That warrior, Indrajit, who was aware of their vital parts, set up a continual shouting, 
digging sharp arrows into the vital parts of Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 16: Those two princes, in the forefront of battle, bounded by that net work of arrows in 
the twinkling of an eye, became incapable of even looking up.

Shlok 17- 18: Pierced in their vital parts, exhausted, and covered all over with heads of arrows, those 
two mighty and courageous archers fell to the earth, they who were the lords of the earth, shaking violently 
like a pair of flag-staffs in honour of Indra the Lord celestials and freed from their raised of chords.

Shlok 19: Those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, lying on that heroes' bed (on the battle-ground), 
bathed in blood, all their limbs bristling with arrows and extremely injured, felt distressed.

Shlok 20: There was not a finger's breadth on their bodies form the tips of their fingers to the 
end of their feet that was not lacerated, implanted and pierced by those arrows.

Shlok 21: Struck down by that ferocious demon, who was able to change his shape at will, the hot 
blood gushed forth from both Rama and Lashmana, as water from a spring.

Shlok 22: Rama fell first, his vital parts pierced by arrows of the wrathful Indrajit, who had 
formerly vanquished Indra the Lord of celestials.

Shlok 23: Indrajit pierced Rama by arrows with golden shafts, with sharp points, which had downward 
movement, which go fast, Narchas, Demi-narachas, Bhallas (with wide tips), Anjalis, Vatsa dantas, Simha 
dantas and those shafts like unto razors.

Shlok 24: Throwing asunder his bow bent at three places, adorned with gold, with its string loosened 
away and detached from the hold of his fist, Rama lied down on the battle-ground.

Shlok 25: Seeing Rama the excellent man fallen, at a distance of an arrows range, Lakshman became 
hopeless about his own life.

Shlok 26: Seeing his elder brother Rama, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, having fallen on 
the ground, wounded as he was by a net work of arrows, Lakshmana felt sad.

Shlok 27: Beholding that Rama, the monkeys too were in great grief and wept terribly, with their 
eyes filled in tears, being afflicted as they were by sorrow.

Shlok 28: Those monkeys with Hanuman in first place gathered at a place and stood surrounding Rama 
and Lakshmana, who wee bound by a net work of arrows and lying down on the battle ground. They were 
disturbed and afflicted sorrow.



SARGA 46
------------------------------

[Text] The monkeys along with Hanuman and Angada begin to grieve, on beholding the plight
of Rama and Lakshmana who were entwined in a net work of arrows. Indrajit informs demons about his
adventure of captivating both Rama and Lakshmana by his net work of serpentine arrows. Indrajit
strikes the other monkey-cheifs like . Nila, Mainda, Dvivida, Hanuman, Gavaksha and Angada as also
Jambavan. When Sugreeva looks depressed on seeing the plight of Rama and Lakshmana, Vibhishana
consoles him, saying that Rama is not going to die. He also reassures the disheartened monkeys and
infuses confidence in them. Indrajit, in the meanwhile, informs Ravana that both Rama and Lakshmana
have been killed. Ravana applauds his son for his daring act.

Shlok 1: Thereafter, surveying the earth and the sky, the monkeys beheld the brothers Rama
and Lakshmana, covered with arrows.

Shlok 2: Then, along with Sugreeva, Vibhishana came to that place, after Indrajit finished
his work and retired; even as Indra* would, after raining.

[Commentary] ï¿½ Indra: The god of the sky and the given of rain.

Shlok 3: Nila, Dvivida, Mainda, Sushena, kumuda, Angada along with Hanuman forthwith began to
grieve for Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 4- 5- 6- 7: Breathing but faintly, bathed in blood; riddled with innumerable arrows, motionless
and lying inactive, they lay stretched on a bed of arrows, sighing like serpants, helpless, having
little prowess, their limbs smeared with a stream of blood, resembling two golden standards, and
lying on heroes' couch, those warriors with tardy movement of their limbs, were surrounded by their
monkey-leaders, whose eyes were suffused with tears. Seeing the two Raghavas, pierced by a
multitude of arrows, all the monkeys along with Vibhishana became perturbed.

Shlok 8: The monkeys surveyed all the quarters in the sky, without being able to discover
Indrajit (the son of Ravana), who was veiled by his magic powers in the fight.

Shlok 9: Vibhishana, beholding by his magic arts, saw that nephew, standing nearby, duly
hidden by his occult power.

Shlok 10: Althought that warrior who had no peer in the field and who had unique exploits, had
made himself invisible by virtue of the boon he had received, he was recognized by Vibhishana, who
was full of energy, glory and prowess.

Shlok 11: Contemplating his own feat, Indrajit gazed on those two warriors, stretched on the
earth and in excess of joy, wishing to share it with all the demons, said.

Shlok 12: "The exceedingly strong brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the killers of Khara and
Dushana have been killed by my arrows."

Shlok 13: "Even were they aided by the gods and demons with the host of sages, these two
brothers would never be able to release themselves from those arrows that paralyse them."

Shlok 14- 15: "This non- sensical pest, which was wearing away the very roots of us all, on whose
account, the three watches of the night slipped past my father, who is unable even to touch his
couch with his limbs, who remains absorbed in thought and stricken with grief and because of whom,
the entire city of Lanka remains agitated, like a river during the rains, has ban destroyed by
me."

Shlok 16: "As clouds are useless in the autumn, so are all the exploits of Rama, Lakshmana and
all the monkeys."

Shlok 17: Thus speaking to all those demons, Indrajit the son of Ravana (by his arrows0 struck
the monkey chief.

Shlok 18: Striking Nila with nine arrows, Indrajit the destroyer of foes tormented Mainda and
Dvivida with three superb arrows on each.

Shlok 19: Indrajit the wielder of a great bow smacked the chest-region of Jambavan with an
arrow and released ten arrows towards Hanuman, the swift monkey.

Shlok 20: Indrajit the son of Ravana of great swiftness, struck both Gavaksha and Sharabha of
unbounded valour with two arrows on each of them, in that battle.

Shlok 21: Thereafter, Indrajit the son of Ravana swiftly with his various arrows, struck
Gavaksha (the ruler of golangulas) and then Angada the son of Vali too.

Shlok 22: Indrajit, that strong and highly courageous demons, pierced those jewels among the
monkeys there with his arrows which resembled flames of fire and began to shout in triumph.

Shlok 23: Tormenting them with a multitude of arrows and frightening the monkeys, the mighty
armed Indrajit heartily laughed and spoke (as follows).

Shlok 24: "O, demons! At the forefront of the army, behold those two brothers (Rama and
Lakshmana) bound together by me by a terrible net work of my arrows."

Shlok 25: All those demons, the treacherous fighters on their part, after hearing the words of
Indrajit, were seized with a great wonder and were overjoyed.

Shlok 26: All of them cheered Indrajit unanimously with a roar like unto thunder, crying "Rama
is dead".

Shlok 27: Seeing the two brothers - Rama and Lakshmana lying motionless and breathless on the
floor, Indrajit thought they were dead.

Shlok 28: Indrajit, full of joy and victorious in conflict, returned to Lanka, spreading
happiness among the demons.

Shlok 29: Seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddle with arrows and pierced in every limb and bone of
their bodies, a great fear had taken possession of Sugreeva.

Shlok 30: Vibhishana then spoke to that Sugreeva, who was frightened, whose eyes were filled
with tears, looking helpless and whose eyes were agitated in grief.

Shlok 31: "Have no fear, O Sugreeva! Stay this rush of tears. Wars are like this. Victory is
not certain."

Shlok 32: "O, warrior! If a remnance of luck is there with us, the highly-souled and the
exceedingly strong Rama and Lakshmana will drive off this loss of consciousness."

Shlok 33: "O, Sugreeva! Be courageous and bring about courage in me, having no protector. For
those who are devoted to truth and righteousness, there is no fear of death."

Shlok 34: Thus speaking, Vibhishana then wiped the charming eyes of Sugreeva with his hand
moistened in water.

Shlok 35: Then, the pious minded Vibhishana took water, enchanted it with an incantation and
wiped the eyes of Sugreeva.

Shlok 36: Having dried the face of the wise Sugreeva Vibhishana spoke the following words full
of good sense and comfort.

Shlok 37: "O, Sugreeva the king of monkeys! This is not the time to cling to despondency. At
this hour, even too much attachment leads to death."

Shlok 38: "Therefore, abandoning your despair, which ruins all actions, focus now on how best
to serve the troops which have Rama going before them.

Shlok 39: "Or else, let Rama be protected till he regains consciousness. Having regained
consciousness, Rama and Lakshmana can indeed drive away the fear of both of us."

Shlok 40: "This is nothing to Rama nor Rama is going to die. The bodily splendour, which is
difficult to be found in those whose longevity of life has run out; is not abandoning him."

Shlok 41: "Therefore console yourself and call on your prowess, till I restore confidence in
the entire ranks."

Shlok 42: "O, the foremost of monkeys! These monkeys, having their eyes dilated due to fear,
are signaling some words into each other's ear, terrified as they were."

Shlok 43: "Let the monkeys cast off their fear, even as one would discard a used garland, on
seeing me running about to activate the troops."

Shlok 44: Having emboldened Sugreeva, Vibhishana the foremost of demons once again reassured
that army of monkeys, who were pushing away.

Shlok 45: Indrajit, the great conjurer, surrounded by all his forces, re-entered the city of
Lanka.

Shlok 46: Approaching Ravana there and saluting with joined palms, Indrajit informed his
father in pleasing words that both Rama and Lakshmana had been slain.

Shlok 47: Hearing in the midst of demons, the news that both the enemies having been killed,
Ravana forthwith sprang on his feet in joy and embraced his son.

Shlok 48- 49: Smelling on his head, Ravana delighted at heard, made enquiries in the matter.
Indrajit reported the matter as it happened, to his enquiring father, as to how both Rama and
Lakshmana were made motion-less and luster-less by entwining them with arrows.

Shlok 50: Hearing the words of Indrajit the great charioteer, Ravana with his heart filled
with a gush of joy, relinquished his anguish, caused on account of Rama and applauded his son with
pleasing words.



SARGA 47
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana summons some female demons including Trijata and instructs them to take
Seetha in Pushpaka-plane to the battle-front and show Rama and Lakshmana alleged to have been
killed by Indrajit. Accordingly, the female-demons take Seetha in Pushpaka-plane and show her Rama
and Lakshmana lying unconscious on a bed of arrows in the battle-field. Imagining Rama and
Lakshmana to have been dead, Seetha bursts into sobs.

Shlok 1: Indrajit, the son of Ravana having returned to Lanka, his purpose accomplished, the
leading monkeys surrounded Rama in order to watch over him.

Shlok 2- 3- 4: Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Sushena, Kumuda, Nala, Gaja, Gavaksha, Panasa, Sanuprastha
and the mighty Jambavan with Sunda, Rambha, Shatabali and Prithu all these monkeys, armed with
trees, reorganized their ranks, stood alert, surveyed the quarters of the sky up and down and on
every side and, even if a grass stirred, they exclaimed, "It is a demon!"

Shlok 5: Ravana, meanwhile, full of joy, dismissed his son Indrajit and thereafter summoned
the female demons who guarded Seetha.

Shlok 6: Following his orders, the female-demons along with Trijata appeared before him.
Then, the rejoiced Ravana said to them as follows:

Shlok 7: "Tell Seetha that Rama and Lakshmana have been killed by Indrajit. Take her in
Pushpaka the aeroplane and show her Rama and Lakshman who were killed in battle."

Shlok 8: "Her husband, the one depending on whom rendered her so proud that she refused to be
united with me, lies there killed with his brother in the battle-front."

Shlok 9: "From now on, free from anxiety, grief and expectation of reunion, Seetha the
princess of Mithila kingdom, adorned in all her jewels, will submit herself to me."

Shlok 10: "Beholding Rama and Lakshmana fallen under the sway of death on the battle-field
today, finding no other haven and hoping for nothing else, the large-eyed Seetha will voluntarily
seek refuge with me!"

Shlok 11: Hearing these words of the cruel Ravana, they all replied, "Be it so" and went to
where the Pushpaka chariot was.

Shlok 12: Thereafter, the female-demons brought the aerial car, Pushpaka as per the
instructions of Ravana and carried it nearer to Seetha who was staying in Ashoka-grove.

Shlok 13: The female-demons brought Seetha who was afflicted with grief for her husband and
made her to ascend Pushpaka-plane.

Shlok 14: The female-demons along with Trijata made Seetha to ascend Pushpaka-plane and
proceeded to show her Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 15- 16: Ravana the king of demons, thrilled with rapture, caused Lanka to be garlanded with
flags and banners and arranged a proclamation to be made in Lanka announcing that Rama and
Lakshmana had been slain by Indrajit in battle.

Shlok 17: Seetha along with Trijata, transported by that plane, saw all the monkey-troops who
had been slain.

Shlok 18: Seetha saw the demons who were delighted at heart and monkeys disturbed with grief,
standing round Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 19- 20: Then, Seetha beheld those two warriors Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious on the
ground on a bed of arrows, their limbs pierced with arrows, riddled with weapons, their armour
shattered, their bows cast aside at a distance and their entire body transfixed by darts.

Shlok 21- 22: On seeing those two brothers, who were filled with valour, having lotus-eyes, the
excellent of men, lying streteched on a bed of arrows there in that wretched plight like the two
sons of the fire-god (Shkha and Vishakha) lying on a bed of reeds, Seetha wailed piteously,
stricken as she was with a great agony.

Shlok 23: The dark-eyed Seetha the daughter of Janaka with her faultless limbs, beholding her
lord and Lakshmana lying in the dust, burst into sobs.

Shlok 24: Witnessing those brothers, the prominent sons of god, Seetha afflicted with tearful
sorrow, believing their death, spoke with grief the following words.



SARGA 48
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha, on beholding Rama and Lakshmana, was absorbed in various thoughts like, "The
sooth sayers had prophesied that I should never be widowed and would bear sons. How could their
prediction become untrue?" However, Trijata reassures her, stating good reasons for Rama and
Lakshman to be still alive and cheering her up, takes her back to Ashoka grove.

Shlok 1: Seeing her husband and the mighty Lakshmana having been killed, Seetha was very much
emaiated through grief and lamented pitiably (as follows):

Shlok 2: "The sooth sayers, reading the marks and signs on my body, prophesized that I shall
bear sons and never be widowed. Now that Rama has been slain, their words have proved to be
untrue."

Shlok 3: "Since Rama is slian, all those astrologers, who predicted that I shold be the
companio of a sattra sacrifice and the consort of the performer of great sacrifices, now have
proved to be utteres of falsehood."

Shlok 4: "Now that Rama has been slain, all those sooth-sayers who predicted that I should be
honoured by my husband as well as the wives of warriors and kings, are proved to be liars."

Shlok 5: "Now that Rama has been slain, all those astrologers among the wise brahmins. Who
openly foretold that I should remain happy with my husband are proved to have spoken falsely!"

Shlok 6: "Yet I bear the marks of lotus on my soles by virtue of which high-born women are
consecrated on an imperial throne with their husbands and lords."

Shlok 7: "I do not find those marks of ill-fortune which betoken widowhood in women who are
ill-starred and as I examine, all the auspicious signs appear to be rendered void for me."

Shlok 8: "Those marks of the lotus said to be good angury for women by wise men, have become
meaningless, now that Rama is slain."

Shlok 9: "My hair is fine, black in colour and smooth. My eye-brows are disunited. My shanks
are hair-less and well rounded. My teeth are contiguous, without any gaps between them."

Shlok 10: "My temples, eyes, arms, feet, ankles and thights are homogenous and
well-proportioned. My fingers have well-rounded and glossy nails, having a right lenght."

Shlok 11: "My breasts are close to each other, fully developed and have depressed nipples. My
navel is deeply idented. My flanks and bossom are well-formed."

Shlok 12: "My complexion has the sheen of a pearl. The hair on my skin are soft. It is said of
me as endowed with auspicious signs, in that I touched the ground with my twelve limbs (viz. the
ten toes and two soles).

Shlok 13: "Those who interpret the marks of youthful maidens spoke of me that my hands and
feet are rosy, fully provided with marks each resembling a barley corn, devoid of space between my
fingers and toes and that my smile is gentle."

Shlok 14: "All that was told by brahmins well-versed in sooth-saying, of me that- I should be
consecrated on the imperial throne along with my husband -proved to be in vain."

Shlok 15: "Having searched all the resorts of men, received the tidings of my fate, and
crossed the impassable ocean, those two brothers have perishe din the imprint of a cow's hoof ( a
small puddle)."

Shlok 16: "Rama and Lakshmana surely knew the use of the arrows of Varuna, Agni, Indra and
Vayu, as also the Brahmashira weapon."

Shlok 17: "By means of magic arts, an invisible foe has slain Rama and Lakshmana, my
protectors, who are equal to Indra in battle and I am now bereft of any support."

Shlok 18: "Having reached the range of sight of Rama in a combat, no enemy could return alive,
eventhough he were endowed with the swiftness of thought."

Shlok 19: There is no burden too heavy for death to shoulder, as Rama along with his brother
are lying struck down on the battle-field. Fate is inexorable."

Shlok 20: "I do not repent so much for Rama and Lakshmana or for myself or even my mother but
for my unfortunate mother-in-law, Kausalya."

Shlok 21: "Kausalya for her part, forever remains absorbed in the thought 'When shall I see
Lakshmana and Seetha with Rama returned (to Ayodhya) having completed his vow (of remaining in
exile in the forest for fourteen years)?"

Shlok 22: The demoness Trijata spoke to that lamenting Seetha as follows : "O, the god-like
lady! Do not despair. Your husband, Rama is still living."

Shlok 23: "O, godlike lady! I will tell you mighty and cogent reasons, how these two brothers
Rama and Lakshmana are living."

Shlok 24: "The leader having been lost, the faces of the soldiers on the field of battle are
never seized by anger nor are they animated with joy."

Shlok 25: "O, Seetha! This aerial car called Pushpaka by name, celestial as it is, would not
have brought you here, if those two heroes have lost their lives."

Shlok 26: "An army that sees its valiant commander falll, is bereft of courage and wanders
aimlessly about on the battle field, like a ship which has broken its rudder in water."

Shlok 27: "This army for its part is neither confused nor perturbed and is guarding Rama and
Lakshman. I am pointing this out to you on account of my affection for you, O lady given to
austerities!"

Shlok 28: "You as such, be reassured by these auspicious omens. Behold Rama and Lakshman who
are not dead. I am telling you this, on account of my affection for you."

Shlok 29: "O, Seetha! I have not spoken falsehood before, nor shall I ever do so. By your
conduct and natural gaiety, you have found a place in my heart!"

Shlok 30: "Even celestials and demons along with Indra cannot vanquish there two heroes in
battle. This is what I have observed and communicated to you."

Shlok 31: "O Seetha!; See this, a great marvel !; See how, fallen under those shafts and
deprived of their senses, thier beauty has not deserted them."

Shlok 32: "Generally, the faces of those who lost their lives and whose vital power has
vanished, will be appearing with an appalling alteration".

Shlok 33: "O, Seetha! Banish your grief, pain and ignorance on account of Rama and Lakshmana.
It is impossible, now with the splendour seen in their faces, for Rama and Lakshmana to die."

Shlok 34: Hearing her words, Seetha, the daughter of Mithila kingdom resembling a daughter of
gods, with joined palms exclaimed, "May it be so."

Shlok 35: After sending back that aerial car, Pushpaka which was as swift as the thought, the
sorrowful Seetha was caused by Trijata to enter Lanka once more.

Shlok 36: Thereafter, Seetha along with Trijata who descended from Pshpaka the aerial car,
were caused by the female demons, to enter the Ashoka grove again.

Shlok 37: Entering that Ashoka grove, planted with a multitude of trees, sporting ground of
Ravana and recalling the two princes who she had just seen, Seetha gave way to extreme grief.



SARGA 49
------------------------------

[Text] Returning to consciousness, Rama laments over the plight of Lakshmana, who was lying
unconscious. The foremost of monkeys too were plunged in grief and despondency on seeing Rama
lamenting as aforesaid. In the meantime, Vibhishana approaches Rama and the monkeys flee away,
mistaking him as Indrajit.

Shlok 1- 2: Bound by that formidable network of arrows, the two high-souled sons of dasaratha
lay bathed in blood, breathing like serpants. All those foremost of monkeys who were exceedingly
strong, including Sugreeva, plunged in grief, were standing around those two illustrious
warriors.

Shlok 3: In the meanwhile, the mighty Rama by virtue of his hardihood and native strength,
awoke from his swwon, despite the shafts that held him captive.

Shlok 4: Then, beholding his brother, bleeding unconscious, firmly thrown on teh floor, and
his features changed, Rama full of grief lamented thus:

Shlok 5: "Of what use to me is the recovery of Seetha or even life itself, since my brother
now lying, before my eyes, has been struck down in teh fight?"

Shlok 6: "It can be possible, if I were to look for her, to find a consort equal to Seetha in
this world of mortals but not a brother, a friend and a comrade in a hostile war, such as
Lakshmana!"

Shlok 7: "If Lakshmana returned to the five elements, he the increaser of Sumitra's joy, I
will yield up my life-breaths while the monkeys stand looking on."

Shlok 8: "What shall I say to my mother, Kausalya or to Kaikeyi? How can I talk to my mother
Sumitra, sighing for the sight of her son?"

Shlok 9: "How shall I console Sumitra, trembling and crying out like an osprey, bereft of her
son, if I return to Ayodhya without lakshmana?"

Shlok 10: "How shall I tell Shatrughna and the illustrious Bharata when I return without
Lakshmana, who followed to the forest along with me?"

Shlok 11: "Alas! I should not be able to endure Sumitra's reproaches. I will leave my body
here itself. I do not wish to continue living."

Shlok 12: "Woe unto me to my wicked deed and to my lack of nobility. Through my fault,
Lakshmana has fallen and lies indeed on a bed of arrows as on who has yielded up his life!"

Shlok 13: "O, Lakshmana! You always used to consoe me whenever I was in a great sorrow. You,
having lost your life now are not able to allay my sufferings with your words."

Shlok 14: "You, who in this battle today, struck down inummerable demons to the earth, are
fallen, pierced by darts, like a hero on the self same field."

Shlok 15: "Lying on this bed of arrows, bathed in blood, you are piled up; sharajaalaiH= in a
heap of arrows; saH= you, as such; bhaasi= look; bhaaskaraH= iva= like the sun; vrajan= setting
behind; astam= the horizon.

Shlok 16: "Your vital parts having been pierced with arrows, you are not able even to speak
now. Eventhough you not speaking, your agony is disclosed by the redness of your eyes."

Shlok 17: "I shall follow him to the region of Yama, as that illustrious warrior accompanied
me when I retired to the forest."

Shlok 18: "He who loved his own kinsfolk and was filled iwth devotion for me, got this state
to which my misdeeds have brought him, wretched that I am!"

Shlok 19: "I do not remember to have heard any harsh or hateful words from that valiant
Lakshmana, even if he is deeply provoked."

Shlok 20: "Lakshmana, who was able to loose five hundred arrows in one shot, was surpassing
kartavirya himself in the science of archery."

Shlok 21: "This Lakshmana, who was accustomed to a rich couch and who by his arrows severe the
weapons the mighty Indra the Lord of celestials, is lying slain on the ground."

Shlok 22: "Those vain words uttered by me, will ndoubtedly consume me since I have not made
Vibhishana the king of demons."

Shlok 23: "O, Sugreeva! You ought to return at once from here since knowing that you are
bereft of my support, Ravana will overcome you, O king!"

Shlok 24: "O, Sugreeva! Recross the sea with your army, keeping Angada in front and with your
followers, Nila and Nala."

Shlok 25: "I am fully satisfied by the great military exploit, done by Jambavan the king of
Bears and the General of the Monkeys, which was impossible to any other in battle."

Shlok 26: "A great act was done by Angada, Mainda and Dvivida. A terrible combat was done by
Kesari and Sampati in the battle-field."

Shlok 27: "By Gavaya, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Gaja and other monkeys, who are willing to sacrifice
their lives for me, the battle was carried on."

Shlok 28: "O, Sugreeva! It is not possible for mortals to avoid their destiny. O, Sugreeva the
tormentat of enemies! Fearing to fail in your duty, you have done all that which a friend and a
comrade could do."

Shlok 29: "O. foremost of Monkyes! You have accomplished all this due to your friendship. I
take leave of you all; go where it seems best to you!"

Shlok 30: All the tawny eyed monkeys, who heard Rama's lament thus, allowed tears to fall from
their eyes.

Shlok 31: Meanwhile, Vibhishana having established order in all the ranks, with mace in his
hand, came quickly to Rama.

Shlok 32: Seeing him, who resembled a mass of collyrium, hastening towards them thus, all the
monkeys thinking him to be Indrajit the son of Ravana, fled away.



SARGA 50
------------------------------

[Text] Observing Vibhishana to be the cause of panic created among the monkeys, Sugreeva
asks Jambavan to restore the confidence of monkeys. Jambavan then ressures the monkeys. Vibhishana
also feels distressed on perceiving the bodies of Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious on the
ground. Sugreeva consoles and convinces Ravana that Rama and Lakshmana will regain consiousness.
Meanwhile, Garuda the King of Birds, makes his appearance on the scene and liberates Rama and
Lakshmana from their bondage.

Shlok 1: Meanwhile, Sugreeva the king of Monkeys, possessing a great splendour and a mighty
power, enquired saying, "Why is this army agitated, like a ship driven out of its course in
water?"

Shlok 2- 3: Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Angada the son of Vali replied, saying "Do you not
see the high-souled Rama and Lakshmana of the great chariot, those two valiant sons of Dasaratha
covered with darts lying all bloody in a bed of arrows?"

Shlok 4: Thereupon, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeys said to his son Angada: "To my mind, there
is some othere cause why the monkeys are bewildereed. There must be some danger ahead."

Shlok 5: "Here, these monkeys are runnng away in all directions, with their eyes distended
with terror, throwing down their arms and looking dejected."

Shlok 6: "They are not ashamed of one another. They are not looking behind than even. They
are jostling each other and leaping over those who have fallen."

Shlok 7: In the midst of this turmoil, the valiant Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his hand
came there and cheered Sugreeva and Rama saying "Victory to Rama! Victory to Rama!."

Shlok 8: Observing Vibhishana to be the cause of panic among the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke to
the illustrious Jambavan the king of Bears who stood near (as follows):

Shlok 9: "It is Vibhishana who has come here. On seeing him, the foremost of monkeys seized
with terror have fled, deeming him to be Indrajit, Ravana's son."

Shlok 10: "You reassemble those monkeys immediately, who in fear have scattered in many
directions and inform them that it is Vibhishana who has come!"

Shlok 11: Thus spoken by Sugreeva, Jambavan the king of Bears called the fugitive monkeys back
and restored them to confidence.

Shlok 12: Hearing the words of Jambavan the king of Bears, all those monkeys, on perceiving
Vibhishana, retraced their steps, shaking off their fear.

Shlok 13: Meanwhile, the virtuous Vibhishana, on beholding Rama's body as also of Lakshmana's
covered with arrows, felt distressed.

Shlok 14: Washing their eyes with his hands dipped in water, Vibhishana began to weap, with
anguish seizing his heart and lamented, saying:

Shlok 15: "These two powerful and valiant warrriors have been brought tot his state by the
demons, the treacherous combatants."

Shlok 16: "The son of my brother, that wicked youth of perverse soul in his demoniac cunning
mind, has decived those two honourable fighters."

Shlok 17: "These two warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, who were struck badly by arrows and covered
with blood are lying on the earth, like two porcupines."

Shlok 18: "These two lions among men, on whom depended the positon aspired by me, are lying
insensible, waiting for the dissolution of the body."

Shlok 19: "Deprived of the hope now of becoming a king, I am as one dead, eventhough
surviving; while my rival Ravana sees his vow fulfilled and gets his desires realised."

Shlok 20: Then, Sugreeva the magnanimous King of Monkeys embraced that Vibhishana thus
lamenting and spoke the following words:

Shlok 21: "O, knower of what is right! You shall certainly reign over Lanka. Ravana and his
son will not acheive their purpose."

Shlok 22: "The injury done to Rama and Lakshmana is not grave. Emerging from their swoon, they
will destroy Ravana with his hordes in battles."

Shlok 23: Consoling and convincing Vibhishana thus, Sugreeva spoke to Sushena, his
father-in-law, who was on his side (as follows):

Shlok 24: "Taking these two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana with the troops of monkeys who are
strong, you go to Kishkindha, till these two scourgers of their foes have recovered their
consciousness."

Shlok 25: "As for me, I shall slay Ravana with his son and his relatives and bring back Seetha
as did Indra the Lord of celestials, the prosperity he had lost."

Shlok 26: "Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Sushena replied as followers: " A highly terrific
and great was between celestials and demons was perceived by me."

Shlok 27: "By making themselves invisible again and again, the demons skilled in the use of
arrows overcame the celestials despite their skill in bearing arms."

Shlok 28: "To those celestials who were wounded, unconscious and almost deprived of life,
Brihaspati treated them by the aid of herbs accompanied by his spells of sacred formulas."

Shlok 29: "Let the monkeys Sampati, Panasa and others go quickly in speed, to the ocean of
milk, to bring those herbs."

Shlok 30: "These monkeys are conversant with those efficacious mountianous herbs - the
celestial Sanjivakarani and Vishalya, which were created by a God."

Shlok 31: "In the bosom of the milky ocean the best of oceans, rise the mountains called
Chandra and Drona, where the ambrosia was formerly churned. These two excellent herbs exist
there."

Shlok 32: "The celestials place dthose two mountain in the vast sea. O, King! Let Hanuman the
son of Wind-God go there."

Shlok 33: In the meantime, a great wind arose, accompanied by massed clouds and lightning,
whipping up the salty waves in the ocean, causing the mountains to tremble as from an
earthquake.

Shlok 34: "Large trees on the sand-banks had their branches broken by the mighty stroke of
Vata's wings and fell headlong into the briny waters of the ocean."

Shlok 35: "The snakes became frightened. The snakes inhabiting there and all the marine
animals plunged quickly into the briny ocean."

Shlok 36: Thereupon, all the monkeys saw within a moment, a mighty eagle, Garuda, the son of
Vinata, like unto a blazing torch.

Shlok 37: On beholding Garuda the eagle which came there, the serpants who bound those two
warriors Rama and Lakshmana in the form of mighty arrows, fled away.

Shlok 38: Thereupon, Garuda the eagle, coming into contact iwth Rama and Lakshmana d offering
them his good wishes, with his hands caressly touched their faces that were radiant like the
moon.

Shlok 39: Their wounds, touched by Garuda the eagle, were healed. Their bodies soon became
smooth and well-rounded.

Shlok 40: Their lustre, valour, strength, endurance and resolution, those great qualities,
also their perspicacity, intelligence and memory were re-doubled.

Shlok 41: Lifting them up both who were like Indra, the highly majestic Garuda the eagle
embraced them. Rama also, being pleased, spoke to him (as follows):

Shlok 42: "Now, by your grace, we both have overcome a great disaster created by Indrajit the
son of Ravana. We have been made strong as before."

Shlok 43: "By meeting you thus, my heart is gladdened in the same manner as I am meeting
Dasaratha, my fatehr and Aja, my paternal grandfather."

Shlok 44: "Who are you, the one endowed with beauty, having blissful garlands and anointments,
wearing clean garments and adorned iwth divine ornaments?"

Shlok 45: The highly majestic and the mighty Garuda the eagle, the King of Birds, with his eys
widened in gladness and with a pleased heart, spoke to Rama as follows:

Shlok 46: "O, Rama! I am your dearest friend Garuda dear as your own breath moving outside I
came here for the purpose of helping you, both."

Shlok 47- 48: "Either the most valiant demons or the exceedingly strong monkeys or the celestials
together with the celestial musicians having Devendra the Lord of celestials in their forefront are
unable to untie this awfully terrific entanglement of arrows created through his power of sorcery
by Indrajit of terrific deeds."

Shlok 49: "These serpents, which took their base at, were none other than the sons of Kadru
with their sharp fangs, abundantly filled with poison, transformed into arrows, by the dint of
sorcery by Indrajit the demon."

Shlok 50: "O, Rama the knower of righeousness and true to your promise! You, along with your
brother Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies, indeed are lucky."

Shlok 51: "Hearing about this incident, I have hastened all at once, duly cherishing the love
and friendship (for you)."

Shlok 52: "You have been released from this quite terrific shackle of arrows. Both of you
should maintain vigilance, all the time."

Shlok 53: "All the demons by their very nature are treacherous fighters in battle. For you,
the warriors, your pue-mindedness and straight forwardeness are the strengths."

Shlok 54: "What Indrajit has done, exemplifies how the demons are always crooked-minded. For
this reason, you should not trust the demons in battle."

Shlok 55: That mighty Garuda, having spoken thus to Rama then and having affectionately
embraced him, began to take leave of him.

Shlok 56: "O, Rama the knower of piety, affectionate even towards your enemies and my dear
fried! I wish to take leave of you." I shall proceed happily."

Shlok 57: "O, hero! You need not be so curious to know the casue of my friendship. You will
know of it, once you have accomplished success in battle."

Shlok 58: "When, under the flutter of your arrows, Lanka has been destroyed save for the aged
and the children and you have slain Ravana,. your enemy, you will bring back Seetha."

Shlok 59- 60: Having spoken thus, Garuda of swift flight, having beautiful wings, who had just
healed Rama's wounds in the presence of monkeys, having paid obeisance presence of monkeys, having
paid obeisance to him (by circumambulation) and taken him into his arms, entered the sky with the
speed of the wind.

Shlok 61: Seeing Rama and Lakshmana healed of their wounds, the cheifs of monkeys haowled like
roars of lions and lashed their tails.

Shlok 62: Thereupon, gongs were beaten, drums resounded, and couches were blown amid jumping
in joy of the monkeys as before.

Shlok 63: Some other strong monkeys who use trees as maces in battle, waving their arms and
uprooting hundreds and thousands of various trees, stood there, ready for the battle.

Shlok 64: Uttering great noises, frightning the demons and desirous to fight, the monkeys
reached the gates of Lanka.

Shlok 65: Thereafter, a highly terrible and tumuluous sound arose among the leaders of the
monkeys, as, at the end of summer the roaring of thunder clouds in the mid-night.



SARGA 51
------------------------------

[Text] Hearing the rejoicing cries of the monkeys, Ravana asks some demons to discover the
cause of that rejoicing. The demons mount the rampart and discover that Rama and Lakshmana have
been relieved of the shackle of arrows. They come to Ravana and inform that the two brothers Rama
and Lakshmana are alive and appear like two strong elephants in the battle-field. Ravana then calls
Dhumraksha, a demon and asks him to go with an army and kill Rama, Lakshmana and the monkeys
Dhumraksha along with his army enters the western gate of Lanks where the army-chief Hanuman is
stationed. While Dhumraksha advances in the battle-field, he observes several bad omens and feels
disturbed.

Shlok 1: That tumultuous sound, set up by the monkeys who were full of martial ardour,
arrested the attention of Ravana and his demons.

Shlok 2: Hearing that mighty clamour, sounding smooth and deep, Ravana spoke to his ministers
who surrounded him.

Shlok 3- 4: "A great uproar, resembling the rumbling of clouds, has arisen from that horde of
rejoiced monkeys. Undoubtedly their joy is great, their mighty roars are agitating the briny ocean
itself.

Shlok 5: "Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana were tied by sharp arrows. This sound of a
great magnitude being heard by me, is begetting an apprehension in me."

Shlok 6: Having spoken thus to his ministers, Ravana the Lord of Demons said to his demons
who stood round him there (as follows)

Shlok 7: "You immediately discover from what cause this general rejoicing among all these
monkeys coming for the their present grievous situation!'

Shlok 8- 9: Thus commanded by Ravana, they mounted the rampart very briskly and saw the army
lead by the high-souled Sugreeva and also the highly fortunate Rama and Lakshmana who were relieved
of the terrific shackle of arrow a and risen up together. All the demons felt desponded on seeing
it.

Shlok 10: With their hearts trembling with fear and faces turning pale, all those terrific
demons descended from the rampart and approached Ravana.

Shlok 11: With downcast faces, those demons skilled in speech, faithfully informed Ravana of
those unpleasant tidings, saying:

Shlok 12- 13: "The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, whom Indrajit had bound with his benumbing
shafts and whose arms he had pinioned, are free from the arrows which paralyzed them and now appear
on the field of battle, as two strong elephants who have snapped their fetters."

Shlok 14: Hearing their words, the might Ravana was filled with anxiety and fury. His face
became pale (and he spoke as follows):

Shlok 15- 16: "If my adversaries, having thus been bound by Indrajit are freed, despite their
injuries in battle by his formidable arrows which were infallible those rare boons, resembling
serpents, bright as the sun, I perceive my entire army in jeopardy."

Shlok 17: "Those very arrows, bright as fire, which in battle have taken the life of my
enemies, have now been rendered void indeed!"

Shlok 18: Having spoken thus in furious tones, hissing like a snake, he addressed a demon
called Dhumraksha who was seated amidst the demons and said.

Shlok 19: "You, with a terrific prowess, go quickly with a considerable force of demons and
slay Rama, Lakshmana and his monkeys."

Shlok 20: Thus commanded by Ravana, the intelligent Dhumraksha, going past from there, quickly
departed front her royal palace.

Shlok 21: Having crossed that gate, he spoke to the General of the Forces as follows:
"Mobilize the army. Hasten quickly. What need is there for the delay?"

Shlok 22: Hearing the words of Dhumraksha, the general of forces, having the army which
followed him, kept the army ready quickly, as per Ravana's command.

Shlok 23: Those strong demons of terrific form, making sounds with bells hung on their bodies,
joyously surrounded Dhumraksha.

Shlok 24- 25: Furnished with every kind of weapon, brandishing spears, hammers, maces, harpoons,
sticks, iron cudgels, bars, clubs, javelins, missiles, nooses and axes, those terrible demons
sallied forth with the noise of thunder.

Shlok 26- 27: Clad in mail, mounted on chariots that were magnificently dressed with flags and
decorated with bands of pure gold, harnessed to mules of many heads or steeds of exceeding
fleetness or elephants in furious rut, some other excellent demons went forth like veritable
tigers.

Shlok 28: Dhumraksha, with a mule-like clatter, set out in a celestial chariot to which mules
adorned with gold and heads of deer and lions were hitched.

Shlok 29: That Dhumraksha of mighty prowess, surrounded by demons, set forth amidst mocking
laughter, through the western gate where the army-chief Hanuman was stationed.

Shlok 30: As he mounted and advanced in an excellent chariot harnessed to mules, whose voices
he emulated, birds of ill-omen in the sky obstructed that advancing demon of very terrible and
fearful appearance.

Shlok 31: A highly terrible vulture alighted on the top of his chariot, while those devourers
of corpses clustered on the point of his standard.

Shlok 32- 33: Streming with blood, a huge decapitated trunk fell to earth, emitting inarticulate
noise in Dhumraksha's vicinity and the sky rained down blood. The earth trembled.

Shlok 34: The wind with noise resembling a thunder blew adversely. Every quarter, obscured by
abundant darkness, did not dazzle.

Shlok 35: Seeing those terrible amones that appeared in all their horror to the demons,
Dhumraksha became perturbed. Terror seized all the demons who were advancing in front of
Dhumraksha.

Shlok 36: Then, Dhumraksha, the highly terrible and strong demon, surrounded by a multitude of
demons, eager to enter into combat, set out and beheld that army of a multitude of monkeys,
resembling a flood, protected by the arms of Rama.



SARGA 52
------------------------------

[Text] Dhumraksha along with army attacks the monkeys. A tumultuous battle ensued between
the demons and the monkeys. The battle reached frightful proportions in that both the monkeys and
demons were killed in large numbers. When Dhumraksha pounced on Hanuman, the latter shattered
Dhumraksha's chariot to pieces. Lifting his mace, Dhumraksha fights with Hanuman, who in turn hits
him on his head and kills him.

Shlok 1: Beholding the demon, Dhumraksha of terrible prowess coming forth, all the monkeys
waiting for the war, roared with joy.

Shlok 2: A highly tumultuous battle was seen between those monkeys and demons, who were
slaying each other, with terrible trees, lances and maces.

Shlok 3: The terrible monkeys were moved down on all sides by the demons. The demon too were
levelled down to the earth with trees by the monkeys.

Shlok 4: Enraged with anger, the demons, on their part, paralyzed the monkeys with sharp and
frightful arrows, going as straight as wings of eagle.

Shlok 5- 6: While being torn asunder by the demons with terrible maces, spears, hammers,
frightful iron bars and variegated tridents, the mighty monkeys fearlessly accomplished their tasks
with an excitement born of anger.

Shlok 7: While their bodies were split up by the tridents and their limbs broken by arrows,
those leaders of monkeys took up trees and rocks there to fight.

Shlok 8: Those terribly swift monkeys, roaring aloud harassed the valiant demons at all
places, by calling out their names.

Shlok 9: That awful battle with all kinds of rocks and trees furnished with many branches
between monkeys and demons appeared wonderful.

Shlok 10: Some demons were crushed by monkeys, who conquered fear and some blood-sucking
demons vomited blood from their mouths.

Shlok 11: Some demons were slashed open at their sides. Some were formed into a heap by the
trees. Some others were crushed by stones and yet others torn to pieces by the monkeys teeth.

Shlok 12: With their standards crushed and broken, their swords snapped and their chariots
overturned, some demons were perturbed.

Shlok 13: Crushed by the great rocks of monkeys, the earth was scattered with corpses of great
elephants resembling hills and horses with their riders.

Shlok 14: The monkeys of terrific prowess rushed upon the demons, flinging themselves upon
them with great bounds horizontically and vertically and scratching their faces with their sharp
nails.

Shlok 15: With their faces dejected very much, their hair torn out and maddened by the smell
of blood, those demons fell on the ground.

Shlok 16: Some other demons of exceeding valour, who were enraged, very much, ran up towards
the monkeys to attack them with their palms having a diamond-like blow.

Shlok 17: The monkeys, receiving that sharp shock, with even a greater ferocity, crushed the
demons with blows of their fists, feet teeth and trees.

Shlok 18: Seeing his army routed, Dhumraksha that lion among the demons, in his anger began to
create a blood-shed of the monkeys wishing to fight.

Shlok 19: Some monkeys pierced with spears lost rivers of blood while others struck down by
blows of axe, fell to the earth's surface.

Shlok 20: Some were crushed by iron bars, others torn by harpoons, some others pierced by
javelins, all exhausted and lost their lives.

Shlok 21: Slain in battle by infuriated demons, some monkeys, drenched with blood, fell on the
ground and some others disappeared, having been driven away.

Shlok 22: With pierced hearts, some monkeys were made to lie down on one side. Some were torn
asunder by tridents that even their intestines came out.

Shlok 23: That mighty battle assumed most awful proportions in that monkeys and demons were
crammed with rocks, trees and multitude of weapons.

Shlok 24: With the bow-strings as the tuneful lute, the neighing of horses as a measure rhythm
and the trumpeting of elephants as the vocal music, the whole battle resembled a symphony.

Shlok 25: Dhumraksha on his part, wielding a bow in his hand and laughing at the battle-front,
made those monkeys to run away to all the quarters by a shower of his arrows.

Shlok 26: Seeing the army perturbed due to tormented by Dhumraksha, Hanuman was enraged and
turned towards him, taking a gigantic rock in his hands.

Shlok 27: Hanuman, who was equal in strength to his father, with his eyes inflamed with anger,
flung the rock on the chariot of Dhumraksha.

Shlok 28: Beholding the befalling rock, Dhumraksha lifting his mace hurriedly, jumped down
speedily from the chariot and stood there on the earth.

Shlok 29: Shattering his chariot with its wheels, its pole, its crest along with banner and
bows, that rock rolled down to the ground.

Shlok 30: Thereafter, Hanuman the son of Maruta (the wind-god), after breaking the chariot,
destroyed the demons with trunks of trees furnished with their branches.

Shlok 31: With their heads crushed, the demons were drenched with blood. Some others were
crunched by the trees and fell down to the earth.

Shlok 32: Having driven away the army of demons, Hanuma born of Maruta, breaking off the peak
of a mountain, ran towards Dhumraksha.

Shlok 33: The valiant Dhumraksha lifted his mace and making a roaring sound, ran towards that
Hanuman who was rushing on him suddenly.

Shlok 34: Thereafter, Dhumraksha with an outrage, brought down that mace studded with
countless spikes on the head of that Hanuma.

Shlok 35: That Hanuman, who was endowed with an energy similar to the wind, was in no way
disturbed by that blow but struck Dhumraksha on the middle of his skull with his rocky peak.

Shlok 36: That Dhumraksha, struck by the rocky peak, which shattered all his limbs, soon fell
down on the ground like a mountain crumbling.

Shlok 37: Seeing Dhumraksha having been killed, the demons left surviving were frightened of
being killled by the monkeys and re entered Lanka.

Shlok 38: That illustrious Hanuman the son of Pavana having destroyed his enemies, causing
rivers of blood to flow, weary of slaughter of the enemies, with delight, received the cordial
felicitations by the monkeys.

[Text] Ravana sends Vajradamstra, another demon to kill Rama, Sugreeva and his monkeys.
Vajradamstra and his army emerge from the southern gate where Angada, the General of the Monkeys is
stationed. The monkeys had a tough fight with the demons. Angada, the leader of the monkeys strikes
the terrible strong demons, chopping off their heads.

Shlok 1- 2: Hearing the death of Dhumraksha, Ravana the King of demons was possessed of anger
and began to hiss like a serpent. Polluted by anger, with long and burning sighs, he addressed the
cruel and mighty Vajradamshtra, a demon (as follows)

Shlok 3: "O, warrior! Go ahead as the head of the demons and slay Rama the son of Dasaratha,
as also Sugreeva and his monkeys!"

Shlok 4- 5: "So it be" answered the leader of the demons who was a conjurer and departed with
many divisions of the army that surrounded him. With the utmost attention, he assembled teams of
elephants, horses mules camels and chariots adorning them with conspicuous flags and banners and he
himself was well-prepared.

Shlok 6: Adorned with colourful bracelets and a diadem, Vajradamshtra set out immediately,
wielding a bow and well-covered by an armour.

Shlok 7: That army-general circumambulated and ascended his chariot, duly decorated with
flags and shiningly adorned with purpose.

Shlok 8- 9: Infantry of every kind issued forth, furnished in their hands with weapons such as
clubs, excellent javelins, smooth pestles, harpoons, bows, lances, spears, swords, discus, maces
and sharp axes.

Shlok 10: All those excellent demons in their resplendent and coloured uniforms, full of
strength and mounted on elephants furious with rut, resembled moving mountains.

Shlok 11: All those excellent demons in their resplendent and coloured uniforms, full of
strength and mounted on elephants furious with rut, resembled moving mountains.

Shlok 12: That whole army of demons paraded, looking as brilliant as the clouds, with
lightning and sound in the rainy season. They emerged from the southern gate where the General
Angada is stationed.

Shlok 13- 14: While those demons set forth, inauspicious portents appeared. From a cloudless yet
burning sky, meteors fell. Fearful jackals, emitting their howls, belched forth flames and
fire.

Shlok 15: The dreadful beasts then foretold destruction of demons, who while entering the
combat, stumbled miserably.

Shlok 16: Ever after seeing these portents Vajradamshtra of exceeding prowess and sharpness,
shored up courage and being fond of battle, set out for the combat.

Shlok 17: The monkeys, burning for victory, seeing their enemies advancing, made tremendous
shouts which echoed every quarter.

Shlok 18: Thereafter, a tumultuous battle ensured between the monkeys and the demons, who were
cruel, of ferocious form and desirous of each other's destruction.

Shlok 19: Some warriors of great energy, coming for war, their necks, and bodies severed, fell
to the surface of the earth, their entire bodies bathed in blood.

Shlok 20: Some other warriors, who did not turn back in battle, with arms resembling steel,
approached one another, attacking with various kinds of weapons.

Shlok 21: An extremely great and terrible noise, breaking the hearts, was heard there from
trees, rocks and weapons.

Shlok 22: A terrific noise of the wheel-rims of chariots and the bow, along with the
tumultuous sounds of couches, kettle-drums and tabours arose there.

Shlok 23- 24: Some demons, leaving weapons, performed battle with their arms. The demons were
beaten and their bodies made fragmented by the monkeys of fighting arrogance, with their palms,
feet, fists, trees and knees. Some demons were crushed to powder with rocks.

Shlok 25: Tremendously frightening the monkeys in the battle by his arrows, Vajradamshtra
moved himself in the battle-field like Yama the God of Death moving at the time of dissolution of
the worlds, wielding a noose in his hand.

Shlok 26: The strong demons skilled in weaponry and wielding various kinds of weapons, killed
the army of monkeys in that battle, with their increased anger.

Shlok 27: The courageous Angada the son of Vali, twice possessed of anger, killed all those
demons in the battle, like a world-destroying fire.

Shlok 28- 29: The valiant Angada with his raging red eyes lifted a tree and killed all those troop
of demons, like a lion killing small animals. Angada, with his prowess resembling that of Indra the
Lord of celestials, brought about a terrific destroyer of the enemies.

Shlok 30: The terribly strong demons, struck by Angada there, had their heads shattered and
fell down like chopped off trees.

Shlok 31: The earth then appeared fearful, it being covered with chariots, conspicuous flags,
horses, bodies of monkeys and demons with streams of blood flowing there.

Shlok 32: That battle-field, decorated with necklaces, bracelets worn on upper arm, garments
and umbrellas looked like an autumnal night.

Shlok 33: By the swiftness of Angada, that great army of demons there trembled then, like a
cloud by the swiftness of wind.



SARGA 54
------------------------------

[Text] The powerful demon Vajradamshtra penetrated the army of monkeys, sowing terror among
them. The monkeys then sought refuge with Angada the monkey-leader. A fierce battle ensues between
Vajradamshtra and Angada. Angada assaults Vajradamshtra with a sword and Vajradamshtra's head falls
on the ground.

Shlok 1: The devastation of his army through Angada's prowess filled the mighty Vajradamstra
with anger.

Shlok 2: Stretching his terrific bow, like unto Indra's thunder bolt, he assailed the monkey
battalions with a flood of arrows.

Shlok 3: Then, the foremost of the demons mounted on chariots, fought the battle with every
kind of weapon.

Shlok 4: The monkeys, those valiant bulls among the Plavagas, assembling on all sides, fought
with rocks.

Shlok 5: Then in that battle there, the demons abundantly hurled thousands of weapons on the
foremost of monkeys.

Shlok 6: The monkeys of mighty prowess, resembling elephants in rut, showered down giant
trees and huge lumps of rock on the demons.

Shlok 7: Between those courageous warriors, the demons and the monkeys, who never retreated
in battle, a tremendous struggle ensued.

Shlok 8- 9: Some monkeys and demons, with their shattered heads, but bereft of arms and legs,
lay on the earth bathed in blood with their bodies wounded by weapons, a prey to herons vultures
and crows or devoured by troops of jackals.

Shlok 10: Monkeys and demons fell on the battle-field; headless trunks leaps up to the terror
of all the fearful, their limbs hacked to pieces in the combat.

Shlok 11: Thereafter, under the eyes of Vajradamshtra, all his army of demons were killed and
broken up by the monkey-troops.

Shlok 12- 13: Seeing the demons terrified with fear and decimated by the monkeys, that powerful
Vajradamshtra, his eyes red with anger, bow in hand, penetrated the army of monkeys, sowing panic
among them.

Shlok 14: Thereafter, in his fury, the vigorous Vajradamshtra dispatched those monkeys with
arrows resembling wings of an eagle that flew straight to their target and pierced seven, eight,
nine or five of his opponents simultaneously, thus destroying them.

Shlok 15: With their limbs crippled by those arrows and frightened, those monkey battalions
sought refuge with Angada, as all creatures with Brahma the Lord of Creation.

Shlok 16: When he beheld those monkey troops fleeing in disorder, Angada the son Vali
exchanged glances of hatred with Vajradamshtra.

Shlok 17: Both Vajradamshtra and Angada fought against each other like a lion and an elephant
in rut. They strolled din a tremendous fury.

Shlok 18: Thereafter, that Vajradamshtra knocked the mighty Angada at his vital organs with
his arrows resembling hundred thousand flames of fire.

Shlok 19: With all his limbs drenched in blood, the mighty Angada having a terrific prowess
threw a tree on Vajradamshtra.

Shlok 20: That unperplexed demon, seeing that tree falling on him, cut it into innumerable
pieces which fell in heaps on earth.

Shlok 21: Witnessing the strength of Vajradamshtra, Angada that lion among the monkeys seized
hold of a large rock and emitting a shout, threw it on him.

Shlok 22: As the rock descended, that vigorous Vajradamshtra leaping down from his chariot,
armed with his mace, stood waiting unperplexed, on the battle-field.

Shlok 23: Meanwhile, the rock thrown by Angada, falling into the forefront of the battle, then
crushed the chariot with its wheels shafts and horses

Shlok 24: Thereafter, Angada the monkey, seizing another large peak of a mountain adorned with
trees, threw it on Vajradamshtra's head.

Shlok 25: Beginning to vomit blood, Vajradamshtra became fainted, clenching his mace
convulsively and breathing heavily for a moment.

Shlok 26: Regaining his consciousness, Vajradamshtra the demon was very much enraged and hit
Angada full on the chest with his mace.

Shlok 27: Leaving his mace, he performed a pugilistic encounter there. Both the monkey and the
demon thus hit each other in that combat.

Shlok 28: Exhausted by the blows, spitting blood, those valiant warriors were like the planets
Mars and Mercury.

Shlok 29: Then, Angada the lion among the monkeys, possessing a great splendour, uprooted a
tree full with many flowers and fruits and stood waiting.

Shlok 30: The demon too seized hold of a shield covered with the hide of a bull as well as a
great beautiful sword decorated richly with a multitude of golden bells.

Shlok 31: Thirsting for victory, the monkeys and the demons, making roaring sounds, roamed
about in different ways and collided with each other.

Shlok 32: With their gaping wounds, they shone like a pair of kimshuka trees in blossom.
Exhausted were both of them while fighting and they sank their knees on the earth.

Shlok 33: Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, just after a moment, with his glittering eyes,
rose up like a serpent struck with a stick.

Shlok 34: The mighty Angada assaulted the giant head of Vajradamshtra with a well-sharpened
and stainless sword.

Shlok 35: Struck by the sword, that charming head of Vajradamshtra, with his limbs drenched in
blood and eyes rolling, fell into two pieces.

Shlok 36- 37: Seeing Vajradamshtra having been slain, the demons, deluded with fear, fled
panic-stricken towards Lanka, harassed by the monkeys with their down-cast faces, their heads bowed
in shame.

Shlok 38: The mighty Angada experienced a great joy amidst the monkey forces, honoured by them
for his high courage and he resembled the Lord of a Thousand Eyes surrounded by the celestials.

[Text] Ravana next sends Akampana for the battle. As Akampana along with his army sets out
for the war, he visualized various bad portents. A deadly conflict ensued between monkeys and
demons. Kumuda, Nala and Mainda the chiefs of monkeys creates a great carnage among demons.

Shlok 1: Hearing that Vajradamshtra was killed by Angada, Ravana spoke the following words to
the General of his forces who, with joined palms, stood near him.

Shlok 2: "Let the invincible demons of irresistible courage go forth soon, with Akampana as
their head, who is skilled in the use of every weapon and missile."

Shlok 3: "This excellent demon is a chastiser, a protector and a leader in battle. He ever
desired my welfare and always loved war."

Shlok 4: "There is no doubt that he will prove victorious and Rama, Lakshmana, the mighty
Sugreeva and the other terrible monkeys."

Shlok 5: Taking that command of Ravana, the mighty Akampana of quick resolution then
mobilized the army.

Shlok 6: Those foremost of demons of terrifying appearance, furnished with every kind of
weapon and fearful to look upon, rushed into the fray where their general had dispatched them.

Shlok 7: Then, Akampana of the stature and colour of a cloud, whose voice resembled a
thunder, ascended his great chariot, decorated with fine gold and set out, surrounded by dreadful
demons.

Shlok 8: Even celestials were indeed unable to upset Akampana in a great battle. Hence, among
the demons, he was shining like the sun, by his splendour.

Shlok 9: As he sped on his way, hastened and eager to enter the battle, the horses drawing
his chariot were suddenly deprived of their energy.

Shlok 10: The left eye of Akampana, who delighted in warfare, began to twitch. His countenance
grew pale and his voice trembled.

Shlok 11: At a time of a good day, marked by fine weather, it turned into a day of bad weather
with a bitter wind beginning to blow. Birds and beasts uttered cruel and fearful cries.

Shlok 12: That demon, who had the shoulders of a lion and the agility of a tiger, disregarding
those portents, rushed towards the battle-field.

Shlok 13: While Akampana advanced thus with his troops, an immense tumult arose that seemed to
convulse the ocean.

Shlok 14: By hearing that clamour of the demons coming for the battle, the huge army of the
monkeys, brandishing trees and rocks, was frightened.

Shlok 15: A highly fierce battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were ready to
lose their lives for the sake of Rama and Ravana.

Shlok 16: All the monkeys and demons, who were willing to kill each other, were very strong
and valiant. All were resembling mountains.

Shlok 17: The tremendous clamour of the aforesaid warriors, yelling in their rage and
strength, making savage cries, were distinctly heard on the battle-field.

Shlok 18: A highly terrific dust, in a thick coppery colour, raised by the monkeys and demons
enveloped all the ten quarters.

Shlok 19: The combatants, enveloped by that dust, which was whitish like a piece of silk
shaken by the wind, could no longer distinguish each other on the battle-field.

Shlok 20: Neither standard, banner and shield, nor horse, weapon and chariot could be
discerned in that pall of dust.

Shlok 21: A great tumultuous clamour, of warriors, making challenging cries and rushing upon
each other, was heard on the battle-field, yet in that confusion, no form was visible.

Shlok 22: In the darkness, the greatly enraged monkeys killed the monkeys themselves and the
demons killed the demons themselves in battle.

Shlok 23: Those monkeys and demons killing other and their own people then made the earth
dampened with blood, anointing its body with mud.

Shlok 24: Under the stream of blood being sprinkled, the dust was laid, revealing the earth
covered with bodies and corpses.

Shlok 25: The demons and the monkeys vigorously struck each other swiftly with blows from
trees, spears, maces, javelins, stones, bars and picks.

Shlok 26: The monkeys of dreadful deeds, resembling mountains, fighting with their arms
appearing like iron bars, killed the demons in battle.

Shlok 27: The enraged demons with darts and javelins in their hands, struck the monkeys there
with their cruel weapons.

Shlok 28: The extremely enraged Akampana, the general of the army of demons, cheered all those
demons by his terrible prowess.

Shlok 29: The monkeys however leaping upon them and snatching their weapons through their
strength, crushed those demons with blows from large trees and stones.

Shlok 30: Meanwhile Kumuda, Nala and Mainda the courageous monkeys in an outburst of anger,
displayed unsuprassed rashness.

Shlok 31- 32: Those exceedingly valiant chiefs of monkeys, as in sport, in the battle-front, with
mighty blows of trees, created a great carnage among the demons. All of them repeatedly crushed the
demons with every kind of weapon.



SARGA 56
------------------------------

[Text] Akampana enters the battle-field and assails the monkeys with his bow and arrows.
Then, Hanuman comes to the rescue of the monkeys. A great fight ensued between Akampana and
Hanuman. Hanuman strikes the head of Akampana with a huge tree and Akampana dies. All the demons
take to their heels and return to Lanka.

Shlok 1: Seeing that very great exploit executed by the chiefs of monkeys in the battle,
Akampana was seized with a fierce anger.

Shlok 2: Witnessing that work of the enemies, his features were distorted by anger and
brandishing his powerful bow, Akampana addressed his charioteer in these words.

Shlok 3: "Drive the chariot quickly to that place, for, those monkeys are killing innumerable
demons on the battle field."

Shlok 4: "Those arrogant monkeys of terrific ferocity, armed with trees and rocks, dare to
affront me here."

Shlok 5: "I wish to kill those andicious monkeys, who are seen herassing all the army of
demons."

Shlok 6: Thereafter, in his chariot, drawn by fast-moving horses, Akampana the most skillful
of chariot-warriors, with a hail of darts, assailed the monkeys from a distance.

Shlok 7: The monkeys were no longer able to maintain their formation, much less fight in the
battle. all of them were crushed under the shifts of Akampana and took to their heels.

Shlok 8: Seeing those companions, getting under the sway of death pursued by Akampana's
darts, the mighty Hanuman went to their rescue.

Shlok 9: Seeing Hanuman their great leader, all those valiant and the best of the monkeys
together rallied and grouped themselves boldly round him.

Shlok 10: Observing Hanuman's courage, those excellent monkeys took shelter in his
powerfulness and became powerfulness and became powerful indeed.

Shlok 11: Akampana, like Mahendra the Lord of celestials, assailed a hail of arrows on
Hanuman, who remained as firm as a rock.

Shlok 12: Heedless of the flood of weapons that fell upon his body, the mighty Hanuman
resolved in his mind to slay Akampana.

Shlok 13: Laughing heartily , that Hanuman, the son of Maruta the wind-god and possessing a
great splendour, leapt on the demon, causing the earth to shake as it were.

Shlok 14: As he roared burning with energy, the form of Hanuman became difficult to overpower,
like a blazing fire.

Shlok 15: Knowing himself to be bereft of any weapon, Hanuman the excellent monkey, with a
rage, uplifted a mountain quickly.

Shlok 16: That valiant Hanuman, seizing a very great mountain with one hand and letting up a
roar, began to spin it rapidly.

Shlok 17: Thereafter, as formerly in an encounter Indra the Lord of celestials hurled his
thunderbolt at Namuchi, Hanuman rushed towards Akampana.

Shlok 18: Beholding that crag flying towards him, Akampana shattered it even from a distance
by means of his great crescent-shaped arrows.

Shlok 19: Seeing that rocky peak shatterd in the air by the demon's arrows and falling in
pieces, Hanuman became mad with anger.

Shlok 20: Approaching an Ashwakarna tree as large as a mountain, in the transport of rage that
possessed him, that Hanuman uprooted it speedily.

Shlok 21: Taking hold of that Ashvakarna tree with large branches, in his great strength,
Hanuman with immense delight spinned it, while standing on the ground.

Shlok 22: Then, the highly enraged Hanuman began to run with great strides, breaking down the
trees by his strength and tearing up the earth with his feet.

Shlok 23: Hanuman struck down elephants as also who rode upon them and charioteers with their
chariots and the terrific infantry of demons.

Shlok 24: Seeing that Hanuman, like unto Yama the Destroyer of vital Breaths, full of wrath
armed with a tree and taking off lives, the demons took of flight.

Shlok 25: The valiant Akampana, beholding that Hanuman who was enraged and rushing on, sowing
terror among his soldiers, was greatly perturbed and set up a mighty shout.

Shlok 26: With fourteen sharp arrows that tore the flesh, that Akampana pierced the highly
valiant Hanuman.

Shlok 27: Riddled with sharp-pointed shafts, that warrior Hanuman appeared like a mountain on
which a number of plants shooted up.

Shlok 28: That mighty Hanuman of great strength with a large body shone like a fire without
smoke and resembled a blooming Ashoka tree.

Shlok 29: Thereafter, showing a great haste in uprooting another tree, Hanuman struck the head
of Akampana the General of demons.

Shlok 30: Struck with a tree by that high-souled and enraged Hanuman, that demon fell down and
died.

Shlok 31: Seeing their leader Akampana lying lifeless on earth, all the demons trembled as the
trees do during an earthquake.

Shlok 32: All those defeated warriors, throwing their arms, escaped in the direction of Lanka,
terrified, pursued by those monkeys.

Shlok 33: Their hair loosened, bewildered, their pride broken by defeat, their limbs dripping
with sweat, those demons fled, blowing out their breaths.

Shlok 34: Mad with fear, looking back again and again and crushing each other in haste, they
entered the city.

Shlok 35: When those demons had entered Lanka, all the mighty monkeys approached Hanuman and
paid homage to him.

Shlok 36: That Hanuman, of noble nature honoured all those delighted monkeys, in accord with
their rank and the occasion.

Shlok 37: The triumphant monkeys shouted in accord with their nighty and once again dragged
the demons who were still alive there on the battle-field.

Shlok 38: That great monkey, born of Maruta having encountered and killed the demons, enjoyed
the same renown as Vishnu when he overcame the mighty and terrific demon of immense power
destroying his enemies in the forefront of the battle.

Shlok 39: Then, the troops of deities along with Rama himself, the exceedingly strong
Lakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys and the mighty Vibhishana paid homage to Hanuman.



SARGA 57
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana asks Prahasta to go to the battle. Prahasta sets out for the combat along
with a huge army and enters the eastern gate. Bad omens appeared, as Prahasta enters the
battle-field. The army of monkeys seized hold of trees and rocks, to attack the demons.

Shlok 1: Hearing of Akampana's killing, Ravana the Lord of demons, with a little depressed
face, was enraged and looked towards his ministers.

Shlok 2: Having reflected awhile and deliberated with his ministers, Ravana the king of
Demons then passed that forenoon in inspecting his defenses in the City of Lanka.

Shlok 3: The king Ravana saw that City, guarded by groups of demons, filled with innumerable
troops and decorated with banners and flags.

Shlok 4: Seeing Lanka besieged, Ravana the Lord of Demons spoke as follows to Prahasta who
was skilled in war-fare and who wished well of him even at a critical time.

Shlok 5: "O, Prahasta the proficient in war-free! I do not see any other deliverance than a
battle for this city, which is besieged suddenly and being devastated."

Shlok 6: "Either myself or Kumbhakarna or yourself my army-chief or Indrajit or Nikumbha and
none else could undertake such a task!"

Shlok 7: "For that reason, taking a company of warriors, you quickly place yourself in their
midst and set forth in order to triumph over all those monkeys."

Shlok 8: "Unsettled in no time on knowing your decision to enter the battle-field, the army
of monkeys will run away on hearing the raring sound of the leaders of demons."

Shlok 9: "The monkeys are unsteady, mis-behaved and fickle-minded. They do not tolerate your
sound, as elephants the lion's roar."

Shlok 10: "O, Prahasta! As that army takes to its heels, Rama along with Lakshmana being
supportless, will fall into your power though unwillingly."

Shlok 11: "A skeptical misfortune is preferable to one that is certain! Whether it is
unpleasing to hear or not, say what you consider as an advantage to us."

Shlok 12: Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta the Army-General spoke the following words to
Ravana, like Ushana the preceptor of demons would speak to Bali, the king of demons.

Shlok 13: O, king! Formerly, we deliberated this matter with our wise ministers and, after
having a good dialogue with each other, a disagreement arose between us."

Shlok 14: "To return Seetha was what I considered preferable. Not to do so meant war; we
foresaw this."

Shlok 15: "I have ever been honoured by you at appropriate times by gifts, felicitations and
nice words. When the opportunity arises, is it not for me to render you a service?"

Shlok 16: "Neither wives nor sons nor riches are going to be spared by me. See you me,
intending to sacrifice my life for your sake in the battle."

Shlok 17: Having spoken thus to Lord Ravana, the General Prahasta said to his leading officers
who stood before him as follows:

Shlok 18- 19: "Gather a large army of demons together for me. Today, the flesh-eating birds and
beasts shall feed on the enemy that I strike down on the battle-field with my swift arrows."

Shlok 20: Hearing that command of Prahasta, the mighty leaders of the army assembled the
forces in the abode of that demon.

Shlok 21: Within a short while, that City of Lanka was filled with those terrific
demon-warriors, resembling elephants and wielding various types of weaponry.

Shlok 22: While some demons propitiated the fire-god with their offerings and paid homage to
Brahmanas, a fragrant freeze bearing the scent of clarified butter, began to blow.

Shlok 23: Then, the demons who were ready for the battle, delightedly wore garlands of
different shapes, consecrated by certain Mantras (sacred formulas).

Shlok 24: Thereafter, armed with bows and armours, the demons with their eyes turned towards
their king Ravana, marched at a brisk pace and ranged themselves round Prahasta.

Shlok 25- 26- 27: Then, Prahasta who got ready with his weapons and armour, after bidding obeisance to
the king and striking a terrible kettle-drum, mounted his chariot, which was kept ready, yoked to
an extremely swift horses, well controlled by a charioteer, emanating a noise resembling that of a
large cloud, actually shining like moon-light, inviolable with a flag bearing an ensign of snake,
with a good collision-guard, with nice wheels and decorated with a net of pure gold smiling as it
were in its magnificence.

Shlok 28: Then, Prahasta the one who was commanded by Ravana, ascended his chariot and set out
from Lanka soon along with a huge army.

Shlok 29: While Prahasta the general sallied forth, the sound of a kettle-drum, the resonance
of musical instruments and the sound of conches were heard, as though filling the earth like the
roar of a cloud.

Shlok 30: The demons with terrific forms and bulky bodies, shouting with dreadful voices, went
in front, as forerunners of Prahasta.

Shlok 31: Narantaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata, attendants of Prahasta sallied forth,
surrounding him on all sides.

Shlok 32: He emerged from the eastern gate in the midst of an immense, formidable and orderly
arranged army, resembling a herd of elephants.

Shlok 33: In the centre of that army, vast as the sea, that Prahasta in his fury, came forth
appearing like Death at the end of the world.

Shlok 34: The uproar that arose on his setting forth with his demons raising the war-cries
drew sinister answering calls from all creatures in Lanka.

Shlok 35: In a cloudless sky, birds of prey eating flesh and blood, flew in circles from left
to right towards the chariot.

Shlok 36: Fearful jackals vomited forth fire and flames, howling repeatedly. A meteor fell
from the sky and the wind blew harshly.

Shlok 37- 38: The plants, in opposition to each other, lost their brilliance. The clouds, with
their raucous sound, showered blood on Prahasta's chariot and dampened those who were walking in
front of it.

Shlok 39: A vulture facing the south alighted on the top of the standard, croaking towards
both of its sides and deprived the demon of his entire lustre.

Shlok 40: The goad fell several times then from the hand of the charioteer, himself a Suta
(the son of a Kshatriya by a Brahamana woman) eventhough skilled in controlling the horses, as he
entered the battle-field.

Shlok 41: That rarely splendour which clothed Prahasta at the time of his exit vanished in an
instant and horses stumbled on the even ground.

Shlok 42: Beholding that Prahasta, renowned for his excellences and martial valour; as he
advanced to give battle, the army of monkeys went forward to attack him.

Shlok 43: Thereafter, an exceedingly tumultuous clamour arose among the monkeys as they tore
up the trees and seized hold of huge rocks.

Shlok 44- 45: Both the armies of the yelling demons and the roaring monkeys were delighted,
impetuous and powerful with impatience to slay each other and challenging each other with great
shouts.

Shlok 46: Thereafter, the evil-minded Prahasta sallied forth for victory towards the army of
Sugreeva, whom in his folly, imagined he would destroy, with an accelerated speed as a grass-hopper
rushes towards a flame.



SARGA 58
------------------------------

[Text] On Rama's enquiry, Vibhishana explains the prowess of Prahasta who entered the
battle-field. The demons with their arrows and the monkeys with their stones combat each other.
Both the monkeys and demons were killed in the battle. Prahasta the demon and Nila the monkey come
face to face to fight. Prahasta hurls a volley of darts over Nila. Nila kills Prahasta's horses by
hurling a huge tree and breaks his bow. Finally a huge rock hurled by Nila breaks Prahasta's head
into myriad pieces and dies. All the other demons abandon the battle-field and return to Lanka.

Shlok 1: Seeing Prahasta setting out with a martial ardour, Rama the conqueror of enemies,
smiling, spoke to Vibhishana as follows:

Shlok 2: "Who is he with a very huge body, coming with a great speed along with a large army?
O, the mighty armed! Tell me about this strong demon."

Shlok 3- 4: Hearing Rama's words, Vibhishana replied as follows "He is guarded by two-thirds of
the army of Lanka. He is a demon of prowess, skilled in the use of mystic weapons and valiant. He
is the demon named Prahasta, the Army general of Ravana."

Shlok 5- 6: That huge and powerful army of monkeys, who began to emit cries of defiance with
fury, thereupon saw the terrible Prahasta of formidable exploits coming forth towards them.

Shlok 7- 8: Swords, lances, daggers, darts, spears, clubs, maces bars, barbed missiles, various
kinds of axes and different bows glittered in the hands of demons, who were running up towards the
monkeys and seeking victory.

Shlok 9: The monkeys who were burning to fight took hold of trees in flower, rocks and lofty
and thick stones.

Shlok 10: As they approached each other, a very great battle arose between those combatants
who showered down a hail of arrows and a bombardment of stones.

Shlok 11: In that battle, many of the demons killed several excellent monkeys and several
monkeys killed many of the demons.

Shlok 12: Some monkeys were smashed by spears and some others by finer weapons. Some were
struck by iron bars and some others were slit by axes.

Shlok 13: Yet again, some fell breathlessly on the ground and some were destroyed by the
arrows aimed at them with their hearts splits asunder.

Shlok 14: Cut into two with the strokes of swords by those powerful demons, some monkeys,
trembling, fell on the earth, their sides torn open.

Shlok 15: Even the flock of demons on all sides were crushed on to the earth by the furious
monkeys with tree and mountain-peaks.

Shlok 16: Having been administered thundering slaps with their hands and terrific blows with
their fists, the faces and eyes of demons were were lacerated. The demons vomited plenty of blood
from their months.

Shlok 17: A tumultuous clamour arose among monkeys and demons, as cries of pain and leonine
roars were bellowed.

Shlok 18: The monkeys and the demons with anger, following the path of heroes, with their
cruel and hostile eyes, accomplished their deeds with great courage.

Shlok 19: Narantaka Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata all these companions of Prahasta killed
the monkeys.

Shlok 20: Dvivida, with a mountain-peak, struck down Narantaka, the one among them who was
rushing upon quickly and killing the monkeys.

Shlok 21: The ape Durmukha on his part, with a ready hand, uprooted a very large tree and
crushed the demon Samunnata.

Shlok 22: The energetic Jambavan with a great fury seized a huge rock and threw it on the
chest-region of Mahanada.

Shlok 23: Then, the valiant Kumbhahanu there in the battle, having attacked the General Tara,
who was armed with a huge tree, received a blow immediately cost him his life.

Shlok 24: Not tolerating the aforesaid act, Prahasta having occupied his chariot with bow in
hand, caused a terrible havoc among the monkeys.

Shlok 25: Then, with the rapid movement of both the armies, there arose of clamour resembling
the roar of an unfathomable and tempestuous ocean in a time of dissolution.

Shlok 26: The demon Prahasta, who was hard to be subdued in battle, with full of anger,
tormented the monkeys by an immense avalanche of arrows in that great combat.

Shlok 27: By the frightening corpses of monkeys and demons, appearing like hideous mountains,
a very extensive area of the ground is covered.

Shlok 28: That ground, covered by the stream of blood, shone as in the month of spring when
overspread fully with the bloossoming crimson-coloured Palasa flowers.

Shlok 29- 30- 31- 32- 33: With the heaps of warriors for its banks the broken weapons its trees, the torrents
of blood its huge waves, death appeared like an ocean receiving its floods, livers and spleens its
mire, entrails its moss, severed heads and trunks the fish, and morsels of flesh the grass, the
innumerable vultures its lovely swans, herons its geese, covered as it was with fat for the foam,
the tumult the sound of its waters, the battle field resembled a river, incapable of being crossed
by cowards, visited by water-fowls at the end of the rainy season, those demons and the foremost of
the monkeys crossed over that impassable river, as elephants lead their herds across a lake that
the lotuses have covered with pollen.

Shlok 34: Then, Nila saw Prahasta who was employing a multitude of arrows sitting in the
chariot and annihilating the monkeys swiftly.

Shlok 35- 36: Seeing Nila who was running towards him in the battle-field, as a rocking wind in
the sky rushes towards a large massive clouds, Prahasta the Army general attacked Nila himself with
his chariot having the sun's colour.

Shlok 37: That Prahasta the Army General, who was excellent among the wielders of bow, drew
the bow-string and hurled the arrows towards Nila in that great battle.

Shlok 38: Those arrows with a great speed resembling furious snakes employed by Prahasta
proceeded towards Nila, pierced him and fell on the ground.

Shlok 39- 40: That great ape of prowess Nila, who was struck by sharp arrows resembling flames,
uprooted a tree and thumped it on the descending Prahasta who was most difficult to be
assaulted.

Shlok 41: Being unable to restrain the series of arrows hurled at him by that evil-minded
demon, nila received them with closed eyes.

Shlok 42: Like a bull standing under a sudden autumnal down-pour, so under that intolerable
and sudden rain of darts released by Prahasta, Nila endured with closed eyes though it was scarce
to be endured.

Shlok 43: The exceedingly strong and the great Nila, enraged over the volley of darts, killed
Prahasta's horses by hurling a huge Sala tree on them.

Shlok 44: Thereafter the greatly enraged Nila quickly broke the bow of Prahasta the
evil-minded demon and shouted again and again.

Shlok 45: Deprived of his bow, Prahasta the leader of the army, seizing a formidable mace,
leapt down from the chariot.

Shlok 46: Those two army-chiefs, who were courageous and in whom enmity had sprung up, with
their limbs covered with blood, wee standing like two elephants in rut.

Shlok 47- 48: Lion and tiger in gait, lion and tiger in gestures, those two warriors tore each
other with their shap teeth. Vanquishers of other heroes and intrepid combatants, both of them,
thirsting for fame, resembled Vritra and Indra.

Shlok 49: Then, that Prahasta exerting himself well struck Nila on his forehead with a mace
and blood oozed from his forehead.

Shlok 50: Whereupon, that great ape, his limbs smeared with blood, seized a huge tree and
struck Prahasta full in his chest with fury.

Shlok 51: Ignoring that blow, he seized a huge mace and ran in strength towards Nila the
strong monkey.

Shlok 52: Seeing Prahasta of terrible velocity briskly rushing towards him, Nila the great
monkey took a huge rock swiftly.

Shlok 53: Nila quickly hurled that rock on the head of Prahasta who was longing for war and
fighting with a mace in the battle.

Shlok 54: Then, that huge and terrific rock hurled by Nila the leader of the monkeys broke
Prahasa's head into myriad pieces.

Shlok 55: That Prahasta who lost his breath, was disfigured and dead, bereft of his senses and
at once fell on the ground like a tree cut up by the root.

Shlok 56: A lot of blood oozed from his broken head. From his body two, blood streamed forth
like a cascade from a mountain.

Shlok 57: Thier leader having been slain by Nila that unshakable and large army of demons,
becoming disconsolated, withdrew to Lanka.

Shlok 58: Thier chief of Army having been killed, those demons could not continue to stand
firmy there, any more than water on reaching a breached bridge.

Shlok 59: That Prahasta the chief of Army having been slain, those demons dumb dispirited and
inactive, regained the abode of their king. They became unconscious as it were plunged in an ocean
of burning grief.

Shlok 60: The triumphant Nila, however, was honoured by Rama and Lakshmana for his task well
accomplished and experienced supreme joy.



SARGA 59
------------------------------

[Text] Feeling desperate at the death of Prahasta, Ravana himself appears on the
battle-front for an encounter, along with Akampana, Indrajit, Atikaya, Mahodara, Pishacha,
Trishiras, Kumbha, Nimkumbha and Narantaka the foremost of demons. After a tough fight with
Sugreeva, Lakshmana, Hanuma and Nila, Ravana encounters Rama in battle, and sustaining an
ignominious defeat at the latter's hands and escaping with his life, withdraws to Lanka.

Shlok 1: While Prahasta the Army chief of demons was slain in the battle by Nila the foremost
among the monkeys, Ravana's army possessing terrible arms took to flight with the speed of a
tide.

Shlok 2: The demons went and told Ravana that Prahasta the Army chief had been killed by Nila
the son of Fire-god. Hearing those words of the demons, Ravana was possessed of anger.

Shlok 3: Hearing that Prahasta had perished in the fight, Ravana was afflicted with anger and
his heart filled with grief and he addressed the foremost of his leaders as Indra the Lord of
celestials to the leaders of the celestial troops (as follows):

Shlok 4: "That enemy is not to be despised; under whose blows the destroyer of Indra's host
the leader of my army with his followers and elephants fell."

Shlok 5: "I myself shall go to that wonderful battle-front without hesitation in order to
destroy the enemies and to gain victory."

Shlok 6: "As a forest is consumed by blazing fires, so shall I scorch that army of monkeys
now along with Lakshmana and Rama with a multitude of arrows. Today, I shall satiate the earth with
the blood of the monkeys."

Shlok 7: Speaking thus, Ravana the enemy of the Lord of celestials ascended his chariot which
shone like a flame and was yoked to a team of excellent horses with its brilliance of an effulgent
body.

Shlok 8: Ravana the best among the kings of demons sallied forth with the sound of couches,
kettle-drums, cymbals, clapping of hands and leonine roars and well-acclaimed by agreeable
encomiums.

Shlok 9: That Ravana along with the flesh-eating demons whose forms resembled mountains and
clouds and whose glances flashed like torches shone like Rudra the Lord of Immortals surrounded by
genii.

Shlok 10: Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary energy, issuing all at once from the city,
observed a ferocious army of monkeys with trees and rocks in their hands, ready for combat and
roaring like a vast ocean and a mass of thunder-clouds.

Shlok 11: Seeing that army of demons who were excessively furious, Rama whose arms resembled
great serpents, accompanied by his forces and having great fortune, spoke to Vibhishana the best
among the wielders of weapons (as follows):

Shlok 12: "Who is in command of this army, furnished with every kind of standard, banner and
canopy, armed with javelins, swords, stakes and other weapons and missiles and composed of
imperturbable soldiers and elephants as high as the Mahendra Mountain?"

Shlok 13: Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the equal of Indra in valour, then narrated to
Rama about the choicest army of the foremost among demons of the highest peculiarity (as
follows):

Shlok 14: "O Prince! That hero who has a face with a coppery hue resembling a newly rising
sun, coming on the back of an elephant causing its head to sway, know him to be Akampana."

Shlok 15: "He who, standing in his chariot, brandish his bow which has a splendour of Indra's
bow, whose standard bears the image of a lion, and who shines like unto an elephant with its
terrible curved tusks, he is Indrajit who is renowned for the boons he had received from
Brahma."

Shlok 16: "He who, the archer like unto the Vindhya, Asta or Mahendra Mountains, standing in
his chariot, a mighty warrior, of superior strength, who wields a bow of unequalled size and having
an exceedingly grown body, he is called Atikaya."

Shlok 17: "He who, with tawny eyes resembling the dawn, riding an elephant with its bells
jangling, who is shouting aloud, he is that strong demon of the highest peculiarity is called
Mahodara."

Shlok 18: "He who, ascending the brilliantly caparisoned horse raising high a gleaming
javelin, possesses a velocity of a well-directed thunder-bolt and resembles a mass of evening
clouds and a mountain, he is Pishacha."

Shlok 19: "He who, seizing a sharp spike with a possesses the velocity of a well-directed
thunder bolt and comes mounting on an excellent bull which shines like a moon, he is the
illustrious Trishiras."

Shlok 20: "The other resembling a thunder-bolt, of large and well-developed chest, who has an
attentive mind, has the King of Snakes as his standard, who is moving and twanging his bow, he is
Kumbha."

Shlok 21: "He who, holding a mace decorated with gold and diamonds, which are radiant (as
fire) and also smoky (studded with sapphires), who advances as a standard bearer tot he army of
demons, he is Nikumbha of Prodigious exploits."

Shlok 22: "He who, mounted in a chariot, adorned with flags, gleaming like a glowing blazer,
who is furnished with bows swords and a multitude of arrows, he is Narantaka who shines brightly
over there and who, in combat, fights with mountain-tops."

Shlok 23- 24: "He who, surrounded by ghosts of dreadful form of rolling eyes, with heads of
tigers, buffalo mighty elephants, deer and horses, under an excellent white canopy with slender
ribs and shining like a moon, he who is the humbler of the gods themselves, shining like unto Rudra
amidst the genii, is the suzerain Lord of Demons there."

Shlok 25: "Ravana, decked with a diadem, who has brought Indra the Lord of celestials and
Vaivasvata the Lord of Death low, is shining like the sun. His countenance is graced by ear-rings.
His formidable stature equals the Vindhya the Lord of Mountains."

Shlok 26: Then, Rama the annihilator of enemies, answered Vibhishana and said "Alas! What
glory, what majesty is Ravana's the Lord of Demons!

Shlok 27: "Ravana is beaming like the sun with his rays difficult to be gazed, neither can the
eye rest on him such is the binding strength of his magnificence!"

Shlok 28: "The body of celestial or demonical heroes may not be so radiant in this manner as
this body of the king of demons."

Shlok 29: "All the warriors of the suzerain Ravana are as high as hills. All fight with
mountains. All wield fiery weapons."

Shlok 30: "Amidst the fiery ghosts of terrible aspect, this king of demons shines like Yama
the Lord of Death surrounded by blazing genii endowed with hideous forms."

Shlok 31: "By good luck, that wretch comes today within my range of sight! Today, I shall
expunge my wrath, born of Seetha's abduction!"

Shlok 32: Having spoken thus, the valiant Rama who was accompanied by Lakshmana, took up his
bow and then standing erect, drew out an excellent arrow.

Shlok 33: Thereafter, that powerful Ravana spoke to those exceedingly strong demons as
follows: "Take up your positions unfalteringly and happily at the gates and principal exits, the
outposts and fortifications."

Shlok 34: "Learning of my presence along with you here, taking this to be a weak point and
storming this desolate city which is otherwise difficult to be overpowered, the monkeys when united
may destroy it by surprise."

Shlok 35: Having dismissed those counsellors and as the demons departed as ordered, Ravana
thereafter began to split under the waters of the sea of monkeys, in the same way as a gigantic
fish would rend the entire expanse of the sea.

Shlok 36: Seeing Ravana with his radiant bow, in the battle, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeys
tearing up a huge mountain-top, ran towards that king of demons.

Shlok 37: Seizing a mountain-top with its many trees and ridges, Sugreeva hurled it on Ravana
the demon. Seeing that mountain-top coming towards him, Ravana quickly broke it asunder with his
arrows with golden shafts.

Shlok 38: While that mountain-top with its well-developed ridges and excellent trees was rent
asunder and fell on the earth, Ravana like unto another Yama the Lord of Death, loosed an arrow
resembling a great serpent.

Shlok 39: The enraged Ravana, taking that arrow with the speed of a thunder bolt of Indra the
Lord of celestials and possessing the brilliance of a fire, hurled it to kill Sugreeva.

Shlok 40: That arrow released by Ravana's arm reached Sugreeva, having a bodily splendour
equal to that of Indra's thunder bolt, and pierced his body in its flight as formerly Guha's spear
when he discharged it at the Krauncha Mountain.

Shlok 41: Wounded by that arrow, which bereft him of consciousness, that warrior fell moaning
to the earth. Beholding him falling on the ground, deprived of his senses in the battle-field, the
demons raised a shout of triumph.

Shlok 42: Then, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha, Jyotimukha and Nala; of exceeding
corpulence tearing up rocks, rushed towards Ravana.

Shlok 43: That Lord of Demons, with hundreds of arrows, possessed of sharp points, rendered
their projectiles fruitless and pierced those leaders of the monkeys with a multitude of marvellous
golden shafted arrows.

Shlok 44: Pierced by the arrows of Ravana the Enemy of Gods, those monkey-Generals of
terrifying stature fell on the ground. Thereupon, he covered that formidable army of monkeys with a
shower of arrows.

Shlok 45: Assailed and fallen down, those monkey-warriors, emitted cries as though struck by
an arrow of terror, whom Ravana was destroying with his darts and fled for refuge to Rama who is
capable of affording protection to all.

Shlok 46: Then the high-souled Rama the skilful archer, taking his bow, set out at once.
Lakshmana, however, approaching him with joined palms, spoke very meaningful words follows:

Shlok 47: "O, noble Brother! Of my own accord, I am able to kill this wretched Ravana. O,
Lord! I shall slay him. Permit me to do so."

Shlok 48: The exceedingly powerful and the truly courageous Rama spoke to that Lakshmana as
follows: "Go, Lakshmana and also be strenuous in this duel."

Shlok 49: "Ravana is endowed with great strength and possesses an outstanding prowess during a war. The Three Worlds themselves could not withstand his fury. There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 50: "Seek out his weak points and guard against your own. Defend yourself vigilantly
with your eye and bow."

Shlok 51: Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana embraced him, thereafter offering obeisance and
bidding him farewell, he entered the battle-field.

Shlok 52: Lakshmana then saw Ravana with arms as large as the trunks of elephants, who was
brandishing his dreadful and fiery bow, covering those monkeys whose bodies he had severed with a
close rain of darts.

Shlok 53: The exceedingly energetic Hanuma, born of Maruta the god of wind, beholding this,
rushed on Ravana in order to bring that rain of arrows to an end.

Shlok 54: Approaching his chariot, the sagacious Hanuma lifted his right arm and spoke the
following threatening words to Ravana:

Shlok 55: "You have obtained the boon of invulnerability to the celestials, demons, celestial
musicians, ogres and semi-divine beings. But monkeys are a danger to you."

Shlok 56: "This five-branched right hand of mine, which I now raise, will rob you of your life
that has long been resident in your body."

Shlok 57: Hearing the words of Hanuma, the exceedingly valiant Ravana, his eyes inflamed with
anger, answered.

Shlok 58: "Strike quickly without fear, O Monkey! Win eternal renown. Thereafter, I shall
destroy you, after measuring your strength."

Shlok 59: Hearing the words of Ravana, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke the following words:
"Recollect that I have killed your son Aksha already."

Shlok 60: Thus spoken, the highly energetic and the valiant Ravana the Lord of Demons struck
Hanuma the son of Anila a violent blow on his chest with the palm of his hand.

Shlok 61: Hanuma, thus struck with Ravana's palm, reeled repeatedly. Thereafter the highly
sagacious and illustrious Hanuma secured his balance within a moment and in fury, struck Ravana the
enemy of Immortals with the very palm of his hand.

Shlok 62: Under the violent impact of the blow of the mighty Hanuma Ravana shook like a
mountain when the earth trembles.

Shlok 63: Beholding Ravana struck in the fight by Hanuma's palm; the sages, monkeys,
semi-divine beings, along with celestials and demons raised a resounding approbation.

Shlok 64: Then, the extremely spirited Ravana, having regained his breath, spoke the following
words: "Well done! Well done! O, monkey! You are my adversary, worthy of praise by your
valour!"

Shlok 65: Then, Hanuma answered, "O, Ravana! Cursed by that strength since you do still
survive!"

Shlok 66: "O, foolish fellow! Why this boasting? Now come, strike me once! My fist is about to
dispatch you to the Abode of Yama the Lord of Death!"

Shlok 67- 68: Hearing the words of Hanuma, the powerful Ravana, enraged, his eyes red with fury
and whirling his fist with force knocked it down violently on Hanuma's chest.

Shlok 69: Under the shock, Hanuma reeled once again. Seeing that mighty Hanuma exhausted,
Ravana turned his chariot towards Nila.

Shlok 70- 71: With his terrific arrows in the likeness of serpents, Ravana the powerful Lord of
Demons pierced the vital parts of his enemy, thus overwhelming Nila the Monkey-general.

Shlok 72: Nila, the Army General of Monkeys, tormented by that hail of arrows, with one hand
hurled a great rock at Ravana the king of demons.

Shlok 73- 74: Meanwhile, Hanuma of exalted mind, burning with courage, regained his breath and in
his martial ire cried out furiously towards Ravana, the Lord of Demons who occupied in fight with
Nila as follows: "It is not proper to engage in a combat with a person who is already doing a fight
with another."

Shlok 75: Then, the mighty Ravana, however, shattered the rock hurled by Nila with seven
pointed arrows and it fell down, crumbling to pieces.

Shlok 76: Seeing that rock crumbling to pieces, Nila the Army-general the destroyer of enemies
who resembled the Fire of Time, glowed with fury.

Shlok 77: In that fight, Nila hurled Aswakarna trees, Shala trees with extensive flowering,
Chuta trees and other various types of trees.

Shlok 78: Ravana, confronting those trees, bursted them and showered a hail of dangerous darts
on Nila the son of Fire-God.

Shlok 79: Showered by a multitude of shafts, as from a cloud, the mighty Nila assumed a
diminutive form and leapt on to the point of Ravana's standard.

Shlok 80: Seeing Nila the son of Fire-God standing well on the point of his standard, Ravana
inflamed with fury. Then, Nila shouted loudly.

Shlok 81: Beholding that monkey sometimes leaping on to the point of Ravana's standard
sometimes on to the tip of his bow and sometimes on to the peak of his diadem, Lakshmana, Hanuma
and Rama were astonished.

Shlok 82: The mighty Ravana, amazed at the monkey's agility, seized a marvellous and glowing
arrow called Agneya the weapon of Fire.

Shlok 83: Thereafter, those monkeys who felt rejoiced to see Ravana disconcerted at the
agility of Nila and had found an occasion for jubilation, shouted joyously.

Shlok 84: Then, provoked by the shouts of the monkeys, his heart possessed with confusing,
Ravana did not know what to do.

Shlok 85: Ravana the demon, taking up an arrow, charged with the missile presided over by the
fire-God, aimed at Nila who had perched on the tip of his standard.

Shlok 86: Then, Ravana the king of demons said,: "O monkey! You are endowed with agility
combined with a supreme power of magic."

Shlok 87: "Do you save your life if you can, eventhogh you are creating numerous deeds of
various kinds indeed worthy of your own self, O, monkey!"

Shlok 88: "Even then, the arrow charged with a mystic missile I am about to loose, will severe
you from life, which existence you seek to preserve."

Shlok 89: Thus speaking, Ravana the long-armed King of Demons, having placed Agni Missile with
his arrow, struck Nila the Army-General.

Shlok 90: Struck on the chest by the arrow combined with a missile, Nila being burnt all over,
suddenly fell to the ground.

Shlok 91: Yet by virtue of the powerful aid of his father and his own native vigour, though
brought to his knees on to the earth, he was not deprived of his life.

Shlok 92: Seeing Nila unconscious, Ravana, eager for fight, in his chariot whose rattling
sounded like thunder-clouds, rushed on Lakshmana.

Shlok 93: Coming to the centre of the battle-field, the powerful Ravana the King of Demons
prevented Lakshmana to go forward, halted, standing there in his glory and lifted up his bow.

Shlok 94: Lakshmana of indomitable courage spoke to that Ravana who was lifting up his
unfathomable bow (as follows): "O, King of Demons! Now enter into combat with me; cease from
fighting with the monkeys!"

Shlok 95: Hearing that marvellously modulated voice that resounded like the twanging of a
bow-string, Ravana drawing near his adversary, who stood close to his chariot, answered in
anger:

Shlok 96: "O, Lakshmana! By my good fortune, you in your perverted mind, reached within my
range of sight so as to meet your death. This very instant, you will go to the region of Death,
after having collapsed by the bang of my rain of arrows."

Shlok 97: Then, Lakshmana, unmoved spoke to that Ravana who was roaring with his sharp and
protruding teeth (as follows): "Greatly dignified ones eschew bragging! O, the foremost of
evil-doers! You are sounding your own praises!"

Shlok 98: "O, King of Demons! I know your valour, strength, energy and courage! Come! I now
stand here, with my bow and arrows in hand. O what use are vain boasts."

Shlok 99: Thus accosted, the King of Demons, infuriated, loosened seven marvellously plumed
arrows which Lakshmana shattered with his beautiful golden-shafted arrows of sharp ends and
edges.

Shlok 100: Beholding those arrows shattered like great cobras with their hoods shattered,
Ravana got angry and loosened other sharp arrows.

Shlok 101: Lakshmana, however, caused a well-aimed rain of missiles from his bow to fall on
Ravana and nay, even broke Ravana's arrows with his arrows called Khura, Ardhachandra, the
excellent Karni and Bhalla. He did not feel perturbed.

Shlok 102: Seeing his successive arrows proving in vain, Ravana the King of those hostile to
Gods was astonished at Lakshmana's skill and released more whetted shafts upon him.

Shlok 103: Lakshmana, the equal of Mahendra the Lord of celestials, fixing some sharpened
arrows, swift as lightning and of blazing effulgence on his bow-string, discharged them on Ravana
in order to strike him down.

Shlok 104: Whereupon, Ravana the King of Demons shattered those pointed arrows and struck
Lakshmana in the forehead with a struck Lakshmana in the forehead with a shaft as bright as the
Fire of Time, which had been bestowed on him by Brahma the Lord of Creation.

Shlok 105: Struck by Ravana's arrow, Lakshmana reeled a little and was scarcely able to retain
his bow. But, coming to his consciousness with difficulty, he shattered that weapon belonging to
Ravana, Indra's enemy.

Shlok 106: Then, Lakshmana the son of Dasaratha struck Ravana, whose bow was broken, with three
pointed darts. The king, pierced by those arrows, swooned and regained his senses with
difficulty.

Shlok 107: Ravana, the enemy of celestials, whose bow was broken, struck by the arrows, his
limbs spattered with flesh, and streaming with blood, himself of formidable energy, seized in the
battle a spear gifted to him by Brahma the Lord of Creation.

Shlok 108: Ravana the Lord of the country of demons hurled with strength on Lakshmana, that
blazing spear, emitting smoke and as bright as fire, frightening the monkeys in the fray.

Shlok 109: Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata struck that weapon falling upon him with
arrows and darts, as if it were a sacrificial fire. Nevertheless, that spear entered Lakshmana's
broad chest.

Shlok 110: The mighty Lakshmana, struck by the spear, lay on the earth, breathing fire. The
king, rushing suddenly on him who was yet insensible, seized him brutally in his hands.

Shlok 111: Though he was able to lift up Himavat, Mandara and Meru mountains as also the Three
Worlds with the Gods, he could not raise Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata.

Shlok 112: Lakshmana, though wounded in the breast by Brahma's weapon, recollected that he was
an inconceivable fraction of Vishnu Himself.

Shlok 113: Ravana that thorn in the side of the Gods, though overcoming that Lakshmana who
removed the pride of demons, was unable to bear him away with his hands.

Shlok 114: Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma the son of the Wind-God, rushed towards Ravana and
struck angrily on his chest with his fist, resembling a thunder-bolt.

Shlok 115: By that blow of the fist, Ravana the Lord of Demons reeled and fell on his knees to
the ground.

Shlok 116: A lot of blood oozed out from his face, eyes, and ears. Reeled and motionless, he
became and sat in the middle of the chariot.

Shlok 117: Seeing Ravana despite his redoubtable strength swooned on the battle-field, sages
and monkeys began to shout in triumph as did also celestials and the demons (invisibly present on
the scene).

Shlok 118: Then, the courageous Hanuma lifting up Lakshmana in his arms, who had been wounded
by Ravana, brought him to Rama's presence.

Shlok 119: That Lakshmana, whom his foes were unable to move, became light for Hanuma because
of friendship and great devotion of Hanuma the son of Wind-God towards him.

Shlok 120: That spear leaving Lakshmana, who was overcome in the battle, returned to its
position in that chariot of Ravana.

Shlok 121: The mighty Ravana too, regaining his consciousness in the great battle-field, picked
up his sharp arrows and the great bow.

Shlok 122: Healed and free from that lance, Lakshmana the annihilator of his foes, recollected
of himself as a part of the inconceivable Vishnu the Lord of Preservation.

Shlok 123: Beholding the great army of monkeys whose great warriors were overthrown on the
battle-field, Rama rushed on Ravana.

Shlok 124- 125: Meanwhile, Hanuma approaching Rama spoke the following words: "You have to punish
the demon by climbing my back, as Vishnu on Garuda in order to fight with the Enemy of Gods."

Shlok 126: Hearing those words spoken by Hanuma the son of Wind-God, Rama soon after mounted
the great monkey, Hanuma. Rama the Lord of men then saw Ravana standing in his chariot in the
battle-field.

Shlok 127: The mighty Rama became angry on seeing him and rushed upon that Ravana like unto
Vishnu with his uplifted mace rushed upon Virochana.

Shlok 128: Rama made a sound in drawing the cord of his bow and like unto the roll of thunder,
spoke in a deep voice to Ravana as follows:

Shlok 129: "O, Tiger among the Demons! Stay, stay! Having evoked such a displeasure to me,
where will you flee and get an abandonment?"

Shlok 130: "Even if you seek refuge in the region of Indra the Lord of celestials or Yama the
Lord of Death or the Sun or Brahma the Lord of Creation or Agni the Lord of Fire or Shiva the Lord
of dissolution or in the ten regions, even in those abodes you will elude me from now on."

Shlok 131: "O, Ravana the King of Demons! The one who was struck by the spear, fell swooping
this day only to recover consciousness immediately, will now, assuming the form of death, claim
you, your sons and grandsons in battle."

Shlok 132: "Here is he, under whose blows of arrows, fourteen thousand demons of terrible form
perished, who had established themselves in Janasthana and were furnished with excellent
weapons."

Shlok 133- 134: Hearing the words of Rama, Ravana of great strength, full of rage and recollecting
his former hostility struck with flaming arrows resembling the tongues of the Fire of Dissolution,
on Hanuman the son of Wind-God, who with extreme velocity, was bearing Rama in the
battle-field.

Shlok 135: Even when struck by that demon with his arrows in the battle, the vigour of Hanuman,
who was endowed with native strength, increased still further.

Shlok 136: Thereupon, seeing Hanuman the Tiger among the monkeys getting wounded by Ravana,
Rama was transported with anger.

Shlok 137: Going near his chariot with his sharp and pointed arrows, Rama shattered it along
with its wheels, horses, banner, canopy, great standard, charioteer, darts, spears and swords.

Shlok 138: Thereupon, with a great force, Rama struck with his shaft shining brightly as the
thunderbolt, that Ravana, the enemy of Indra, in his broad and beautiful chest, even as the mighty
Indra would strike the Mount Meru with his thunderbolt.

Shlok 139: That valiant King of Demons, whom neither thunder nor lightning could cause
disturbance or trembling; stumbled letting fall his bow at the valiant impact of Rama's missile
which created a deep injury.

Shlok 140: Seeing that Ravana swooning, the magnanimous Rama took up a blazing arrow shaped
like a crescent moon and immediately used it to shatter the diadem of Ravana the Lord of Demons,
which was of bright hue.

Shlok 141: In that battle-field, Rama said to that Lord of Demons whose splendour was dimmed,
the setting of his diadem river, who resembled a venomous snake robbed of its poison or like a sun
its rays extinguished, bereft of lustre.

Shlok 142: "You have accomplished a highly terrific great feat and my brave soldiers have
succumbed beneath your blows. Now, you are weary and in this condition, I shall not put you under
the clutches of Death."

Shlok 143: "O, King of the Ranger of night! I know you have been tormented in the battle. Go
and return to Lanka. Having regained your breath, come back in your chariot with your bow and then
standing in your chariot, you will witness once more my prowess."

Shlok 144: At these words, that King Ravana, his joy boasting subdued, his bow shattered, his
horses and chariot slain pierced with arrows, his great diadem broken, he soon returned to
Lanka.

Shlok 145: While that mighty Ravana the Lord of Demons and the enemy of celestials and titans
returned to Lanka, Rama arranged for drawing out arrows from monkeys and from Lakshmana too, in the
forefront of that vast battle-field.

Shlok 146: That Ravana, the adversary of the King of the Gods being vanquished, the celestials,
Asuras the multitude of beings in all the quarters, the creatures of the ocean with the great
serpents as also all beings on earth and in waters rejoiced very much.



SARGA 60
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana returns to Lanka and asks some demons to go to the abode of sleeping
Kumbhakarna, to wake him up and request him to come to him. The slumbering Kumbhakarna is roused by
the demons under orders of their king. Kumbhakarna, giant in form, sets out on the high way to see
Ravana and the monkeys get alarmed to see the giant demon.

Shlok 1: Returning to the City of Lanka, Ravana the King of Demons was afflicted with the
fear of Rama's arrows, his pride was humbled and his senses troubled.

Shlok 2: The king was overcome by the high-souled Rama, like an elephant is by a lion or a
serpent by an eagle.

Shlok 3: The Lord of Demons was maddened in recollecting Rama's arrows resembling the Rod of
Brahma the Lord of creation and possessed of the splendour of lightning.

Shlok 4: Resting on an excellent and charming throne made of gold, Ravana looked at the
demons and spoke the following words:

Shlok 5: "All that great penance performed by me became a waste indeed, for, I who am equal
to Mahendra the Lord of Celestials have been defeated by a mere man!"

Shlok 6: "The terrible words of Brahma the Lord of Creation saying, 'You know of the threat
from men' appear true. That is so."

Shlok 7: "I sought immunity from death at the hands of celestials, titans or celestials
musicians, or semi divine beings or demons or serpent-demons, but f man I made no mention."

Shlok 8- 9: "Rama the son of Dasaratha is the man I think of whom Anaranya born of Ikshvaku
dynasty formerly spoke, saying: 'O, the worst of demons, the worst of your race and the wretched
one! In my race will be born a man who will slay you in battle with your sons, ministers, army,
horses and charioteer."

Shlok 10: "Further, I was formerly cursed by Vedavati when she was humiliated by me. The same
Vedavati is born as the highly fortunate Seetha the daughter of Janaka."

Shlok 11: "What was predicted by Parvati the consort of Shiva, Nandishvara the attendant of
Shiva, Rambha the wife of Nalakubara and Punjikasthala the daughter of Varunda has come to pass!
The words of the sages never prove false."

Shlok 12: "On account of all this and admitting it, you should exert yourselves to the
uttermost. Let the demons go to the summit of Charya Mountain."

Shlok 13: "Awaken that kumbhakarna, who is without equal in prowess, who humbles the pride of
the celestials and demons, and on whom the curse of Brahma the Lord of creation rests."

Shlok 14: Having known that Prahasta being slain and knowing himself to have been defeated in
the battle, Ravana issued his commands tot he dreadful army, saying:

Shlok 15: "Guard the gates with utmost care. Man the ramparts. Rouse Kumbhakarna who is
slumbering soundly."

Shlok 16: "Kumbhakarna is sleeping happily, his understanding vitiated by lust and free from
all anxieties. The demon sleeps for nine, seven, ten or eight months.

Shlok 17: "Having deliberated with me nine days ago, he has since fallen asleep. Awaken
quickly that mighty Kumbhakarna."

Shlok 18: "The mighty armed Kumbhakarna, the foremost of all demons will kill the monkeys and
the two princes at once in the battle."

Shlok 19: "This Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the demons and a great mark in the battle,
being fond of a rustic comfort, is always sleeping stupidly."

Shlok 20: "If Kumbhakarna is awaken, there will be no worry for me, who stand defeated by Rama
in this highly terrific battle."

Shlok 21: "What is the use of him, who possessing a strength equal to that of Indra the Lord
of celestials, cannot help me in such a dreadful catastrophe?"

Shlok 22: Hearing those words of Ravana, those demons very briskly went to the abode of
Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 23- 24: Entering the beautiful cave of Kumbhakarna, with a large door, having an area of a
Yojana on all sides and bearing a floral perfume, the demons of mighty strength, though shaken off
by Kumbhakarna's breaths, remained stable forcefully with difficulty and went into the cave.

Shlok 25: Entering that beautiful cave inlaid with diamonds and gold, those tigers among
demons beheld Kumbhakarna, of terrific prowess, who was sleeping.

Shlok 26: They together tried to awaken Kumbhakarna who was sleeping nastily like a spread-out
mountain in a great slumber.

Shlok 27- 28- 29: His limbs covered with down which stood on end, breathing like a serpent, as he
slept, Kumbhakarna of irresistible valour emitted dreadful snores, his nostrils being horrible, and
his mouth a gaping hell. Stretched to his full length on the earth, he gave forth an odour of
marrow and blood, his limbs were adorned with golden armlets and he wore a diadem as bright as the
sun, thus did that lion among demons, Kumbhakarna, the slayer of his foes, appear!

Shlok 30: Then, those powerful demons, in order to satisfy him, placed a heap of venison as
high as Mount Meru, in front of Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 31: Those excellent demons piled up a great mass of wonderful food with the meat of
deers, buffaloes and pigs.

Shlok 32: Then, the demons placed pots of blood and various kinds of meat in front of
Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 33: They rubbed Kumbhakarna the scourge of his foes with the most rare sandalwood and
refreshed him with celestial and fragrant garlands as well as sweet-smelling perfumes.

Shlok 34: They burnt incenses and hymned the praises of that warrior who proved fatal to his
foes. They cried out noises which burst forth on every side like thunder.

Shlok 35: They blew couches which were as bright as the moon and with impatience, made with
impatience, made sounds tumultuously all at once.

Shlok 36: Those demons made sounds by clapping their hands, in order to awaken Kumbhakarna and
shook him too, creating a great clamour.

Shlok 37: The birds passing through the sky ran helter-shelter and fell down soon on hearing
the sounds of the couches, drums, gongs, clapping of hands and leonine roars.

Shlok 38: As the illustrious Kumbhakarna did not waken from his slumber despite those great
sounds, all troops of demons seized hold of bars, pestles and maces towards him.

Shlok 39: Then, the cruel demons struck that sleeping Kumbhakarna on his chest with
mountain-tops, pestles, maces, hammers and their fists.

Shlok 40: Even with all their strength, the demons could not stand upright before the
breathing winds of Kumbhakarna, the demon.

Shlok 41: Then, the terribly strong demons firmly seated themselves round him and began to
beat drums, cymbals, kettle-drums and myriads of couches and trumpets.

Shlok 42: Ten thousand demons surrounded him all at once. Beating that colossus who resembled
a heap of antimony, the demons on their part tried to rouse him by making sounds. Even then, he did
not wake.

Shlok 43: As they were unable to rouse him by these means, they resorted to more energetic and
ruthless methods.

Shlok 44: They beat horses, camels, donkeys, and elephants with sticks whips and thongs, so
that they trample upon him and blasted kettle-drums, couches and drums.

Shlok 45: They crushed his limbs under piles of heavy logs and pillars, as also maces lifted
with all their strength.

Shlok 46: The entire Lanka, with its mountain and groves, was filled with great noise. He
nevertheless did not wake.

Shlok 47: Then, they beat a thousand drums all around with sticks of refined gold.

Shlok 48: Yet, as he did not wake from his profound slumber, being under the spell of a curse,
the demons were enraged.

Shlok 49: All those demons of terrible strength were filled with a great fury. Some others
assembled their strength to awaken that demon.

Shlok 50: Some beat drums, some shouted, some tore out his hair and some others bit his
ears.

Shlok 51: Some poured hundreds of pitchers of water into his ears but Kumbhakarna, plunged in
deep sleep, did not stir.

Shlok 52: Some strong ones, armed with rocks and hammers, struck the rocks and hammers on his
head, chest and other limbs.

Shlok 53: Though smitten by missiles fastened with ropes on all sides, the giant bodied demon
did not wake.

Shlok 54: A thousand elephants ran up and down on his body till Kumbhakarna lightly woke up
and became aware of the pressure.

Shlok 55: Being insensible to those violent blows of crags and trees hurled upon him, but
under the prompting of extreme hunger, Kumbhakarna suddenly sprang up from sleep, yawning due to
loss of sleep.

Shlok 56: Waving his arms resembling serpent's coils or the peaks of mountains, hard as cut
diamonds, that demons opening his monstrous month like unto the face of a submarine fire,
yawned.

Shlok 57: His mouth yawning horribly resembled hell and appeared like the sun rising under the
high peak of Meru Mountain.

Shlok 58: That mighty demon, being awake, yawned, heaving a sigh, like unto a tempest arising
from a mountain.

Shlok 59: That figure of Kumbhakarna, rising up, stood out resembling Time at the dissolution
of the world, prepared to devour all beings.

Shlok 60: His huge eyes, resembling flames of fire, with a glitter equal to that of lightning,
appeared like great blazing planets.

Shlok 62: Then, the demons pointed to various kinds of victuals, boar and buffalo. The mighty
Kumbhakarna devoured them.

Shlok 63: Then, the hungry Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, ate the meat and being thirsty
drank the blood and gulped pitchers full of fat and wine.

Shlok 64: Thereupon, knowing that Kumbhakarna was gratified of his hunger, the demons
approached him, saluting him with their heads bent and surrounded him on all sides.

Shlok 65: Raising his eyelids that were heavy with sleep, his gaze still veiled, he directed
his glance towards those demons and spoke as follows:

Shlok 66: That excellent demons kindly addressing all the demons and surprised at being
roused, spoke the following words to the demons:

Shlok 66: "For what reason have you thus wakened me so suddenly? Is all well with the king or
anything in peril here?"

Shlok 67: "Surely, there must be some great danger from an external source since you have
wakened me in haste."

Shlok 68: "Now, I shall drive away the misfortune from Ravana the King of Demons, even if I
have to cut Mahendra himself to pieces or to freeze the Fire.

Shlok 69: "For a petty reason, one does not indeed awaken, one such as I, from my slumber.
Hence, tell me frankly, for what reason you have roused me."

Shlok 70: Yupaksha, a minister of the King, with his hands joined salutation, spoke (as
follows) to Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of his enemies, thus talking excitedly.

Shlok 71: "O, Prince! There is no threat whatsoever at anytime for us from celestials but a
mere man is driving us back by a tumultuous tremor."

Shlok 72: "O, Prince! It is not indeed the celestials or demons who have put us in such a
peril as it comes to us from a man."

Shlok 73: "Monkeys, whose forms are as large as mountains, are besieging Lanka. There is a
tumultuous peril for us from Rama, who is furious on account of Seetha's abduction."

Shlok 74: "Already, a single monkey set fire to our great city of slew the youthful Prince
Aksha with his escort of elephants and retinue."

Shlok 75: " ' Get thee hence' were the words addressed by Rama who is equal to the sun in
splendour, to Ravana in person the Lord of Demons and the trouble-some person to celestials."

Shlok 76: "That which this king never suffered at the hands of Gods or Demons or Danavas, he
has had to endure here from Rama, who released him from the danger to his life."

Shlok 77: Hearing about the humiliation of his brother in the battle through the words of
Yupaksha, Kumbhakarna rolling his great eyes, spoke to Yupaksha (as follows):

Shlok 78: "O, Yupaksha! Now itself, after conquering the entire army of monkeys with Lakshmana
and Rama on the battle-field, then only I shall see Ravana."

Shlok 79: "I shall satiate the demons with the flesh and blood of monkeys and, as for Rama and
Lakshmana, I shall drink their blood myself."

Shlok 80: Hearing these haughty from that demon, whose anger increased his ferocity, Mahodara
the chief of warriors of demons, having offered obeisance with joined palms, spoke the following
words:

Shlok 81: "O, the mighty armed! When you have listened to the words of Ravana and considered
the advantages and disadvantages of the matter, even afterwards you can conquer the enemies in
battle."

Shlok 82: Hearing the words of Mahodara, the might Kumbhakarna of great valour prepared to
depart, surrounded by demons.

Shlok 83: The demons, having awaken that sleeping Kumbhakarna of dreadful eyes, form and
valour, went to the King's palace in haste.

Shlok 84: All those demons, approaching Ravana who was seated on the throne, said to him with
joined palms, as follows:

Shlok 85: "O, Lord of Demons! Kumbhakarna, your brother, has wakened. Is it your will that he
should enter the battle field from there itself or do you desire him to come here and see you?"

Shlok 86: Ravana answered those demons who stood before him and with a glad heart, said: "I
want to see him here. Bring him after extending the honours due to him in a befitting manner."

Shlok 87: Uttering "Be it so", all those demons as commanded by Ravana, returned to
Kumbhakarna and spoke the following words:

Shlok 88: "The king, the lion of all the demons, desires to see you. Go and gratify your
brother!"

Shlok 89: Hearing his brother's wish, Kumbhakarna the inviolable demon of great prowess,
uttering "so be it", leapt up from his couch.

Shlok 90: Washing his face and bathing, refreshed and delighted, adorning himself well and
feeling thirsty, he hastened them to bring him a drink which can boost up his strength.

Shlok 91: Thereupon, those demons brought him quickly the wine and various kinds of eatable
there, in their hurry to take Kumbhakarna with them as per Ravana's commands.

Shlok 92: Having drunk two thousand pitchers, Kumbhakarna prepared to set out and slightly
inebriated and flushed, he was exhilarated and filled with energy.

Shlok 93: The fuming Kumbhakarna, going to his brother's palace along with the army of demons,
appeared like Yama the Lord of Death at the end of all-destroying Time. He caused the earth to
tremble with his foot-steps, while marching.

Shlok 94: The royal high way was illumined by his body, like unto that orb of a thousand rays
(the sun) by its flashes illumines the earth and he went there, surrounded by a circle of demons
paying obeisance, resembling Indra the Lord of Celestials approaching the abode of Brahma the Lord
of Creation.

Shlok 95: Seeing that slayer of his foes on the royal high way, that monster as high as the
peak of a mountain, those monkeys stationed outside the city, as also their leaders, were
frightened suddenly.

Shlok 96: Some gained refuge in Rama who affords protection, some fell down tottering, some
fled away perturbed in all directions and some others lay on the ground, confounded with fear.

Shlok 97: Seeing that colossus appearing like a great peak, having a diadem who seemed to
touch the sun with his brilliance, the monkeys were seized with terror and had grown immensely in
size, fled hither and thither.

[Text] Rama sees Kumbhakarna with a colossal body and enquires Vibhishana about a report of
him. Then Vibhishana apprises Rama about Kumbhakarna and narrates his story of his getting curse
from Brahma, imprecating him to sleep apparently Vibhishana adds that on an appeal from Ravana
Brahma relaxed the curse saying that Kumbhakarna would keep sleeping for every six months and then
waking up for a day in a year Vibhishana informs Rama that Ravana got Kumbhakarna awakened and is
sending now to the battle. Rama then orders Neela the commander-in-cheif to marshal his entire army
of monkeys in their appropriate positions in Lanka. On hearing Rama's orders the army of monkeys
start their fighting operation.

Shlok 1: Having taken his bow, Rama of great brilliance and prowess, then beheld the bulky
Kumbhakarna, adorned with a diadem.

Shlok 2: Seeing that paramount demon, whose appearance was in the form of a mountain and
looking like Lord Narayana (the son of the original Man); taking strides across space, (manifested
in the form of Trivikrama, who measured the whole universe in a couple of strides) Rama became
vigilant.

Shlok 3: Beholding him again, who was appear like a rainy black cloud and wearing a golden
bracelet as an ornament on his upper arm, that huge army of monkeys took to their heels in full
speed.

Shlok 4: Seeing the army running away and the demon increasing his body, Rama with a
surprise, spoke to vibhishana as follows:

Shlok 5: "This eminent demon, appearing as a mountain, with a diadem and tawmy eyes and
looking like a cloud with a flash of lightning, is seen in Lanka. Who is he?"

Shlok 6: "He alone with a huge body here on this earth, is appearing like a solitary meteror,
by seeing whom all the monkeys are running away hither and thither."

Shlok 7: "Who is he with such a colossal body? Tell me whether he is a demon or an evil
spirit. I have not seen such a creature earlier at any time."

Shlok 8: Thus asked by Rama the prince, who was unweary in action, the highly intelligent
Vibhishana replied to Rama as follows:

Shlok 9: "He is the powerful Kumbhakarna, the son of Visravasa. He conquered Yama and Indra
in battle. Tehre is no other demon, corresponding to the size of his body."

Shlok 10: "O Rama! He conquered thousands of celestials, demons, a class of demi-gods, serpent
demons, ogres, Gandharvas teh celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the celestials artistes and Kinnaras
(the semi-divine beings with the human form and the head of a horse) in battle."

Shlok 11: "Seeing the mighty Kumbharana with ghastly eyes and a spear in hand, the celestials
were not able to kill him, having confused to think that he was yama the god of Death."

Shlok 12: "This Kumbhakarna, by his very nature, is energetic and mighty. The strength of the
other demon-chiefs is attributable to boons (granted on request by gods)."

Shlok 13: "Soon after his birth, this great-souled demon, afflicted as he was by hunger, ate
thousands of living creatures."

Shlok 14: "While the living being were being eaten, the frightened people sought refuge with
Indra and even reported the matter about him."

Shlok 15: That Mahendra wielding a thunder-bolt was enraged and struck Kumbhakarna with his
weapon of the white thunderbolt. The great souled Kumbhakarna struck by Indra's thunderbolt was
quite agitatated at it and roared loudly with anger."

Shlok 16: "Hearing the roar of that Kumbakarna, the demon, wh was howling loudly, the
grigthened people were further frightened."

Shlok 17: "Enraged as he was on Mahendra, the mighty Kumbhakarna then pulled out a tusk of
Airavata, Indra's elephant and struck it into Indra's chest."

Shlok 18: "That Devendra, tormented by the hit of Kumbhakarna, was burning with rage. The
celestials, Brahmanical sages and demons were suddenly aggrieved. Even Indra with his people went
to the abode of Brahma the Lord of creation."

Shlok 19- 20: "They informed about the evil-mind of Kumbhakarna to Brahma, how he devoured the
living creatures, his assault on celestials, the destroyal of hermitages and his taking away of
others' wives."

Shlok 21: "If he eats away the created beings continuously like this, the world will become
desolate just soon after some time."

Shlok 22: "On hearing the words of Indra, Brahama, the great grandfather of the entire world,
called for the demons and saw Kumbhakarna too along with them."

Shlok 23: "Just on seeing Kumbhakarna even Brahma was frightened. Thereafter on restoring his
confidence, Brahma cursed Kumbhakarna as follows:

Shlok 24: "It is sure that you were created by visravasa for the destroyal of people. On that
account, you will be sleeping apparently dead from now onwards."

Shlok 25: "Humbled by Brahma's curse, Kumbhakarna then fell down in front of Ravana.
Thereupon, the highly perplexed Ravana spoke the following words:"

Shlok 26: "'O Brahma! You are cutting off a well-grown golden tree, just at the time of
yielding its fruit. It is not fair on your part to curse your own great grandson like this."

Shlok 27: "Your words can never prove to be in vain. There is no doubt about it. He will have
to sleep certainly. Let some space of time be fixed for his sleeping and waking."

Shlok 28: "Hearing the words of Ravana, Brahma spoke as follows: He will indeed sleep for six
months and wake-up for a day."

Shlok 29: "On that single day, this male demon, having starved for six months, will wander
over the earth and eat the human race with his month wide open, like an augmented fire."

Shlok 30: "Ravana, the king of demons, who got into an evil plight and frightened as he was in
seeing your prowess, now got Kumbhakarna awakened."

Shlok 31: "This Kumbhakarna the male-demon with a terrific prowess started his tent. The
highly enraged Kumbhakara devourincg the monkeys on is way, is running towards us."

Shlok 32: "Even on merely seeing Kumbhakarna, the monkeys have now fled away. How can the
monkeys check him, who is thus enraged in battle?"

Shlok 33: "Let all the monkeys be told that it is a kind of machine, advancing forward. By
knowing this, they can become fearless by now."

Shlok 34: On hearing Vibhishana's words, which were well-founded to make the monkeys
well-inclined to fight the battle, Rama then spoke the follwoing words to neela, the chief of
army:

Shlok 35: "O Neela the son of fire-god. Go, marshalling the entire army. Occupying the
door-ways, high-ways and bridges of Lanka, stand ready for operation."

Shlok 36: "Draw together the mountain-tops, trees and even the rocks. Let all the monkeys with
their weapons and rocks in hand, stand ready."

Shlok 37: As directed by Raghavana, Neela the commander-in-chief and the foremost of the
monkeys, ordered the monkey-troops suitably.

Shlok 38: Then, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Hanuma and Angada looking like mountains, reached the
gate, taking the mountian-tops.

Shlok 39: On hearing Rama's words, the fearless monkeys started their operation. The heroic
monkeys began to torment the enemy-troops with uplifted trees.

Shlok 40: That terrific army of monkeys, with uplifted rocks and tress in their hands, shone
like a big collection of gigantic clouds, hanging close to a mountain.



SARGA 62
------------------------------

[Text] Kumbhakarna enters the abode of Ravana and sees his worried brother sitting in
Pushpaka, a self-moving aerial car. Kumbhakarna asks Ravana about the nature of work to be done by
him and whether he has to kill anyone. Ravana replies that Rama has come with troops of monkeys
including Sugreeva, after crossing the ocean by a bridge, to wage a battle Ravana requests
Kumbhakarna to show his terrible prowess in killing all the adversaries in battle.

Shlok 1: That Kumbhakarna of great prowess and the foremost, having full of intoxicating
drowsiness, marched along the king's highway, full of royal dignity.

Shlok 2: Then, that Kumbhakarna, who was very difficult to be conquered, accompanied by
thousands of demons, sallied forth, covered with a shower of flowers from the houses (lining the
way).

Shlok 3: He saw Ravana's abode, covered with golden grilled windows, spacious and looking
beautiful, like a shining sun.

Shlok 4: Entering Ravana's palace, like the sun entering a mass of clouds, Kumbhakarna then
saw from of distance his brother seated on a throne, as Indra saw Brahma perched on his seat.

Shlok 5: While going to his brother's palace, that Kumbhakarna, accompanied by troops of
demons, caused the earth to shake with his stamping strides.

Shlok 6: Reaching his brother's house and entering the inner apartment, Kumbhakarna saw his
worried brother sitting in Pushpaka, a self-moving aerial car.

Shlok 7: On seeing Kumbhakarna who arrived there, Ravana then quickly rose up from his seat,
delighted and brought him nearer to his side.

Shlok 8: Then, the mighty Kumbhakarna having offered salutation to the feet of his brother
sitting on a sofa, asked him, "What is to be done?"

Shlok 9: Rising up from his seat, Ravana embraced him. That Kumbhakarna, who was thus
embraced and made happy by his brother, occupied an auspicious, charming and excellent seat.

Shlok 10: Resting on that seat, the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his blood-shot eyes in anger,
spoke to Ravana as follows:

Shlok 11: "O king! For what purpose have I been woken up by you, with effort? Tell me from
whom is the danger for you here and who is to be killed."

Shlok 12: Ravana, with his eyes rolling with annoyance, spoke to Kumbhakarna, his brother, who
was there with anger (as follows):

Shlok 13: "O mighty Kumbhakarna! You slept for a long period. You, who were fast asleep, do
not know about the fear created by Rama in me."

Shlok 14: "This Rama, the son of Dasaratha, a strong man along with Sugreeva, having crossed
the ocean, is cutting short our race."

Shlok 15: "Alas! See! Coming happily by a bridge, the forests and groves have been covered
with an ocean full of monkeys."

Shlok 16- 17: "The monkeys killed very important demons in battle. I do not envisage, in any way,
the destroyable of monkeys on the battle-field. It seems the monkeys were not even defeated at any
time before, in a combat."

Shlok 18: "O mighty Kumbhakarna! Such a danger has arisen. You have to help us now. Get them
destroyed now. You have been woken up solely for that purpose."

Shlok 19: "Rescuing me, whose treasury has become completely diminished, you protect this city
of Lanka, where only the children and the aged are left over."

Shlok 20: "O the great armed Kumbhakarna. For the sake of your brother, perform this act,
which is very difficult to do. O brother, the annihilator of enemies! In this way, I did not
request anyone ever before."

Shlok 21: "I have a great respect and affection towards you. O the foremost of demons! For
several times, in battles between gods and demons, you conquered the celestials and demons, after
attacking them in the battle."

Shlok 22: "O Kumbhakarna of terrible prowess! Therefore, show your entire prowess. There is
indeed no one, in the entire beings, who is equal to you in strength."

Shlok 23: "O Kumbhakarna, delighting in war and feeling affection for relatives! Perform this
excellent act, which is dear and beneficial to me, as per your liking. Blow away the army of
adversaries by your vital power, as an autumnal cloud is blown away by a high-rising wind."



SARGA 63
------------------------------

[Text] Kumbhakarna abuses Ravana for his utter disregard of the earlier advices given by his 
well-wishers like Vibhishana, due to his sheer arrogance and neglect of the scriptures which enumerate 
the king's duties. Ravana replies to Kumbhakarna that bygone is a bygone and asks him to proceed to 
the battle-front. Then, Kumbhakarna reassures Ravana and promises him that all the adversaries would 
be destroyed by him in the ensuing battle.

Shlok 1: Hearing the lamentation of Ravana, Kumbhakarna laughed at a full volume and spoke as 
follows:

Shlok 2: "The same bad consequence, which was imagined by us earlier while taking the final decision 
after our consultation, is faced by you now, due to your utter disregard of the words spoken by your 
well-wishers."

Shlok 3: "How a doer of wicked deeds indeed falls into damnation, so also a punishment for your 
sinful act has indeed reached your fast."

Shlok 4: "O emperor! This course of action was not excepted by you at first. You did not conceive 
this consequence, only because of your sheer arrogance of power."

Shlok 5: "He who, abiding in power, performs duties to be done earlier at a later stage and duties 
to be done later, at an early stage, does not know what is a right course and what is a wrong course."

Shlok 6: "Action done perversely, regardless of space and time, get spoiled like offering oblations 
without properly making the fire well-prepared."

Shlok 7: "He, who acts according to an agreement done with his counsellors, considering three 
types of duties*, by harassing five types of means**, moves along a right course."

[Commentary] *1). Conclusion of peace through conciliation. 2) acceptance of allegiance through 
gift. 3) invasion, as a method of coercion. **1) The method of initiating an actions. 2) Personality 
and material to be worked upon. 3) Time and place of action. 4) Provision against mischance and 5) chances 
of success.

Shlok 8: "A king who wishes to execute am agreement as per law, understands it through his own 
intellect as well as the counsellors and discovers it through his friends, is on a right course."

Shlok 9: "O king of demons! A man resorts to virtue or worldly gain or pleasure or all the three 
together or a twin combination of virtue and worldly gain or virtue and pleasure or worldly gain and 
pleasure or worldly gain and pleasure, according to an appointed time*."

[Commentary] *The scriptures lay down that virtue should be pursued in the morning, worldly gain 
in the afternoon and sensuous pleasure at night. As an alternative, one is called upon to pursue

Shlok 10: "That sovereign king or crown prince, who, having heard which one is the best out of 
these three but does not keep it in mind, his extensive learning would be in vain."

Shlok 11- 12: "O the foremost of demons! Whosoever deliberates with his counsellors and resorts to 
an act of with his counsellors and resorts to an act of bestowing gifts or conciliation or sowing dissension 
at appropriate occasion or exhibits valour or resorts to them all together or takes recourse to both 
right action and the reverse of it at the right time or pursues virtue or worldly gain or pleasure at 
the appropriate time, that intelligent person never confronts a misfortune in this world."

Shlok 13: "A sovereign has to do an act here, looking into his welfare as a consequence along with 
his counsellors who make their subsistence by their intelligence and who understand the true state of 
the things."

Shlok 14: "Men with brutal ideas, who are initiated in discussions, aspire to tell haughty things, 
without fully knowing the precepts of the scriptures."

Shlok 15: "The words spoken by those who did not know the scriptures, who do not recollect the 
books dealing with practical life and who covet for abundant wealth are not to be implemented."

Shlok 16: "Those men who talk with audacity, some inimical things in a friendly way, are to be 
kept out of deliberations, as they certainly spoil the work to be done."

Shlok 17: "Some counsellors, colluding with some learned adversaries, spoil their king and make 
them do wrong deeds."

Shlok 18: "The king should make-out those ministers who have been transformed by the enemy to their 
side (through bribery and other things) and are enemies though looking like friends, through their conduct 
when a final decision is being taken after deliberation."

Shlok 19: "Outsiders find out the fickleness of a ruler, who is led away by false appearances and 
quickly performs the acts, as birds discover the hole (made by the arrow of Skanda, the commander-in-chief 
of gods) in the Kruancha mountain."

Shlok 20: "A king who disregards an enemy and does not protect himself, indeed faces disappointing 
occurrences and would be removed from his position."

Shlok 21: "That advice which was tendered to you earlier by vibhishana is beneficial to us. Do 
whatever you wish to do."

Shlok 22: On hearing those words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana, on his part, twisted his eye-brows in 
anger and spoke the following words:

Shlok 23: "Why are you advising me like a venerable great teacher? What is the use in getting wearied 
of your speech? Let a work, most befitting of time, be performed."

Shlok 24: "Now, it is a waste to tell again of that act which was wrongly done before, either by 
mistake or by an illusion of mind or by taking shelter in strength and prowess."

Shlok 25: "Let whatever be appropriate at this moment be thought of now. Wise men do not repent 
over the past. Past is indeed but the past."

Shlok 26: "If you have affection indeed for me or if you discover your own prowess and if you think 
it fit in your heart that my work is to be done very much, you nullify the hardship, born out of my 
wicked conduct, by your prowess."

Shlok 27: "He who rescues an afflicted soul, whose fortune is ruined, he is the real friend. He 
who is ready at hand to help those who have deviated from the right course, is a kinsman."

Shlok 28: Thereupon, hearing those deeply harsh words spoken by Ravana and understanding that he 
is quite enraged, Kumbhakarna spoke slowly and smoothly.

Shlok 29: Observing that his brother is highly perturbed and excited of his senses, Kumbhakarna, 
while consoling him, gently spoke the following words:

Shlok 30- 31: "O king, the annihilator of adversaries! Listen to my words attentively. O emperor of 
demons! Enough of your giving way to the anguish. Abandoning your anger completely, you ought to be 
your normal self again."

Shlok 32: "O king! Until I live, this idea should not be formed in your mind. I shall destroy him, 
for whose account, you are feeling anguished."

Shlok 33: "O king! In whatever situation you are placed, I have to give certainly a good advice 
to you. I gave this advice, because of our relation and brotherly affection."

Shlok 34: "See that which is to be done and this juncture, out of affection by a brother, viz. 
the destruction of adversaries in battle, will be done by me."

Shlok 35: "See today, O mighty armed king, the fleeing army of monkeys and Rama along with his 
brother being killed by me in the fore-front of the battle-field."

Shlok 36: "O the mighty armed! Be happy by seeing that Rama's head, which I shall bring today from 
the battle. Let Seetha be unhappy."

Shlok 37: "Let all those demons in Lanka, whose relatives have died in battle, witness the death 
of the most beloved Rama today."

Shlok 38: "Today, I shall do the act of wiping off tears of demons, who have been afflicted with 
grief and lamenting because of the destruction of their relatives in combat by the adversaries."

Shlok 39: "See today in battle, the mountain-like Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, looking like a 
cloud illuminated by the sun, thrown about, dissipated."

Shlok 40: "O faultless Ravana! Why are you agitated now, when you are being consoled by those demons 
and by me, who are desirous of killing Rama?"

Shlok 41: "O king of demons! Rama will indeed kill you, only after killing me. On that account, 
I do not regret for myself."

Shlok 42: "O Ravana, having unequal prowess and the annihilator of enemies! You can command me, 
even now, as you wish. No other person need be sought, for a dispatch to the battle."

Shlok 43: "I can destroy your enemies, who have a great strength. I can engage in combat with all 
those persons, whether he is Indra or Yama or the fire-god to the wind-god or even Varuna."

Shlok 44: "Indra also gets frightened of me, having a mountain-sized body wielding a sharpened 
pike, having pointed tusks and even as I roar."

Shlok 45: "Even otherwise, no one can stand alive in front of me, who is even weaponless and smashing 
the enemies by me strength alone."

Shlok 46: "Without using a javelin or a mace or a sword or sharp arrows, I myself, on getting excited, 
can kill even Indra, with my bare hands."

Shlok 47: "If Rama today survives even after facing the rapid blows of my fists, then my flood 
of arrows will drink the blood of Rama."

Shlok 48: "O king! When I exist, why do you suffer from anxiety? Here, I am ready to sally forth 
for the destruction of your enemies."

Shlok 49- 50: "Be free from the terrific fear of Rama. In the battle, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, 
the mighty Sugreeva and even Hanuma, by whom the city of Lanka was burnt off and the demons were killed."

Shlok 51: "I shall devour the monkeys in battle, which is near at hand. I wish to contribute a 
tremendous and extraordinary reputation for you."

Shlok 52: 'O king! If you have a fear for Indra or even for Brahma, I shall remove it then, as 
the sun removes darkness of the night. When I am enraged, even celestials will lay down on the floor."

Shlok 53: "I shall extinguish even Yama the god of death. I shall devour the fire-god. I shall 
cause the sun along with the stars to fall asunder on the floor."

Shlok 54: "I shall kill Indra. I shall drink away the ocean. I shall crush the mountains into a 
powder. I shall tear up the earth."

Shlok 55- 56: "Let all the living beings, being devoured from all sides see today the prowess of Kumbhakarna, 
who slept for a long time. The entire heaven is not enough for my food."

Shlok 57: "I am going to bring you happiness, conferring you a delight by the destroyal of Rama. 
Having killed Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the chiefs of army of monkeys."

Shlok 58: "O king! You make merry today and drink wine. Throw away your agony and perform your 
usual duties. While I send Rama to the world of Yama, the god of death, Seetha will be subservient to 
your after a log time."

[Text] Mahodara excitedly speaks to Kumbhakarna about the true character of virtue, worldly
gain as well as sensuous pleasure in a person and supports Ravana for his actions. He advises
Kumbhakarna not to go single-handed to fight with mighty Rama, but to take the army with him.
Mahodara then suggests to Ravana a strategy to fulfill his purpose without a combat.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words spoken by the mighty Kumbhakarna of colossal body and large
arms, Mahodara spoke as follows:

Shlok 2: "O Kumbhakarna! Though born in a good race, you are audacious, having the perception
of an ordinary man as also arrogant. You are unable to know the right to be done at all times."

Shlok 3: "O Kumbhakarna! It is not that the king does not know about the prudent and the
imprudent conducts. Due to childishness and audacity, you, on your part, are craving merely to
talk."

Shlok 4: "The king of demons, knowing about apportioning of place and time, understands the
subject about strengthening and mining (of relationships) as well as his own position and the
position of others."

Shlok 5: "What would a wise man attempt to do that which cannot be achieved by a man of
ordinary intellect, though strong, does not sever his elders?"

Shlok 6: "You are speaking as though virtue, wealth and pleasure are dwelling separately (in
water-tight compartments). By their very nature, there is no accurate description to know those
things."

Shlok 7: "Action alone is indeed the means to get all the consequences. Even sinful acts
spring up into a fruit of prosperity!"

Shlok 8: "Acts instrumental to virtue and wealth as well as other acts (instrumental to
injustice and non-value) have just the prosperity as their fruit. But, acts instrumental to
injustice and non-value gain the fruit of offence of omission."

Shlok 9: Living beings reap the fruit of good actions in this and in the other world.
However, he who remains diligently devoted to actions with a view to attaining sensuous pleasure
enjoys blessing even in this life."

Shlok 10: "In such a situation, this act of pursuit of sensuous pleasure has been cherished in
his heart by the king and was approved by us. What violation is there in doing this daring act
against the enemy?"

Shlok 11: "Regarding the reason which you have adduced for marching all alone for the
encounter, I shall tell you what is irrelevant and not so good."

Shlok 12: "How will you conquer, single-handed, that Rama by whom several mighty demons were
destroyed in Janasthana earlier."

Shlok 13: "Are you not seeing those frightened demons (though highly energetic) who are now
staying in the City, but who were earlier conquered by Rama in Janasthana?"

Shlok 14: "Though you know that Rama, the son of Dsasratha, is like an enraged lion, you wish
to awaken a serpent, who is sleeping."

Shlok 15: "Who would be competent to approach that Rama, who is forever shining with a
splendour, dangerous to catch-up and as unbearable as death?"

Shlok 16: "Standing face-to-face with that enemy is all remaining in doubt. Going there
single-handed does not indeed find favour with me."

Shlok 17: "Having lost his advantage, who would feel inclined to reduce to submission, an
enemy, who is rich in advantage and determined to lay down his life, as an ordinary person?"

Shlok 18: "O Kumbhakarna, the foremost among the demons! How do you wish to combat with Rama,
with whom none in the human beings is equal and who is equal of Indra and the sun?"

Shlok 19: Having thus spoken to the enraged Kumbhakarna, Mahodara on his part spoke as
follows, in the midst of demons, to Ravana, who made the people cry.

Shlok 20: "Why are you delaying further, after having captured Seetha already? If you do so
wish, Seetha will be submissive to you."

Shlok 21: "Some strategy has been discovered by me, as a means of bringing her round. If it is
found agreeable to your intellect, then listen to it.

Shlok 22: "Announce (by a beat of drum in the city-streets) that myself, Dvijihva, Samhraadi,
Kumbhakarna and Vitardana these five demons are setting out for the battle to kill Rama."

Shlok 23: "Thereupon, having gone to the battle field deliberately, we shall give him a fight.
If we conquer your enemies, there is no need for any strategies to us."

Shlok 24: "Otherwise, if our enemy survives, we, who have engaged in the fight, then shall
implement the plan which was resolved by us in the mind."

Shlok 25: "Moistened with blood on having our bodies torn with arrows marked with the name of
Rama engraved on them, we shall come back here from the battle."

Shlok 26: Saying "Rama as well as Lakshmana has been devoured by us", we shall clasp your
feet. You fully grant our desire."

Shlok 27: "O king! Then, have it proclaimed by beating of trumpets in the entire city, on the
back of an elephant, that Rama has been killed along with his brother and his army."

Shlok 28: "O annihilator of enemies! Becoming pleased for the name-sake, arrange to bestow on
your servants, objects of enjoyment, other desired objects and gold."

Shlok 29: "Then, present garlands, garments and cosmetics to champions as well as abundant
gifts to other warriors. Drink yourself delighted."

Shlok 30- 31: "When this thick rumour has gone to all sides that Rama along with his companions
have been devoured by the demons and you approach Seetha in private and restoring her to confidence
and even conciliating her, tempt her with gold and grain, as well as luxuries and precious
tones."

Shlok 32: "By this false pretence, creating fear and anguish, Seetha who thinks she lost her
husband, will submit reluctantly to your will."

Shlok 33: "Believing that her charming husband is destroyed, Seetha from her hopelessness and
feminine feeling of flexibility, will come to your will."

Shlok 34: "Seetha, who grew up with comfort, who is deserving of happiness; but emaciated with
grief, knowing that her happiness depends on you, will by all means come near to you."

Shlok 35: "After contemplating very well, I have conveyed like this. As soon as you see Rama,
a calamity will happen. While you stay here itself without fighting, you will obtain a great
benefit of happiness. Do not become restless."

Shlok 36: "O king! An emperor who conquers his enemies without losing his army, without
meeting with danger and without a combat will obtain for long, a great fame, merit, prosperity and
glory."

[Text] Kumbhakarna rebukes Mahodara for rendering a wrong advice to Ravana. He asserts
Ravana, saying that he will annihilate Rama in battle. Ravana gets pleased and orders Kumbhakarna
to wipe off the monkeys together with Rama and Lakshmana in battle. Then, Ravana arranged for
ornamentation of the various limbs of Kumbhakarna with various types of jewellery, before sending
him to the battle. As Kumbhakarna sallies forth to the battle, several bad omens appear on all
sides. Kumbhakarna disregards these portents and marches ahead for the battle. Seeing the colossal
form of Kumbhakarna, all the monkeys get frightened and take to their heels.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of Mahodara, Kumbhakarna rebuked him and then spoke to his
brother, Ravana, the chief of demons (as follows):

Shlok 2: "By annihilation of that evil-minded Rama, I will wipe-off your terrifc fear today.
Be happy, indeed without any enmity."

Shlok 3: "Warriors do not roar in vain as waterless clouds. Hear my roar, only on completion
of my said task in battle."

Shlok 4: "Warriors do not indulge in eulogizing themselves. They do difficult acts, without a
show."

Shlok 5: "O Mahodara! Your words may be agreeable to those kings who are confused, who fancy
themselves as the learned, and who themselves are stupid."

Shlok 6: "You are all cowards in battle. You always speak pleasantly and go according to the
wishes of the king. You, as such, have spoiled all the undertakings."

Shlok 7: "Having access to this king, who has friends merely for a name-sake as also behaving
unfriendly, the treasury got depleted, the army destroyed and king alone is left the Lanka."

Shlok 8: "Intent on conquering the enemy, I sally for the battle today to set right your
imprudent policy."

Shlok 9: Hearing the words of the intellectual Kumbhakarna, Ravana the king of demons,
bursting into laughter, replied as follows:

Shlok 10: "O dear brother, well-versed in the art of war-fare! This Mahodara is frightened of
Rama. There is no doubt. He is not indeed inclined of a war."

Shlok 11: "O Kumbhakarna! None is equal to you in friendship and strength, in my eyes. You
march to the battlefield for destroying the enemies and for achieving victory."

Shlok 12: "O destroyer of enemies! You, who were sleeping, were awakened by me, for the
purpose of destroying the enemies. This is indeed a grand time for our demons."

Shlok 13: "Therefore, go like Yama the god of death, by taking a dart and a noose in your
hand. Devour the monkeys and the princes whose splendour is like that of the sun."

Shlok 14: "By seeing your very form, the monkeys will run away. The hearts of Rama and
Lakshmana will get broken asunder."

Shlok 15: Ravana, the king of demons, having a great energy, thus speaking to the mighty
Kumbhakarna, thought himself as though he was born again.

Shlok 16: The king, knowing the strength and prowess of Kumbhakarna, was delighted and became
as bright as the moon.

Shlok 17: Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some others
escaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as though
they were dead.

Shlok 18: Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, speedily took up a sharp spike fully made
of iron, adorned with pure gold and splendidly shining.

Shlok 19- 20: Taking hold of that large spike tinted with the blood of enemies, shining like
Indra's thunderbolt and equally heavy, capable of tormenting celestials, demons, Gandharvas, the
celestial musicians, Yakshas a class of demi-gods and Nagas the celestial serpents, wreathed in
garlands of crimson flowers with excessive splendour and emitting flames by itself naturally,
Kumbhakarna of great brilliance spoke to Ravana the following words:

Shlok 21: "Let this large army stay back here. I shall go all alone. Being angry with hunger,
I shall devour those monkeys now."

Shlok 22: Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana said, "Go along with army, with their
spikes and hammers in hand."

Shlok 23: "The monkeys, with their huge bodies, valiant, with a much determination and with
their teeth, will destroy anyone who is either alone or off one's guard."

Shlok 24: "Therefore, go along with your troops as a person who is very difficult to be
assaulted. Destroy the entire enemy-side, which in inimical to our demons."

Shlok 25: Rising up swiftly from his throne, Ravana endowed with a great energy, then placed
around the neck of Kumbhakarna, a necklace studded with a course of jewels.

Shlok 26: Ravana placed on the person of Kumbhakarna, armlets, rings, excellent jewellery and
a handsome chain.

Shlok 27: Ravana arranged for ornamentation of his limbs with beautiful and sweet-smelling
garlands as well as ear-rings to his ears.

Shlok 28: Kumbhakarna with large ears, adorned with golden armlets and bracelets worn on his
upper arms along with ornament for his breast, shone like fire, well-fed with oblations.

Shlok 29: With a large, black and shining string worn round his loins, he was looking like
Mount Mandara encircled by a serpent at the time of churning the ambrosia.

Shlok 30: Secured with a golden armour, carrying a great load, impenetrable by weapons and as
if blazing with its own splendour with flashing like lightning, Kumbhakarna shone as a king of
Mountains, enveloped by clouds at sunset.

Shlok 31: Adorned with all ornaments to all his limbs and with a spike in his hand, that demon
shone like Narayana, the all-embracing Lord, enthusiastic to take the three long strides (which
were meant to cover the entire universe).

Shlok 32: Embracing his brother and even circumambulating him, the mighty Kumbhakarna sallied
forth, after offering salutation to him by bowing down to him respectfully.

Shlok 33: Ravana sent off the mighty Kumbhakarna, having a colossal body, who was then
sallying forth, with a great sound (of drums and musical instruments) and with laudable
benedictions.

Shlok 34: With loud sounds of counches and kettle-drums, with an army wielding excellent
weapons, with elephants, with horses and with chariots making sounds of clouds, mighty charioteers
accompanied him who was the foremost among the charioteers.

Shlok 35: Those demons followed that terrific and mighty Kumbhakarna, mounting on serpents,
camels donkeys, lions, elephants, wild beasts and birds.

Shlok 36: That Kumbhakarna, the enemy of ogres and celestials, wielding a sharp spike in his
hand, while sallying forth, over whose head a parasol was held and drink and intoxicated by the
smell of blood.

Shlok 37: Many demons, possessing a great energy and great strength, with terrific forms and
fearful eyes, as also wielding weapons in their hands, accompanied him as foot-soldiers.

Shlok 38- 39: The demons followed, with their red hot eyes, large colossal bodies resembling a
mass of collyrium in hue, lifting up spikes, swords, sharp axes, javelins, iron rods, maces,
mallets, enormous trunks of palmyrah trees to be hurled at and difficult to be met.

Shlok 40- 41: Then, that Kumbhakarna, of a great splendour and a great strength, assuming another
body of a formidable and terrific form, with a breadth of a hundred bows and six hundred bows in
height, with his eyes resembling the wheels of a cart, looking like a huge mountain and terrible to
look at, sallied forth.

Shlok 42: Kumbhakarna with his colossal body and a huge mouth, looking like a scorched hill,
approaching the demons and laughing loudly, spoke as follows:

Shlok 43: "Charged with anger, I shall burn up those troops of the foremost of monkeys, in
lots today, as a flash of fire would burn up the moths."

Shlok 44: "The monkeys who are in the habit of roaming about in the woods, have not offended
me of their own accord. That race of monkeys serves as an embellishment for the urban gardens in a
city like ours."

Shlok 45: "Rama, together with Lakshmana, is the root-cause for the attack on our city. If he
is killed, all will be destroyed. Therefore, I shall kill that Rama in battle."

Shlok 46: While Kumbhakarna was speaking in that way, the demons made a very terrific noise,
as though they were agitating the ocean.

Shlok 47: As that intelligent Kumbhakarna was sallying forth quickly for the battle, omens of
terrific patterns appeared on all sides.

Shlok 48: Clouds, ashy in colour like asses, combined with meteors and strokes of lightning
appeared. Even the earth trembled, together with its oceans and forests.

Shlok 49: Jackals of terrific form howled with flaming morsels in their mouths and birds
twirled in circles from right to left.

Shlok 50: A vulture descended on the spike of Kumbhakarna, as he was sallying forth along the
road. His left eye twitched and his left arm throbbed.

Shlok 51: Then, a blazing meteor fell down with a dreadful noise. Even the sun became
lusterless and the wind was not blowing comfortably.

Shlok 52: Disregarding those great portents indicated, causing the hair to stand erect,
Kumbhakarna on his part marched on, driven by the power of fate.

Shlok 53: Kumbhakarna, looking like a mountain, traversing the rampart with his feet alone,
saw a wonderful army of monkeys, looking similar to a thick coverage of clouds.

Shlok 54: Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the excellent among demons, looking equal to a mountain,
the monkeys then ran away to all directions, as clouds are driven away by the wind.

Shlok 55: Looking towards that highly fierce army of monkeys, running away to different
quarters, as a net-work of broken clouds, that Kumbhakarna with the hue of a black cloud, highly
rejoiced, repeatedly emitted a roar-like thunder.

Shlok 56: Hearing his terrific roar, similar to the rumbling of a cloud in the sky, many of
those monkeys fell down on the ground, like Sal trees cut-up by the roots.

Shlok 57: Wielding a large iron rod for the destroyable of the enemies, that gigantic
Kumbhakarna looked like Yama the lord of death armed with a rod of punishment, waiting upon him as
his attendant at the time of dissolution of the world and caused a great terrific fear to the
troops of monkeys.



SARGA 66
------------------------------

[Text] Seeing Kumbhakarna coming with his colossal body and emitting a tremendous roar, the
monkeys scare away. Angada reassures the monkeys, who then return to the battle field to resume
fight. When the monkeys start attacking Kumbhakarna, the latter crushes some monkeys with rage.
Then again, the monkeys get frightened and run away in different directions. Angada then restores
the monkeys to confidence once more and all the monkeys stand awaiting the command of Angada.

Shlok 1: That mighty Kumbhakarna, with his colossal body resembling the peak of a mountain,
having crossed the rampart, sallied forth from the city.

Shlok 2: Kumbhakarna emitted a roar, making the sea to reverberate, causing the mountains to
quake and drowning the thunder-claps, as it were.

Shlok 3: Seeing that demons of terrific eyes who could not be destroyed either by Indra the
lord of celestials or by Yama the lord of death or by Varuna the god of water, the monkeys ran
away.

Shlok 4: Seeing them running away, Angada the prince spoke to Nala, Neela, Gavaksha and the
mighty Kumuda as follows:

Shlok 5: "Where do you go, forgetting your own dignities as also nobilities of birth and
trembling with fear like common monkeys?"

Shlok 6: "O auspicious monkeys! Please return! Why do you so fully guard your lives? This
demon is not competent for a combat. He is merely a great toy of terror."

Shlok 7: "O monkeys! By our prowess, we shall destroy this giant toy produced by demons. Come
back!"

Shlok 8: Reconciling themselves with some difficulty, the monkeys, from all sides, assembled
together at a place and snatching some trees, the monkeys for their part, towards the
battle-field.

Shlok 9: Like elephants in rut, those monkeys, having came back, hurriedly hit Kumbhakarna,
very much enraged as they were.

Shlok 10: The mighty Kumbhakarna, though assaulted with lofty mountain-tops, rocks and trees
with blossoms at their ends, stood unshaken.

Shlok 11: Many rocks, fallen on his limbs, got burst into pieces. The trees, with blossoms at
their ends, were broken and fell shattered on the floor.

Shlok 12: Kumbhakarna too, very much enraged, crushed the ranks of monkeys though they were
greatly energetic, with his extreme exertion even as a rising fire would consume the woods.

Shlok 13: Many of the foremost among the monkeys lay on the ground, bathed in blood as they
were, fallen like trees with crimson flowers, when tossed up by the demon.

Shlok 14: Some monkeys, while jumping and running away, did not look back. Some fell in the
ocean. Some inhabited the sky.

Shlok 15: While that demon was killing some warriors of monkeys playfully, some others ran
away by the same route, by which they earlier crossed the ocean.

Shlok 16: While some monkeys becoming pale-faced due to fear, inhabited the mounds and the low
grounds, some bears ascended the trees. Some escaped to a hill.

Shlok 17: Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some others
escaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as though
they were dead.

Shlok 18: Seeing those monkeys disorderly retreated, Angada spoke these words, "Stay. We shall
carry on the battle. Come back."

Shlok 19: "I do not catch sight of any place for you, who have retreated, even if you roam
over the entire earth. Let all of you come back. Why do you safeguard your lives?"

Shlok 20: "O valiant monkeys, moving without hindrances! Your wives, seeing you running away
leaving your weapos aside, will mock at you. It is indeed a death for those who lived well."

Shlok 21- 22: "All of us are born in distinguished races; which are well developed. Where to you
go frightened, like ordinary monkeys? As you are running away with fear, leaving all your valour,
you are indeed unworthy of honour."

Shlok 23: "Where did those boasting words of you melt away, in which you highly projected
yourself in front of the people just before coming for the battle?

Shlok 24: "The cowards, who survive even after being reproached, have to hear slanders from
the people. Let the path trodden by the good people be followed. Let your fear be abandoned."

Shlok 25: "If our longevity is short, we shall lie down, being killed by the enemies, on the
earth and reach the realm of Brahma (residence of pious spirits), which is difficult to be attained
by bad warriors."

Shlok 26: "O monkeys! We shall obtain glory by killing our enemies in battle or if killed on
the other hand, we shall enjoy the heaven, attained by the warriors."

Shlok 27: "Coming face to face with Rama, Kumbhakarna will not go back alive, any more than a
moth meeting a blazing fire."

Shlok 28: "If we, in large numbers, who are intended to fight, are conquered by one person
alone and if we protect our lives by running away, our glory will undergo a damage."

Shlok 29: Then, those fleeing monkeys spoke the following words, which were contemptible by
the warriors, to that valiant Angada, who was adorneed with golden armlets.

Shlok 30: "For us, it is enough of this terrific battle with Kumbhakarna, the demon. It is not
the proper time to stay back but it is to time to go away. Life is indeed dear to us."

Shlok 31: Seeing that terrific Kumbhakarna coming with his dreadful eyes, all those commanders
of monkey-troops, speaking words only thus far, scattered in all directions.

Shlok 32: Thereafter, with the coaxing words and inferential arguments by Angada, all those
fleeing commanders of monkeys turned back.

Shlok 33: Having been cheered up by the intellectual Angada, all those commanders of the
army-troops stood awaiting his command.

Shlok 34: Rishabha, Sharabha, Mainda, Dhumra, Neela, Kumuda, sushena, Gavaksha, Rambha, Tara
and more particularly Dvipada, Panasa and hanuma marched ahead very quickly, with their faces
turned towards the battle.



SARGA 67
------------------------------

[Text] Restored to confidence by Angada, all the monkeys return to the battle-field.
Dvivida, a leader of the monkeys hurls a mountain towards Kumbhakarna, but it misses the target and
falls on horses, elephants and chariots of the enemy. Dvivida hurls another mountain and some
demons are killed. Hanuma strikes Kumbhakarna with a large mountain-peak and injures him severely.
In reply, Kumbhakarna strikes on Hanuma's chest with his spike. Then, Kumbhakarna strikes other
monkey-chiefs who attack him. Thousands of monkeys then ascend Kumbhakarna's body and encounters
him with their nails, fists, teeth and arms. In response, Kumbhakarna destroys all those monkeys
with his spike. When Angada, the leader of the monkeys, attacks Kumbhakarna, the latter strikes
Angada violently and Angada falls unconscious. Then, Kumbhakarna begins his attack on Sugreeva.
But, Sugreeva strikes Kumbhakarna's chest with a mountain, but the mountain only breaks into
pieces. When Kumbhakarna throws his spike towards Sugreeva in retaliation, Hanuma stops it on the
way and breaks it off. Then, Kumbhakarna hurls a mountian-crust on Sugreeva to make him unconscious
and takes him away on his shoulders to Lanka. When Sugreeva regains consciousness, he tears off the
ears and nose of Kumbhakarna with his sharp nails and teeth. In relation, Kumbhakarna thren
Sugreeva down and crushed him. Then Sugreeva bounces into the air and gets re united with Rama.
Kumbhakarna thereafter takes his hammer and begins to attack the monkeys and bears. Then, Lakshmana
starts to attack Kumbhakarna with his arrows. But, Kumbhakarna appreciates the valour of Lakshmana
and proceeds towards Rama to fight with him. Rama discharges some arrows with 'Roundra' spell
towards Kumbhakarna. Those arrows disappear into Kumbhakarna's chest and make him weapon-less. In
retaliation, Kumbhakarna hurls a mountain-peak towards Rama and even before the mountain-peak
reaches Rama, it was split up into pieces by the arrows released by Rama. Thereupon, on the advice
given by Lakshmana, all the monkeys climb straight upon Kumbhakarna's body. Kumbhakarna shakes them
off with violence. Then, Rama employs a great missile and chops off one arm of Kumbhakarna. When
Kumbhakarna with an uprooted tree in his arm, retailiates by running towards Rama, the latter with
an arrow, presided over by Indra, hurls it on the former and chops off the second arm of
Kumbhakarna, Rama then chops off the feet of Kumbhakarna with his arrows and finally slashes off
his head.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of Angada, all those large-bodied monkeys who came back, having
arrived at a firm resolution, were waiting for the battle.

Shlok 2- 3: Restored to confidence by the words of the mighty Angada, those monkeys, whose
energy was well-augmented and prowess well-elevated, restored to a thrill of rapture and as they
were determined to die, marched forward to fight. Ready to abandon their lives, they were engaged
in a tumultuous battle.

Shlok 4: Lifting up trees and very large mountain-rocks, the large-bodied monkeys thereupon
briskly ran towards Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 5: The mighty and valiant Kumbhakarna, who got very much enraged, lifting a mace and
frightening his enemies, diffused them on all sides.

Shlok 6: Seven hundred, eight hundred and thousands of monkeys struck by Kumbhakarna, lay
scattered on the ground.

Shlok 7: That highly enraged Kumbhakarna, putting in his mount, (as many as) sixteen or eight
or ten or even twenty or thirty monkeys by his hands and devouring them like. Garuda the mythical
bird devouring the serpents in lots, ran about the battle-field.

Shlok 8: Restored to confidence with difficulty, the monkeys assembling together from all
sides, stood in the battle-front, with trees and rocks in their hands.

Shlok 9: Pulling out a mountain and looking like a hanging cloud, Dvivida the foremost among
the monkeys, ran towards Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain-peak.

Shlok 10: Dvivida, springing up, hurled that mountain towards Kumbhakarna. Even without
reaching the colossal bodied Kumbhakarna, it however fell on his army.

Shlok 11: That excellent mountain crushed the horses, elephants and the chariots. Another
mountain-top, when hurled, crushed the other demons.

Shlok 12: Struck by the jerk of the mountain, that great battle-field of demons, with its
horses and charioteers killed, became dampened with blood.

Shlok 13: The demons who fight from the chariots, with their terrific roar, at once discarded
the heads of the clamouring chiefs of monkeys, with their arrows, which were resembling the god of
death at the time of universal dissolution.

Shlok 14: Uprooting large trees, the mighty monkeys too began to destroy the chariots, horses,
Camels and demons.

Shlok 15: Staying in the sky, Hanuma showered mountain-tops, rocks and various types of trees
on Kumbhakarna's head.

Shlok 16: The mighty Kumbhakarna broken those mountain-tops and shattered the torrent of trees
with his spike.

Shlok 17: Then, taking the dreadful spike in his hand, Kumbhakarna ran towards that terrific
army of monkeys. Taking a mountain-peak in his hands, Hanuma stood in front of the approaching
Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 18: The enraged Hanuma struck with violence Kumbhakarna, who was endowed with a
magnificent body and looking like the most elevated mountain. Thus attacked by Hanuma, Kumbhakarna
was stumbled with a sprinkling of blood and with his limbs succulent with flesh.

Shlok 19: Holding firmly the spike, which was bright as lightning and looking like a blazing
mountain-peak, Kumbhakarna struck Hanuma on his chest, as Guha (the son of Shiva) struck Krauncha
mountain with his powerful javelin.

Shlok 20: That Hanuma, struck in his broad chest by the spike in that great combat, was highly
perturbed and while vomiting blood from his mouth, awfully roared like the sound of thunderous
clouds at the time of dissolution of the world.

Shlok 21: Looking at the perturbed Hanuma, all the troops of demons then suddenly shouted with
rejoice. The monkeys, on their part, felt restless and being oppressed with fear, ran away from the
battle-field.

Shlok 22: Thereupon, cheering up the army and stopping them, the mighty Neela then hurled a
mountain-top on the intellectual Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 23: Seeing that mountain-top befalling on him, Kumbhakarna then struck it with his fist.
By that strike of the fist, that mountain-top was burst into pieces and fallen down on the ground,
with sparks of fire and blaze.

Shlok 24: The five excellent monkeys, viz. Rishabha, Sharabha, Neela, Gavaksha and
Gandhamadana marched ahead quickly towards Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 25: Those five mighty monkeys struck the large-bodied Kumbhakarna from all sides, with
crags, trees, palms of their hands, feet and fists in battle.

Shlok 26: Perceiving those blows merely as the senses of touch, Kumbhakarna was not at all
perturbed. He enfolded the greatly agitated Rishabha in his arms.

Shlok 27: Squeezed by Kumbhakarna's arms, the awful Rishabha, the foremost among the monkeys,
fell down with blood coming out of his mouth.

Shlok 28- 29: Then, in battle, the enraged Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, beating Sharabha with
his fist and Neela with his knee, struck Gavaksha with a palm of his hand and struck Gandhamadana
violently with his feet.

Shlok 30: Perturbed by the blows given by Kumbhakarna, those monkeys being moistened with
blood, were bewildered and fell down on the ground, like chopped off Kimsuka trees.

Shlok 31: Seeing those mighty chief commanders of monkeys falling down on the ground,
thousands of monkeys ran towards Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 32: All those champions of monkeys, looking like mountains, jumping up on Kumbhakarna
who was looking like a mountain, ascended him and bit him with their teeth.

Shlok 33: Those mighty armed excellent monkeys encountered that Kumbhakarna with their nails,
teeth, fists and arms.

Shlok 34: Covered by thousands of monkeys that foremost among demons looking like a mountain,
stood out in a crowd, as a hill overgrown with trees.

Shlok 35: Seizing all the monkeys with his arms, that mighty Kumbhakarna devoured them like an
enraged Garuda the eagle devouring the serpents.

Shlok 36: Hurled by Kumbhakarna in his mouth which was looking like a hole in the earth, the
monkeys again came out from his nostrils and ears.

Shlok 37: Kumbhakarna, the best among the demons, looking like a mountain, was very much
enraged and mutilated the monkeys angrily, before devouring them.

Shlok 38: Making the earth dampened with flesh and blood, that demon, like an excited fire at
the time of dissolution, strolled among that army of monkeys.

Shlok 39: Wielding a spike in his hand in the battle-front, the mighty Kumbhakarna shone like
Indra the lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt in his hand and like Yama the god of death
wielding a noose in his hand.

Shlok 40: That Kumbhakarna scorched away that army of monkeys in the same way as the fire
scorches away the dried-up forests in summer.

Shlok 41: Those monkeys, without a commander, having their troops killed and terrified with
fear they were being destroyed by Kumbhakarna, roared with rebellious voices.

Shlok 42: While Kumbhakarna was destroying them in many ways, the agitated monkeys sought
refuge in Rama, with their distressed minds.

Shlok 43: Seeing the monkeys defeated in that great battle, Angada the son of Indra, ran
rapidly towards Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 44: Taking a large mountain-top, Angada, roaring repeatedly and frightening all the
demons following Kumbhakarna's heels, hurled the mountain-top on Kumbhakarna's head.

Shlok 45- 46: Struck on the head with that mountain, that Kumbhakarna, Indra's adversary, with a
great rage, was excited and then ran rapidly towards the wrathful Angada.

Shlok 47: Frightening all the monkeys with his great roar, the mighty Kumbhakarna hurled his
spike at Angada with anger.

Shlok 48: Knowing that the spike is going to fall on him, the mighty Angada, the chief of the
monkeys, who was skilled in war-fare, avoided it with his alacrity.

Shlok 49: Jumping up Angada struck on Kumbhakarna's chest, with the palm of his hand. Thus
beaten with anger by him, Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain, became giddy.

Shlok 50: Getting his consciousness, that mighty demon threw down Angada by tightening his
fist with a scorn. Angada fell down unconscious.

Shlok 51: When that Angada the foremost among the monkeys fell down unconscious on the ground,
Kumbhakarna ran towards Sugreeva, taking that spike in his hand.

Shlok 52: Then, seeing the mighty Kumbhakarna coming suddenly towards him, the valiant
Sugreeva, the king of the monkeys, sprang up all at once.

Shlok 53: Uplifting and tightly holding a mountain-top, the mighty Sugreeva ran towards the
sturdy Kumbhakarna with speed.

Shlok 54: Seeing that Sugreeva coming rapidly towards him, Kumbhakarna, with all his limbs
braced, stood facing the king of monkeys.

Shlok 55: Seeing Kumbhakarna who stood devouring the monkeys and with his body smeared with
the blood of the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke as follows:

Shlok 56: "You struck down eminent monkeys. You have done a very difficult act. You have
devoured the armies. You obtained a great fame."

Shlok 57: "Leave that army of monkeys. What will you do with these common beings? O demon! You
bear up against the falling of this one mountain being hurled by me."

Shlok 58: Hearing those words, endowed with strength and courage, spoken by Sugreeva,
Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, spoke the following words:

Shlok 59: "O monkey! You are the grandson of Lord Brahma and even the son of Riksharaja
(sprung from the yawn of Brahma) endowed with firmness and valour. Why do you roar?"

Shlok 60: Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Sugreeva, firmly holding the mountain, hurled it
quickly on him. He struck Kumbhakarna's chest by that mountain, which was as strong enough as
Indra's thunderbolt.

Shlok 61: Soon after falling on his broad chest, that mountain was crushed to pieces. Then,
the monkeys were suddenly distressed. The troops of demons roared with rejoice.

Shlok 62: Struck by the mountain-top, that Kumbhakarna was enraged and roared with his mouth
wide open with anger. Holding firmly the spike, which was emitting a flash of lightning, he hurled
it to kill Sugreeva, the king of monkeys and bears.

Shlok 63: Hanuma, jumping up and holding with his arms that sharp spike, furnished with golden
wreaths, and propelled by Kumbhakarna's arms, wreaths, and smashed it rapidly.

Shlok 64: Then, the rejoiced Hanuma, placing on his knee, that large spike made of iron
weighing twenty thousand Tulas, broke it.

Shlok 65: Seeing Hanuma breaking the spike, that army of monkeys was rejoiced, roared several
times and came back quickly from all quarters.

Shlok 66: Then, the frightened Kumbhakarna became down-cast. Those monkeys were rejoiced and
made a lion's roar. Seeing the fate of spike in such a broken condition, they adored Hanuma.

Shlok 67: Seeing that spike broken in that way, that mighty Kumbhakarna was enraged. Uprooting
a crest from Malaya mountain standing in the vicinity of Lanka and approaching Sugreeva, he struck
him with it.

Shlok 68: Struck by the mountain-top in battle, that Sugreeva fell unconscious on the ground.
Seeing him falling unconscious on the ground in battle, the demons wee exceedingly pleased and
cried out loudly.

Shlok 69: Seizing hold of that Sugreeva having wonderful and terrific prowess in battle, that
Kumbhakarna took him away, as an impetuous wind takes away a cloud.

Shlok 70: Lifting up Sugreeva appearing like a huge cloud in the battle-field and marching
forward, Kumbhakarna shone like Mount Meru, distinguished by its very high and formidable peak.

Shlok 71: Then, being praised in the battle-field by the demons for having seized hold of
Sugreeva and hearing the sounds of the celestials who were wondering at the seizure of Sugreeva,
Kumbhakarna the valiant chief of demons, sallied forth.

Shlok 72: While taking away that Sugreeva looking like Indra, Kumbhakarna the adversary of
Indra and having the prowess of Indra, thought, "If he is killed, all this army including Rama gets
destroyed."

Shlok 73: Seeing the army of monkeys running away hither and thither and Sgureeva the monkey
even being taken away by Kumbhakarna, the intellectual Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought as
follows:

Shlok 74- 75: "While Sugreeva is being taken away in this way, what is to be done by me? I shall
certainly do that which is justifiable to be done by me. Growing to the size of a mountain, I shall
destroy this Kumbhakarna."

Shlok 76: "Let all the monkeys be delighted while Sugreeva the king of monkeys is liberated
and the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his body crumbled by the blows of my fists, killed by me in
battle."

Shlok 77: "Even otherwise, this Sugreeva can win the freedom himself despite he is taken away
by celestials including demons and serpent-demons."

Shlok 78: "I think Sugreeva is not yet conscious of his self, as Kumbhakarna struck him with
the blow of a mountain in the battle."

Shlok 79: "Regaining his consciousness within a moment in this great battle, this Sugreeva
will do what is good for himself and for his monkeys."

Shlok 80: "If I liberate this great-souled Sugreeva, there will be a painful dislike for him
and a perpetual in fame."

Shlok 81: 'Therefore, I shall wait for a while, for the king to show his prowess. Meanwhile, I
shall cheer up the scattered army of monkeys."

Shlok 82: Thinking in this way, Hanuma the son of wind-god, then again brought firmness to the
large army of monkeys.

Shlok 83: Taking that Sugreeva who was throbbing, that kumbhakarna entered the City of Lanka,
where he was greatly revered with showers of foremost flowers by the citizens staying in celestial
cars, streets, houses and gate-ways of temples.

Shlok 84: Sprinkled by those showers of pop-corn and fragrant waters and due to the coolness
of the royal roads, the mighty Sugreeva gradually regained his consciousness.

Shlok 85: The great souled Sugreeva, who was interposed between Kumbhakarna's shoulders,
regaining his consciousness with great difficulty and observing the royal highway of the city,
repeatedly thought (as follows):

Shlok 86: "Having been captivated in this way, what should I do now? I have to do a proper act
now which is desirable and beneficial to the monkeys."

Shlok 87: Thus thinking, Sugreeva tore asunder Kumbhakarna's ears by his nails as also nose by
his teeth and ribs by his feet.

Shlok 88: Torn asunder with teeth and nails by Sugreeva, that Kumbhakarna with his ears and
nose deprived and his limbs moistened with blood, was subdued with rage, threw Sugreeva down on the
floor and crushed him.

Shlok 89: Crushed down on the floor by that terrific Kumbhakarna and struck by the demons,
Sugreeva moved with speed like a ball towards the sky and got united with Rama.

Shlok 90: Bereft of his ears and nose, the mighty Kumbhakarna, pouring out blood, shone like a
mountain with its streaming cascades.

Shlok 91- 92: Kumbhakarna the demon and the brother of Ravana, having his large body bathed in
blood, frightful in appearance, vomiting blood with rage, and looking like a mound of black
antimony shone akin to a cloud with an evening-twilight. With his face directed towards the
battle-front, Kumbhakarna the terrific demon made up his mind to continue his combat.

Shlok 93: After the departure of Sugreeva, Kumbhakarna the adversary of Indra, with a rage,
marched ahead quickly for the battle. Finding out that he is then without any weapon, the dreadful
Kumbhakarna got possession of a hammer-like weapon.

Shlok 94: Starting from the city quickly, that mighty Kumbhakarna then devoured that huge army
of monkeys in battle, like the devour of people by the augmented fire at the time of dissolution of
the world.

Shlok 95: Penetrating that huge army of monkeys, Kumbhakarna who was greedily desirous of
flesh and blood in hunger, due to his deep bewilderment in battle, ate away even the demons,
monkeys, devils and bears. He devoured the principal monkeys just as the death devours people at
the time of the end of the world.

Shlok 96: The enraged Kumbhakarna, quickly taking with his single hand, the monkeys and
demons, in one's two's, three's or in many and hurled them into his mouth

Shlok 97: Struck with mountain-peaks, by the monkeys, the mighty Kumbhakarna, then, gushing
forth his flesh and blood, devoured the monkeys.

Shlok 98: Thereupon, those monkeys, who were being devoured, sought Rama as their refuge. The
very much enraged Kumbhakarna, while eating away the monkeys, marched forward.

Shlok 99: Grasping a hundred, a seven, an eight, a twenty and a thirty with his arms,
Kumbhakarna was devouring the monkeys and running about in the battle-field.

Shlok 100: Having his entire body besmeared with flesh, marrow and blood together with wreaths
of tangled viscera hung over his ears, the demon with his very sharp teeth, rained spikes on the
monkeys, like Yama, the god of death, risen to power at the end of the world-cycle.

Shlok 101: Immediately, Lakshmana the son of Sumitra, the annihilator of the foe's army and
conqueror of the cities of adversaries, commenced the battle with a rage.

Shlok 102: The valiant Lakshmana pierced seven arrows into the body of Kumbhakarna. He took
some more arrows and released them too.

Shlok 103: Tormented by that weapon of Lakshmana, that demon destroyed it completely.
Thereupon, the aggressive Lakshmana was enraged.

Shlok 104: Then, Lakshmana covered the shining and charming golden armour of Kumbhakarna with
his arrows, even as the wind would make an evening-twilight cloud completely disappear.

Shlok 105: Kumbhakarna, looking like a mound of collyrium, tormented by the arrows, decked with
gold, shone like the radiant sun with its rays screened by clouds.

Shlok 106: Then, that terrific demon, with a thunderous noise of multiple clouds, spoke the
following words disrespectfully to Lakshmana.

Shlok 107: "You declared your heroism fearlessly in battle, by attacking me, who has conquered
even the lord of death effortlessly in a combat."

Shlok 108: "Anyone who even stands before me, the god of death, holding forth a weapon in a
great battle here, is venerable. What to tell about a person who bestows battle on me?"

Shlok 109: "Even the powerful Indra, the lord of celestials, who mounted Airavata the elephant
and accompanied by all celestials, did not ever stand before me in battle."

Shlok 110: "O Lakshmana! Today, I am gratified by your strength and abilities. Taking leave of
you, I desire to march forward towards Rama."

Shlok 111: "Because I have been gratified by you by way of your ability, strength and firmness
in battle, I for my part desire to kill Rama alone, for when he is killed, all the army will be
killed."

Shlok 112: "When Rama is killed by me battle here, I will make my army to fight with others who
remain on the battle filled and destroy them."

Shlok 113: To that demon in battle, who has given his opinion thus, abounding in enology,
Lakshmana as though bursting with laughter, spoke the following extremely terrific words:

Shlok 114: "O brave demon! You are telling that while you show your prowess, the heroes like
Indra and others feel unbearable; it is true. Just now, I have seen your prowess. But, see Rama the
son of Dasaratha, standing here unmoving like a mountain."

Shlok 115- 116: Hearing in this manner, that mighty Kumbhakarna the demon, brushing aside Lakshmana
and crossing him, ran, as though he is causing an earth-quake, towards Rama.

Shlok 117: Thereupon, Rama, the son of Dasaratha, employing a spell (used to charm arrows)
called Raudra, discharged sharp arrows into Kumbhakarna's chest.

Shlok 118: Flames of fire mixed with particles of charcoal came forth from the face of
Kumbhakarna, who was thus struck and who was running quickly towards Rama.

Shlok 119: That foremost among demons, struck by Rama's arrow, roaring terribly with rage,
making the monkeys to run away in battle, ran himself towards Rama.

Shlok 120: Those arrows, adorned with peacock's plumes, penetrated into his chest. His mace
dropped off from his hand and fell on the ground.

Shlok 121: All his weapons fell scattered on the ground. Considering himself as weaponless,
that mighty Kumbhakarna then fought fiercely with his fists and arms.

Shlok 122: That Kumbhakarna, with his body struck fiercely by arrows and bathed in blood,
poured forth blood, even as a mountain would pour forth a cascade.

Shlok 123: With a terrific wrath, he felt insensible with blood. He roamed about, devouring the
monkeys, demons and bears.

Shlok 124: Then, that Kumbhakarna, comparable to Yama the god of death, of terrific prowess and
strength, firmly holding a fearful mountain-peak, hurled it towards Rama.

Shlok 125: Wile that mountain peak was still on its way and had not yet reached him Rama,
fixing together his well-known bow and arrows, split the mountain in the middle, with seven
straight-going arrows.

Shlok 126: Then, Rama, the virtuous man and the elder brother of Bharata, split the large
mountain-peak which was hurled by Kumbhakarna at that time, with his variegated arrows made of
gold.

Shlok 127: That mountain-peak, in the form of a peak of Mount Meru, as if shining with
splendour, while falling, caused two hundred monkeys to fall.

Shlok 128: At that time, considering various strategies appropriate for killing Kumbhakarna,
the righteous Lakshmana spoke to Rama as follows:

Shlok 129: "O king! He is not able to recognize who the monkeys are and who the demons are.
Intoxicated with the smell of blood, he is devouring his own persons and also others."

Shlok 130: "Let the foremost of monkeys ascend well upon his body from all sides. Following the
commanders of their troops, let the monkey-leaders stand, surrounding him."

Shlok 131: "If we do in that way, that evil-minded demon would be harassed by the huge weight,
making him to crawl on the floor and cannot kill the other monkeys."

Shlok 132: Hearing those words of that intelligent Lakshmana, those monkeys were rejoiced and
mounted on the body of Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 133: Kumbhakarna, when climbed upon by the monkeys, was enraged and shook them off with
violence, as a vicious elephant would shake off its mahout.

Shlok 134: Seeing the monkeys shaken down, Rama on his part understanding that he was enraged,
jumped up speedily towards the demon and took an excellent bow.

Shlok 135- 136: The heroic Rama, enraged with red-hot eyes, as though he was scorching the enemy
with his looks, walked with speed, causing delight to all the leaders of the monkey-troops, who
were tormented with the fear of Kumbhakarna and quickly marched towards the demon.

Shlok 137: Taking in his hand, a terrific bow with a firmly fastened cord looking like a snake
and looking variegated with its crust of gold, with a quiver full of excellent arrows fastened on
his back and fully restoring the monkeys to confidence, that Rama quickly marched forward.

Shlok 138: That mighty and heroic Rama, who was highly unconquerable, accompanied by Lakshmana,
duly marched forward, surrounded by those troops of monkeys.

Shlok 139: The mighty Rama saw the powerful Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, wearing a
crown and his eyes blood-red with anger.

Shlok 140: Rama saw the angry Kumbhakarna, chasing all, like the mythical elephant guarding one
of the quarters, searching for the monkeys, enraged as he was and surrounded by the demons.

Shlok 141: Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, looking like Vindhya and Mandara mountains, adorned with
armlets of gold, emitting blood from his mouth and appearing as a rising rainy cloud.

Shlok 142: Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, who was licking the corners of his mouth which were
bathed in blood, all they way trampling the monkeys and resembling Yama in the form of
all-destroying time.

Shlok 143: Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, having a splendour of blazing fire,
Rama, the excellent of men, then stretched his bow.

Shlok 144: Enraged by the twang of Rama's bow, Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, not
tolerating that sound, ran towards Rama.

Shlok 145: Thereupon, Rama spoke to the dashing Kumbhakarna looking like a cloud driven by the
wind, whose arms were like the coils of Vasuki (the king of serpents) and appearing like a mountain
in the battle-field (as follows):

Shlok 146: "O leader of the demons! Come on. Do not regret. I sand, wielding a bow in my hand.
Know me to be the annihilator of the race of demons. You will be dead within a moment."

Shlok 147: Coming to know that he was Rama, Kumbhakarna laughed in a rebellious tone and ran up
enraged towards the monkeys, driving them away in the battle-field.

Shlok 148: That Kumbhakarna of great splendour, as though bursting the hearts of all the
monkeys, laughed unnaturally as also awfully and spoke the following words to Rama:

Shlok 149: 'I am neither to be considered as Viradha nor Kabandha nor Khara nor Vali nor
Maricha. It is Kumbhakarna who arrived here."

Shlok 150: "See my large terrific hammer, completely made of iron. By it, the celestials and
the demons were conquered by me before."

Shlok 151: "You need not treat me with contempt, as I am deprived of my ear and nose. To me,
there is no agony even indeed a little, for having lost the ear and the nose."

Shlok 152: "O faultless excellent Rama born in Ikshavaku dynasty! Show your prowess on my
limbs. After seeing your strength and prowess, I will be devouring you."

Shlok 153: Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, that Rama released plumed arrows. Even after
struck by them, whose speed was equal to a thunderbolt, that demon was neither shaken nor
afflicted.

Shlok 154: Those arrows, which chopped off the Sala trees and killed Vali the foremost of
monkeys, could not torment Kumbhakarna's body which was like a thunderbolt.

Shlok 155: Sucking those arrows with his body, as mountains suck up torments of water, that
Kumbhakarna, flourishing his hammer with terrible speed, hindered the tremendous speed of Rama's
arrows.

Shlok 156: Then, flourishing that hammer which was smeared with blood and which can frighten
the great army of celestials, in terrific speed, that demon scared away the army of monkeys.

Shlok 157: Thereupon, taking a great missile called Vayavya, Rama hurled it on the demon. By
that weapon, he chopped off Kumbhakarna's arm along with the hammer. With his arm chopped off,
Kumbhakarna roared tumultuously.

Shlok 158: That Kumbhakarna's arm, identical to a mountain-peak, which was chopped off by
Rama's arrow, fell along with the hammer on that army of Sugreeva and killed that regiment of
monkeys.

Shlok 159: Those monkeys who had escaped being broken and slain by that arm, though dejected
with their tormented limbs and taking recourse to the sides, witnessed a highly terrific encounter
between Rama and Kumbhakarna.

Shlok 160: Having an arm chopped off by the arrow like a mountain-peak chopped off by a
gigantic sword, that Kumbhakarna with his another arm, pulled up a tree by its roots and then ran
towards Rama the lord of men in that battle-front.

Shlok 161: By his arrow, which was made variegated by gold and furnished with a mystic spell of
Indra used for charming it, Rama chopped off Kumbhakarna's remaining arm, appearing like the coil
of a serpent along with his uprooted palm-tree.

Shlok 162: That Kumbhakarna's arm, which appeared like a hill, was chopped off and fell down on
the ground. Wallowing hither and thither, it dashed with trees, rocks, monkeys and demons.

Shlok 163: Seeing Kumbhakarna with his arms chopped off, abruptly with a roar, coming upon him
and taking two sharp arrows with a shape of a half-moon each, Rama chopped off the feet of the
demon in that battle.

Shlok 164: Creating a resound everywhere in all directions, even in hill-caves, in the great
ocean, in Lanka as also in the armies of monkeys and demons, Kumbhakarna's feet fell down.

Shlok 165: Widely opening his mouth like the mouth of a submarine fire and roaring, Kumbhakarna
whose arms and feet were cut off, ran (with thighs) quickly towards Rama, like Rahu the
seizer-demon going to seize the moon in the sky.

Shlok 166: Rama filled up Kumbhakarna's mouth with sharply pointed arrows, having shafts
covered with gold. With his mouth full of arrows, Kumbhakarna was unable to speak. He moaned with
difficulty and even became unconscious.

Shlok 167: Thereupon, that Rama got hold of an arrow spelled with a missile presided over by
Indra the lord of celestials, effulgent as sun's rays, resembling the rod of Brahma the lord of
creation as also the destructive Kala, the Time-Spirit, and having its speed equal to the wind.

Shlok 168: Rama discharged against the demon, that arrow, whose shaft was inlaid with diamonds
and gold, which was shining as the dazzling sun and fire set ablaze, and which vied with the speed
of Indra's thunderbolt.

Shlok 169: That arrow, propelled by Rama's arm, with a terrific aspect like the smokeless fire,
having a formidable energy of Indra's thunderbolt and illuminating the ten quarters with its own
splendour, proceeded forward.

Shlok 170: That Rama slashed Kumbhakarna's head, which was looking like a huge mountain-peak,
having well-rounded tusks and with charming and quivering ear-rings, as like Indra the destroyer of
strong-holds, in the past, chopped off the head of Vritra, the demon of darkness and drought.

Shlok 171: The large Kumbhakarna's head, adorned with ear-rings, shone like the moon being in
the middle, when the constellation, Punarvasu (presided over by Aditi the mother of gods and
consisting of twin-stars) has risen at the night.

Shlok 172: That demon's head, equal in size to a mountain, struck by Rama's arrow, fell down.
It broke the buildings on the king's high-way and their gates as also threw down that high
rampart.

Shlok 173: Then, that colossal demon of a great splendour fell into the sea. It crushed the
principal alligators, beautiful fishes as also snakes and entered the bowels of the earth.

Shlok 174: While that mighty Kumbhakarna, the enemy of brahmanas and celestials was killed in
battle, the earth and mountains shook. Even the celestials raised a tumultuous roar with joy.

Shlok 175: Then, saints of the celestial class, great sages*, serpents, gods, genii, Suparnas
(a class of bird-like beings of a semi-divine character), Guhyakas (another class of demi-gods),
including troops of Yakshas and Gandharvas (celestial musicians) standing in the sky, were rejoiced
at Rama's prowess.

[Commentary] * Ten Maharshis were created by Manu svayambhuva viz. Marichi, Atri, Angiras,
Pracetas, Vasishta, Bhrign, Narada. Some add Daksha, Dharma, Gantama, Kanva, Valmiki, Vyasa, Manu,
Vibhandaka.

Shlok 176: Thereupon, at the mere sight of Rama, Ravana's relatives were perturbed at the
killing of Ravana of great intelligence and loudly roared, as elephants roar at the sight of a
lion.

Shlok 177: Having destroyed Kumbhakarna in battle, that Rama shone in the midst of the army of
monkeys, in the same way as the sun shines in the midst of the celestial world, having destroyed
darkness, duly getting delivered from the mouth of Rahu.

Shlok 178: Several monkeys were highly rejoiced, with their faces flowing like full-blown
lotuses. They adored Rama, who was dangerous to be attacked and as a beloved young man, killed an
enemy possessing a terrible strength.

Shlok 179: By killing Kumbhakarna, who tormented the army of celestials and who was not
defeated at any time in great battles, Rama was rejoiced in the same way as Indra the lord of
celestials was rejoiced in killing Vritra, the great demon.



SARGA 68
------------------------------

[Text] Hearing the news of Kumbhakarna having been killed by Rama, Ravana laments in
various ways, thinking that he has virtually lost his right arm. Ravana initially faints on hearing
the shocking news. On regaining consciousness, Ravana again wonders how the invincible Kumbhakarna
was slain in battle. He feels sorry for not having listened to the sagacious advice of Vibhishana
in the past.

Shlok 1: Seeing that the great-souled Rama killed Kumbhakarna, the demons reported the matter
to Ravana, the king of demons (as follows):

Shlok 2: "O king! That Kumbhakarna, looking like Yama the god of death, driving away the army
of monkeys and devouring some monkeys, met with death, the time's act."

Shlok 3- 4- 5: "Showing his prowess for a moment, Kumbhakarna your brother, was extinguished by the
fiery energy of Rama. Injured by Rama's arrows, Kumbhakarna who was looking like a mountain became
an ugly mass, with his body discharging blood, as his nose and ears were cut off, resembling a tree
scorched by a forest-fire, with his trunk half-submerged in a terribly looking sea and obstructing
the main gate of Lanka."

Shlok 6: Hearing that the mighty Kumbhakarna was killed in battle, Ravana was tormented with
grief and fell down, fainted.

Shlok 7: Hearing that his paternal uncle was killed; Devantaka, Narantaka, Trishira and
Atikaya were afflicted with sorrow and wept.

Shlok 8: Hearing that Kumbhakarna, their brother was killed by Rama, who was unwary in his
actions, Mahodara and Mahaparshva (step-brothers of Kumbhakarna) were overcome with grief.

Shlok 9: Then, recovering his consciousness with difficulty, distressed as he was for the
killing of Kumbhakarna and perplexed in mind, Ravana the foremost of demons, lamented (as
follows):

Shlok 10: "Alas! O hero, destroying the pride of enemies! O mighty Kumbhakarna! Leaving me
behind, you have gone by divine will to the abode of Yama the lord of death."

Shlok 11: "O mighty Kumbhakarna! Where are you going alone, leaving me behind, after having
tormented the army of enemies and without taking away the thorn of grief from relatives and
me."

Shlok 12: "Indeed I shall no longer live now, that this right hand of mine, taking refuge on
when I had no fear of celestials and ogres, has fallen down."

Shlok 13: "How such a hero, who destroyed the pride of celestials and demons, as also who was
an image of fire that was to destroy the world, was killed by Rama today in battle?"

Shlok 14: "Having been afflicted by Rama's arrows, how are you, whom not even a clash of a
thunder-bolt ever caused any fall, falling now insensibly on the earth's surface?"

Shlok 15: "Seeing you killed in battle, these troops of celestials and sages, standing in the
sky, are shouting with rejoice."

Shlok 16: "It is doubly sure that the monkeys, having achieved their purpose, will be rejoiced
and now itself will ascend the inaccessible door-ways of Lanka here from all sides."

Shlok 17: "I have nothing to do with a kingdom and what shall I do with Seetha? I have no
intention to live, bereft of Kumbhakarna."

Shlok 18: "If I cannot kill Rama, who killed my brother, in battle, I would indeed prefer
death, but in no case this useless life which has no meaning."

Shlok 19: "Now itself, I will go to that place, where my younger brother is there. I do not
wish to live even for a moment, after abandoning my brothers."

Shlok 20: "Seeing me, who did harm to them in the past, the celestials will indeed mock me. O
Kumbhakarna! Now that you are dead, how can I conquer Indra the lord of celestials?"

Shlok 21: "Those words of that great-souled Vibhishana, which I did not accept due to
ignorance, have come true."

Shlok 22: "Ever since this cruel end of Kumbhakarna and Prahasta has happened, I am feeling
shameful."

Shlok 23: "Since that venerable Vibhishana, my pious brother was banished by me, this bitter
fruit of that painful deed has come to me."

Shlok 24: Having thus lamented very much piteously in various ways on coming to know that
Kumbhakarna, his younger brother and the enemy of Indra having been killed, Ravana the ten-headed
demon, whose inner feelings were agitated, even sank down, extremely disturbed.



SARGA 69
------------------------------

[Text] As Ravana is lamenting over the death of Kumbhakarna, Trishira (one of Ravana's
sons) consoles him and says that he will go to the battle-field and kill Rama. Hearing the words of
Trishira, Ravana's other sons (Devantaka, Narantaka and Atikaya) also come forward to join the
fight. Then Ravana sends all them to the battle. He also sends Mahodara and Mahaparshva, his
brothers to guard his sons. Mighty demons accompany them. The demons release arrows towards the
monkeys, who see the demons coming in elephants, horses and chariots. The monkeys take huge rocks
and trees to fight with the demons. Seeing several demons being killed in battle, Narantaka enters
the field with his javelin and kills several monkeys. Meanwhile, those monkeys who were thrown down
unconscious by Kumbhakarna earlier regain their consciousness and approach Sugreeva for help. Then,
Sugreeva sends Angada for the fight. Narantaka hurls his javelin towards Angada's chest, but the
javelin breaks and falls down. Angada strikes Narantaka's horse with his hand and the horse falls
down dead. Then, Angada and Narantaka exchange the blows of their fists on each other in battle and
finally, Narantaka dies.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of the evil-minded Ravana, who was thus lamenting, as he was
overcome with grief, Trishira (one of his sons) spoke as follows:

Shlok 2: "Truly in such a manner, the highly valiant Kumbhakarna, (the middle of our father
and uncles) has been killed. But good persons like you do not lament as you are doing, O king!"

Shlok 3: "O Lord! You are capable of conquering even the three worlds. Why are you, as such,
lamenting about yourself, as a common person?"

Shlok 4: "You do continue to have a javelin given by Brahma, an armour, a bow and an arrow
together with a chariot yoked to a thousand donkeys, emitting a sound resembling the rumbling of a
cloud."

Shlok 5: "The celestials and giants were indeed destroyed several times by you with your
various types of weapons. As such, you can punish Rama, when endowed with all weapons."

Shlok 6: "You stay on, O monarch! I will set out and eradicate your enemies in battle, as
Garuda the eagle eradicates the serpents."

Shlok 7: "Beaten down by me, as Shambara by Indra and Naraka* by Vishnu, I will lay down Rama
today in battle."

[Commentary] * This Naraka was not naraka, the son of Mother Earth, who died at the hands of
Lord Krishna. He was procreated through Simhika and Viprachitti. His six brothers were Vatapi,
Namuchi, Ilwala, Shrimara, Andhaka and Kalanabha.

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of Trishira, Ravana the king of demons considered himself as
though born anew, after being summoned by Death.

Shlok 9: Hearing the words of Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka and the energetic Atikaya were
rejoiced of war.

Shlok 10: Then, the brave Ravana's sons, whose prowess was equal to Indra and the foremost of
demons, roared asserting their superiority saying "I will lead, I will lead!"

Shlok 11: All of them wee capable of passing through the sky. All were skilled in magic. All
had humbled the pride of gods. All were fierce in battle.

Shlok 12: All were endowed with great strength. All were widely renowned. All were such as had
never been heard of having been conquered by celestials or Gandharvas or Kinnaras or large serpents
while encountering a battle.

Shlok 13: All the demons were valiant ones, well-versed in weaponry. All were skilled in
war-fare. All were greatly knowledgeable and all had obtained boons.

Shlok 14: That Ravana the king, surrounded by his sons, who were radiant as the sun and who
tormented the strength and fortune of the enemies, shone like Indra surrounded by celestials who
can destroy the pride of gigantic demons.

Shlok 15: Embracing his sons, embellishing them with ornaments and blessing them profusely,
Ravana sent them to battle.

Shlok 16: For the defense of his sons, Ravana sent Yuddhonmatta and Matta (better known as
Mahodara and Mahaparshva), his brothers to the battle.

Shlok 17: Those demons with colossal bodies, paid obeisance (by circumambulating) to Ravana
(who caused the people to cry in terror) and departed.

Shlok 18: Anointing their bodies with all types of herbs and perfumes, those six mighty and
excellent demons went away, eager to fight.

Shlok 19: Trishira, Atikaya, Devantaka, Narantaka, Mahodara and Mahaparshva, under the clout
of destiny; set out for the battle.

Shlok 20: Thereupon, Mahodara mounted an elephant called Sudarshana, like unto a dark-cloud
and born in Airavata-race.

Shlok 21: That Mahodara, adorned with quivers, endowed with all types of armoury and mounting
the elephant, shone like the sun on the peak of Ashtachala mountain.

Shlok 22: Trishira, the son of Ravana, ascended an exquisite chariot, yoked to excellent
horses and filled with all types of armoury.

Shlok 23: Trishira, wielding a bow and mounting the chariot, shone like a cloud with
glittering meteors, illuminations and a rain-bow.

Shlok 24: That Trishira with three diadems in that exquisite chariot, stood out like Mount
Himavat, the king of mountains with its three golden hills.

Shlok 25: Then, Atikaya, having very fiery energy, the son of Ravana and the foremost among
the wielders of bow, mounted an excellent chariot.

Shlok 26: Atikaya mounted that chariot, having first-rate wheels and axles, well-yoked, having
a good carriage and pole, filled with quivers and bows and flashingly full of missiles, swords and
maces.

Shlok 27: He was radiant with his diadem, shining in brilliant gold and other ornaments, like
Mount Meru, causing to shine with its splendours (by the sun).

Shlok 28: In that chariot, Atikaya that mighty prince, surrounded by the foremost of demons,
shone like Indra surrounded by celestials.

Shlok 29: Narantaka mounted a white gigantic horse, similar to Uchchaishrava (the mount of
Indra), adorned with gold ornaments and as swift as thought.

Shlok 30: Narantaka, holding a javelin, which was resplendent like a meteor, appeared shining,
like Guha (the offspring of Shiva) holding a spear and riding a beautiful peacock.

Shlok 31: Devantaka, holding a glided iron-bar, marched ahead, resembling an incarnation of
Vishnu holding Mandara-mountain in his arms.

Shlok 32: Mahaparshva, possessing a great splendour and vigour and wielding a mace in his arm
in battle, looked like Kubera the lord of wealth.

Shlok 33: Those distinguished demons set out from. Lanka, like the gods leaving Amaravati.
Mighty demons, holding excellent weaponry, accompanied them, mounting on elephants, horses and
chariots making sounds of rumbling clouds.

Shlok 34: Those mighty princes, having sun's brilliance, wearing diadems and possessed of
prosperity, shone like glowing planets in the sky.

Shlok 35: The row of auspicious attire worn by them, shone like an autumnal cloud or like a
flock of cranes in the sky.

Shlok 36: Determined either to die or to vanquish their enemies, those valiant demons went
forward, thus making their courageous resolve, eager to fight.

Shlok 37: Those mighty demons set out with a mad conception of war, roared and made a
reverberatory sound, took up arrows and dispatched them.

Shlok 38: The earth trembled as it were, by their battle-cries and clapping of arms. The sky
appeared breached, by the lion's roars of the demons.

Shlok 39: Those mighty leaders of demons, having set out, were delighted to see the army of
monkeys having uplifted rocks as their weapons.

Shlok 40- 41: The mighty monkeys too saw that army of demons, which appeared like a black cloud
but blazing like fire and sun on all sides, abounding with elephants, horses and chariots, made to
resound with hundreds of small bells and wielding well-raised great weaponry.

Shlok 42: Seeing that army which arrived and as they got the target for their fight, the
monkeys, having the great mountains uplifted, roared again and again. The monkeys, not tolerating
the demons, thus shouted, standing opposite to them.

Shlok 44: Hearing the enhanced noise of the leaders of the army of monkeys, the troops of
demons who were terrible in might, not tolerating the rejoice of the enemies, then made a noise
more terribly.

Shlok 45: Entering that terrific army of demons, those monkey-leaders, with their raised
mountains, roamed about like mountains with their peaks.

Shlok 46: Some monkeys entering the sky and some others enraged, staying on earth with trees
and rocks as their weapons, wandered among the army of demons.

Shlok 47: The foremost among the monkeys, holding trees, having extensive branches, roamed
about in the battle-field. That battle-front, filled with demons and monkeys, looked terrific.

Shlok 48: Those monkeys, of terrific prowess, though impeded by a flood of arrows, initiated a
matchless rain of trees, rocks and mountains.

Shlok 49: In the battle, the demons and the monkeys made a noise of lion's roars. The monkeys
pounded the demons with rocks.

Shlok 50: The enraged monkeys killed demons wearing armours and ornaments. Some killed valiant
demons, sitting or standing in chariots and also those demons mounted on elephants and horses.

Shlok 51: Valiant monkeys struck the demons vehemently. Those foremost of demons trembled, as
their bodies were attacked by mountain-peaks and blows of fists, down and roared.

Shlok 52: Those demons also pierced the foremost of monkeys with sharp arrows, striking them
with spears mallets, swords, javelins and lances.

Shlok 53: There, the monkeys and demons having their limbs smeared with the blood of their
foes, mowed each other with a desire to conquer each other.

Shlok 54: Thereupon, within an instant, the battle-field became dampened with blood and
covered by the mountains and swords thrown by the monkeys and demons.

Shlok 55: Then the battle-field became filled with dead bodies of demons, who had an ardent
passion for battle, having their colossal bodies devastated and scattered all over.

Shlok 56: The demons, already thrown down and still being thrown down, with their spears
broken by the monkeys at that time, approached the monkeys and carried out a wonderful combat with
their limbs, arms and legs.

Shlok 57: Those foremost of demons struck the monkeys with their own corpses and the monkeys
also struck the titans with their own dead bodies.

Shlok 58: Then, grabbing the rocks and mountains, those titans struck the monkeys with them.
The apes too, snatching away their weapons, struck the titans.

Shlok 59: The monkeys and demons fractured each other with crags and made a noise with lion's
roars.

Shlok 60: The titans, having their armours broken, as struck by the apes, emitted blood at
that place, like trees oozing their sap.

Shlok 61: Some monkeys in the battle-front destroyed chariot with chariots, elephants with the
very elephants and horse by the very horses.

Shlok 62: The titans broke the trees and rocks of monkey-chiefs with their sharp arrows with
their hoe-shaped head, those arrows with crescent-shaped head and those with spear-like head.

Shlok 63: The battle-field, filled with those mountains, broken trees and dead bodies of apes
and titans, became difficult to be traversed.

Shlok 64: Reaching the battle-field and abandoning their fear, all those monkeys, with their
thrilling martial arts full of pride, nay, who were having various weapons (like trees, rocks,
teeth and nails) and unrepressed in spirit, carried out battle with the demons.

Shlok 65: Seeing the monkeys rejoicing in that tumultuous battle which commenced and the
demons falling down, the great sages and troop of celestials emitted shouts of triumph.

Shlok 66: Meanwhile, mounting on a horse having speed equal to the wind, and taking a barbed
javelin, Narantaka entered the terrific army of monkeys, as a fish entering the ocean.

Shlok 67: That valiant and mighty Narantaka, the enemy of Indra, single-handedly within an
instant, rent asunder seven hundred monkeys with that shining javelin and killed that army of the
foremost of monkeys.

Shlok 68: Vidyadharas, the super natural beings and great sages, saw the mighty Narantaka,
seated on the back of a horse and hacking a path way for himself through the army of monkeys.

Shlok 69: His path-way was covered with a mire of flesh and blood, along with heaps of
fallen-down dead-bodes of monkeys, looking like hills.

Shlok 70: Whenever the foremost of the monkeys thought of showing their valour, so often
Narantaka overtook and cleaved them.

Shlok 71: He burn away the army of monkeys, as the fire burns away the forests. Even before
the monkeys get time to uplift the trees and mountains, the javelin struck them and they fell down,
as mountains riven by lightning.

Shlok 72- 73: That mighty Narantaka, the destroyer of men, roamed in all directions in the
battle-field, holding up his shiny javelin, ravaging in all directions like the wind ravaging the
earth in a rainy season.

Shlok 74: Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys with
his javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth.

Shlok 75: Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys with
his javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth.

Shlok 76: Those monkeys were unable to tolerate the down-onslaught of the javelin, which was
similar to the striking of a thunderbolt and they shouted with a great uproar.

Shlok 77: The images of the falling monkeys were flashing like those of falling mountains,
with their peaks shattered by a thunderbolt.

Shlok 78: Those great-souled and the foremost of monkeys, who were earlier thrown down by
Kumbhakarna, regained their self and approached Sugreeva.

Shlok 79: That Sugreeva, while looking on, saw the army of monkeys running away hither and
thither, as they were tormented of the fear of Narantaka.

Shlok 80: To that Sugreeva who was seeing his army running away, Narantaka appeared, coming
seated on the back of a horse, holding a javelin in his hand.

Shlok 81: After seeing Narantaka, the vastly splendoured Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spoke
thus, to Angada, the valiant prince, having a prowess equal to Indra's (as follows):

Shlok 82: "Go out and quickly detach the lives of this valiant demon, who is riding a horse
and consuming the army of his enemies."

Shlok 83: Hearing the words of Sugreeva his sovereign, that valiant Angada then came bouncing
from his army, as the sun coming out of a cloud.

Shlok 84: Angada the excellent of monkeys, resembling a rocky mass, wearing bracelets on his
upper arms, looked brilliant like a mountain with its metallic streaks.

Shlok 85: Angada the son of Vali, bereft of arms but only nails and teeth besides having a
great splendour, approached Narantaka and spoke the following words:

Shlok 86: "Stop! What can you do with these common monkeys? Throw your javelin, having the
sensation equal to a thunderbolt, towards my chest."

Shlok 87- 88: Hearing the words of Angada, Narantaka was very much enraged. The enraged Narantaka,
tightly biting his lip with his teeth, hissing like a serpent, approaching Angada and firmly
holding that highly radiant javelin, then quickly released it towards Angada. That javelin broke
against Angada's chest, that was as hard as a diamond and fell to the earth.

Shlok 89: Then seeing his javelin shattered, like a serpent whose powerful coils were cut off
by Garuda the eagle, Angada stretched out his palm and struck the head of the horse.

Shlok 90: That mountain-like Narantaka's horse, struck by a blow of the palm, had its head
shattered, feet broken, eyes and pupils put out and tongue come out. It fell down on the earth.

Shlok 91: Seeing his horse fallen down dead, Narantaka was enraged. Raising his fist, that
exceedingly powerful Narantaka in battle struck Angada on his head.

Shlok 92: Then, Angada having his head shattered by the blow of the fist, heavily oozed out
very hot blood, repeatedly felt a burning sensation and swooned. On regaining consciousness, he was
surprised.

Shlok 93: Thereupon, the great-souled Angada, the son of Vali, clinching his fist and then
with a force equal to death, rushed it against the chest of Narantaka.

Shlok 94: Having his chest deeply sunk back by that fist-blow, giving out flames and with his
limbs smeared by blood, that Narantaka fell down as a mountain is broken up by the fall of a
thundr-bolt.

Shlok 95: When that Narantaka of great prowess was killed by Angada in battle, the chiefs of
celestials and the monkeys too then emitted a great roar of triumph in the sky.

Shlok 96: Then, that Angada, who showed that forcible means, which was very difficult to do,
and which rejoiced Rama's intellect. So much so, Angada too was surprised. Thereupon Angada, of
terrible acts, was infused with vigour and again showed enthusiasm in battle.



SARGA 70
------------------------------

[Text] Mahodara, Trishira and Devantaka start attacking Angada. When Angada attacks them
with trees, they chop off the trees and break away the rocks hurled at them. With a blow of
Angada's palm, Devantakas's elephant falls down dead. Seeing Angada being surrounded by three
valiant demons, Hanuma and Neela arrive there. With a blow of Hanuma's fist, Devantaka dies.
Trishira and Mahodara attack Neela with their arrows. Mahodara dies in the hands of Neela.
Meanwhile, Hanuma and Trisira fight at each other. Hanuma finally kills Trishira, by chopping off
his three heads by Trishira's sword itself. Then, Mahaparshva, the demon comes to the battle field
and attacks Rishabha, the monkey-warrior. By banging Mahaparshva's mace on Mahaparshva Rishabha
kills him.

Shlok 1: Seeing Narantaka dying, Devantaka, Trishira and Mahodara the son of Pulastya the
foremost of demons, wept.

Shlok 2: Mounting an excellent elephant, resembling a cloud, Mahodara hurrily attacked Angada
of great energy.

Shlok 3: The strong Devantaka, tormented at his brother's calamity, then taking a terrific
iron rod, ran towards Angada.

Shlok 4: Thereupon, the valiant Trishira, mounting a chariot resembling the sun and yoked
with excellent horses, marched towards Angada.

Shlok 5: That Angada, being attacked by the three chief demons, who were capable of smashing
the pride of celestials, uplifted a tree with its large boughs.

Shlok 6: The valiant Angada hurled that large tree with big branches quickly on Devantaka as
Indra the lord of celestials would a blazing thunderbolt.

Shlok 7: Trishira chopped off that tree with arrows looking like serpents. Seeing the tree
chopped off, that Angada then sprang up.

Shlok 8: Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys streamed forth trees and rocks. The enraged
Trishara chopped them off with his sharp arrows.

Shlok 9: That Mahodra broke those trees with the tip of his club. Trishira too with his
arrows attacked the valiant Angada.

Shlok 10: Marching ahead quickly towards Angada on an elephant, the enraged Mahodara struck on
his chest with javelins looking like thunderbolts.

Shlok 11: Then, the enraged Devantaka with a speed, approached Angada, struck him quickly with
a club and went off to a distance.

Shlok 12: Eventhough attacked at the same time by those three foremost of demons, that Angada
of great prowess and splendour, did not get alarmed.

Shlok 13: The speedy and quite unconquerable Angada, acting with a great swiftness and
attacking well, struck Devantaka's elephant with his palm.

Shlok 14: By that blow of Angada in battle, the eyes of that royal elephant fell down and that
elephant died.

Shlok 15: Pulling out a tusk of that elephant in battle, the mighty Angada ran towards
Devantaka quickly and struck him.

Shlok 16: That energetic Devantaka swayed to and fro in disorder, like a tree being tossed up
by the wind and emitted plenty of blood with the colour of a lacquer.

Shlok 17: Thereafter, the strong Devantaka of great splendour, recovering his breath with a
great difficulty, then struck Angada violently, by firmly holding an iron rod.

Shlok 18: Then, Angada the son of king Vali, struck by the iron rod, fell down on his knees on
the earth, but again jumped up.

Shlok 19: While Angada, the son of Vali was jumping up, Trishira struck him with three
terrific and straight-going arrows on his forehead.

Shlok 20: Noticing Angada being surrounded by the three demon-warriors, Hanuma and Neela went
there.

Shlok 21: Thereupon, Neela then hurled a mountain-peak on Trishira. The intelligent Trishira
the son of Ravana broke it by using his sharp arrows.

Shlok 22: That mountain-peak, broken into pieces by a multitude of arrows, with its split up
rocks, fell down with sparks of fire and flames.

Shlok 23: Seeing Hanuma rushing with enthusiasm in the battle-front, that strong Devantaka ran
towards him with his iron rod.

Shlok 24: Then, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, while jumping up, struck on the head of
Devantaka rushing upon him with his fist equal to a thunder-bolt.

Shlok 25: Then, the valiant and the strong Hanuma struck him on his head. That great ape made
the demons shake with the sound.

Shlok 26: That Devantaka, the son of Ravana, with his head crushed and broken by the blow of
the fist, with his teeth and eyes coming out and with his tongue hanging down, swiftly fell down
dead on the earth.

Shlok 27: When that Devantaka the mighty chief of demon-warriors and the enemy of celestials
was killed in battle, the enraged Trishira showered a terrible rain of sharp-pointed arrows on
Neela's chest.

Shlok 28- 29: Again mounting an elephant resembling a mountain, as the sun mounting Mandara
Mountain, that enraged Mahodara on his part, caused rain of arrows to fall quickly on Neela, like
rumbling cloud with a circle of lightning, showers rain on a mountain.

Shlok 30: Thereupon, by the rain of a multitude of arrows, the body of Neela the commander of
the army of monkeys became blown up. Thus the mighty Mahodara then made his loosened limbs
paralyzed.

Shlok 31: After regaining consciousness, Neela uplifted a mountain consisting of a number of
trees and then jumping up with a great speed, struck with it on the head of Mahodara.

Shlok 32: That Mahodara, then shattered by the fall of that mountain and crushed by that large
elephant too, lost his life and fell down on the earth like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt.

Shlok 33: Seeing Mahodara his young paternal uncle killed. Trishira was enraged seized hold of
his bow and struck Hanuma with sharp arrows.

Shlok 34: While that enraged Hanuma hurled a mountain-peak, the strong Trishira broke it into
several pieces with his sharp arrows.

Shlok 35: Seeing that mountain-peak becoming useless, Hanuma then hurled a volley of trees
towards Trishira in that battle-field.

Shlok 36: The valiant Trishira chopped off that volley of trees descending on him, with his
sharp arrows in the sky itself and roared aloud.

Shlok 37: Then, the enraged Hanuma on his part, bouncing up, tore asunder with his nails,
Trishira's horse, as a lion tears asunder a large elephant.

Shlok 38: Thereupon, Trishira the son of Ravana seizing hold of a spear, as Yama the lord of
death takes in his service Kalaratri, a night of all-destroying time, hurled it on Hanuma.

Shlok 39: Capturing that spear coming like a meteor in the sky, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys
broke it, even without its descending on him and roared too.

Shlok 40: Seeing that spear of a terrific form broken up by Hanuma, the monkey-troops were
very much delighted and roared aloud like rumbling clouds.

Shlok 41: Thereupon, lifting up a sword, Trishira the foremost of demons them dug it into
Hanuma's breast.

Shlok 42: Hurt by the thrust of the sword, the valiant Hanuma the son of wind-god, struck
Trishira on his breast, with his palm.

Shlok 43: Struck by Hanuma's palm, that Trishira of great splendour fell down unconscious on
the earth with the weapons slipping from his hand.

Shlok 44: Hanuma, that large ape, equal to a mountain in size, snatching away that falling
sword of Trishira, roared loudly frightening all the demons there.

Shlok 45: Unable to bear that roar, the demon jumped up and struck Hanuma with his fist.

Shlok 46: Enraged as he was by the blow of Trishiras's fist, Hanuma seized hold of Trishira
the foremost of demons by his head covered by his diadem.

Shlok 47: That enraged Hanuma the son of wind-god chopped off with that sharp sword, his three
heads furnished with diadems and ear-rings, like Indra the lord of celestials chopped off the heads
of Vishvarupa the son of Tvashta.

Shlok 48: Those mountain-like heads of Trishira the enemy of Indra, having longish organs of
senses and having fire-like blazing eyes, fell down on earth, as planets and stars drop from the
track of the sun.

Shlok 49- 50: When that Trishira, the enemy of celestials, having a prowess equal to that of Indra
was killed, the monkeys made a loud noise. The earth trembled. Then, the demons ran away
everywhere. Seeing Trishira, Mahodara and the invincible Devantaka killed, Matta (Mahaparshva) was
enraged with indignation.

Shlok 51: Then, Mahaparshva was holding a large mace, which was resplendent, completely made
of iron, wound round with golden wires, filled with a froth of flesh and blood, satiated with the
blood enemies, the upper most part of which was blazing with splendour, decked with red coloured
garlands and which frightened the elephants supporting the quarters like Airavata, Mahapadma and
Sarvabhauma.

Shlok 54: Taking that mace, the enraged Matta, the foremost of demons, went quickly to the
monkeys like the blazing fire at the end of the world.

Shlok 55: Then, a strong monkey called Rishabha came jumping and stood in front of that
Mattanika (Mahaparshva), the younger brother of Ravana.

Shlok 56: Enraged in seeing that Rishabha, looking like a mountain, standing before him,
Mahaparshva struck him upon his breast with a mace equaling a thunderbolt.

Shlok 57: When he struck with his mace, the breast of that Rishabha the foremost of demons was
broken. He then trembled and exuded blood profusely.

Shlok 58: That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while and
enraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva.

Shlok 59: That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while and
enraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva.

Shlok 60: With his body drenched in blood, that Mahaparshva suddenly fell unconscious on the
ground, like a tree with its root cut off. Then, taking quickly Mahaparshva's mace, which was
looking like Yama's rod, he roared loudly.

Shlok 61: Mahaparshva remained as though he was dead for a while. Springing suddenly after
regaining his consciousness, that demon, whose colour resembled his consciousness, that demon,
whose colour resembled an evening cloud, struck that Rishabha, the son of Varuna the lord of
waters.

Shlok 62: That Rishabha fell unconscious for a while on the ground. Rising after regaining
consciousness and tightly holding just the same mace, which was looking like a large mountain-peak,
banged it on Mahapatra in the battle-field.

Shlok 63: That terrific mace, reaching the body of Mahaparshva, the fierce demon, the enemy of
celestials, sacrificial rites and Brahmanas, broke his chest. Mahaparshva started exuding copious
blood, as a supreme mountain exudes water full of minerals.

Shlok 64: The great souled Rishabha quickly ran towards the mace of that mighty Mahaparshva.
Seizing that dreadful mace and striking it repeatedly on the floor, he struck it on Mahaparshva in
the battle-front.

Shlok 65: Struck by his own mace, that Mahaparshva with his teeth and eyes fallen out, fell
down like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt.

Shlok 66: When that demon depleted his strength, burst open his eyes, with his long life gone
away and fallen down on the ground, the army of demons ran away.

Shlok 67: When that Mahaparshva was killed, that army of demons, which was as extensive as an
ocean, abandoning their weapons in the battle-field, fled for mere lives, like a sea which has
burst its shores.



SARGA 71

[Text] Seeing Atikaya, the colossal demon, coming towards him on a chariot, Rama asks
Vibhishana who he is Vibhishana introduces Atikaya, as being a son of Ravana and Dhanyamali
(another consort of Ravana). When some commanders of monkeys try to attack Atikaya, he chops off
trees and crags hurled at him. Without fighting further with the monkeys, Atikaya, moves forward to
Rama and challenges him for a fight. Then Lakshmana with his bow and arrows begins to fight with
Atikaya. By a sharp arrow struck by Atikaya in Lakshmana's chest, Lakshmana is enraged and releases
an arrow employed with a missile of fire and Atikaya attacks it with an arrow employed with a solar
missile. On the advice the wind-god appeared before him, Lakshmana finally hurls an arrow employed
with a missile of Brahma and chips off the head of Atikaya.

Shlok 1- 2- 3: Seeing his own army making a tumultuous sound tottering with excessive fear, seeing
his brothers having a prowess equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials having been killed, and
seeing his paternal uncles as also Yuddhonmatta and Matta (Mahodara and Mahaparshva) his brothers
and the foremost of demons having been fallen down, Atikaya of great splendour, having boons
bestowed by Brahma the lord of creation, having appearance of a mountain and who removed the pride
of celestials and ogres, was enraged.

Shlok 4: That Atikaya, the enemy of Indra the lord of celestials, mounting a chariot shining
like a cluster of thousand suns, ran towards the monkeys.

Shlok 5: Wearing a crown and well-cleansed ear-rings as also drawing his bow, he roared with
a big noise, making his name loudly heard.

Shlok 6: By that lion-like roar, making his name loudly heard and by that terrific sound of
the bow-string, it created terror to the monkeys.

Shlok 7: Seeing the bulkiness of his body, all the monkeys, thinking that Kumbhakarna woke up
again, took refuge with each other, afflicted as they were, with fear.

Shlok 8: Seeing his form appearing like Vishnu who strided over the three worlds in three
steps, the those renowned monkey-warriors with fear, ran away hither and thither.

Shlok 9: When Atikaya was to be attacked, the monkeys were bewildered in mind and sought in
the battle, a refuge with Rama, who affords protection.

Shlok 10: Then, Rama saw from a distance, Atikaya, who resembled a mountain in size, stationed
in a chariot, armed with a bow and rumbling like a cloud appearing at the time of universal
dissolution.

Shlok 11: Seeing that Atikaya, having a colossal body, Rama for his part was quite surprised
and after consoling the monkeys, spoke to Vibhishana (as follows):

Shlok 12: "Who is he, resembling a mountain in size, armed with a bow, brown-eyed and seated
in a spacious chariot yoked with a thousand horses?"

Shlok 13: He is shining like Lord Shiva surrounded by genii, with resplendent and sharp
spikes, with very sharply barbed javelins and lances.

Shlok 14: "He is shining like a lightening cloud and moving round with staffs which support
the banners of the war-chariot, appearing like tongues of the Time-Sprit."

Shlok 15: "Bows adhered with golden backs in his excellent chariot are shining on all sides
like a rainbow in the sky."

Shlok 16- 17: "That warrior of demons, the eminent of charioteers, making the battle-front to
shine, is coming in a chariot with the splendour of the sun, with arrows having gleams of
sun-beams, shining in ten directions and embellishing brilliance by an emblem of Rahu installed on
the point of his standard."

Shlok 18: "His triply curved, golden backed and decorated bow, having a rumbling sound of the
cloud, is shining like a rain-bow."

Shlok 19: "His large chariot, with its flag and emblem, with its axle-tree at the bottom, and
having the sound of a cloud's lightning, consists of four charioteers."

Shlok 20: Twenty quivers, ten terrific bows and eight bow-strings, golden and reddish brown in
colour, are abiding in his chariot."

Shlok 21: "On that chariot are hanging two swords, clearly measuring ten cubits in length and
provided with measuring four cubits, casting their splendour on his two sides."

Shlok 22: "This brave warrior, with a red garland adorning his neck, resembling a large
mountain black in colour and having a month as large as Death, looks like the sun veiled by a
cloud."

Shlok 23: "With his arms adorned with gold armlets, he shines like the Himalaya, the highest
mountain with its two lofty peaks."

Shlok 24: "His awfully dreadful face, with two ear-rings, is shining like a full moon
appearing between the two stars constituting the constellation, Punnarvasu."

Shlok 25: "O the long armed! Tell me who this foremost of demons is! On seeing him all the
monkeys, afflicted with fear, are running away in different directions."

Shlok 26: Thus asked by Rama, the prince having an unlimited splendour, that Vibhishana of
great brilliance, replied to Rama as follows:

Shlok 27: "The ten-necked king Ravana, having great brilliance, the brother of Kubera the lord
of wealth, doing terrific deeds and possessing a great power, is the lord of demons."

Shlok 28: "To him, there is a valiant son, equal to Ravana in combat, who serves elders,
holding that which is heard from them and skilled in the use of weaponry."

Shlok 29: "He is respected for his counsel, for his rides on the backs of horses and
elephants, for his drawing out of the sword and the bow, for his strategy winning over to his side
by sowing dissention negotiation and bribery and for his steering capacity of an army.

Shlok 30: "He is Atikaya, the son of Dhanyamali. Lanka is feeling fearless, by resting on his
arm."

Shlok 31: "He, who purified his soul by meditating on the universal soul, worshipped Brahma
the lord of creation, obtained missiles too and conquered the enemies.

Shlok 32: "Brahma, the lord of creation, granted a boon, exempting him from death at the hands
of celestials and demons as also this wonderful armour and the chariot shining like the sun."

Shlok 33: "He conquered the celestials and the ogres several times, destroyed Yakshas the
supernatural beings and defended the demons."

Shlok 34- 35: "He is Atikaya, who paralyzed the thunderbolt of the intelligent Indra with his
arrows. He struck down the noose of Varuna, the seizer of transgressors. This wise Ravana's son,
who is strong and the foremost of demons took off the pride of celestials and ogres."

Shlok 36: "O Rama, the foremost of men! Therefore let the effort to destroy him be made
quickly. Otherwise shortly, he will bring in destruction for our army of monkeys, with his
arrows."

Shlok 37: Entering the army of monkeys, the strong Atikaya then stretched his bow and roared
again and again.

Shlok 38: Seeing him with a terrific body, seated in the chariot, as the excellent one among
the charioteers, powerful chiefs of monkeys rushed towards him.

Shlok 39: Taking trees and mountain peaks, Kumuda, Dvivida, Mainda, Nila and Sharabha marched
forwards quickly to attack him at once.

Shlok 40: Atikaya of great splendour, the foremost among those skilled in weaponry, chopped
off their trees and crags with his arrows decked with gold.

Shlok 41: That strong and skilled Atikaya with a terrific body, struck all those monkeys,
facing in front of him in battle with arrows fully made of iron.

Shlok 42: Those overthrown monkeys, injured with their blown out bodies, by the shower of
Atikaya's arrows in that great battle, were unable to retaliate on him.

Shlok 43: That demon, who was arrogant of his youth, frightened that army of monkey-warriors,
as an enraged lion frightens a herd of deers.

Shlok 44: That chief of demons did not strike whomsoever of the monkey-warriors who were
unable to fight. That Atikaya, with his bow and quiver of arrows, going up quickly towards Rama,
spoke haughty words (to him) as follows:

Shlok 45: "I am seated in the chariot with arrows and a bow in my hand. I would not give
battle with any common warrior. He who has ability and energy can give his fight to me now and here
quickly."

Shlok 46: Hearing his words, Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies was enraged. Then, unable to
bear his words and smiling, he rose up quickly and took up his bow.

Shlok 47: The enraged Lakshmana, coming forward quickly and taking off an arrow from his
quiver pulled out his great bow in front of Atikaya.

Shlok 48: That twang of the bow of Lakshmana, filling the entire quarters, earth, sky and the
ocean, was angry, frightening the demons.

Shlok 49: Hearing the terrific twang of Lakshmana's bow, the strong Atikaya of great
splendour, was surprised.

Shlok 50: Seeing Lakshmana standing in front of him for the battle, Atikaya then was enraged
and taking a sharp arrow, spoke the following words:

Shlok 51: "O Lakshmana! You are still a boy. You are ignorant of a fight. Why do you wish to
fight with me, who is like Yama the Lord of Death? Go away."

Shlok 52: "Even the Himalayan Mountains or the sky or the earth would be unable to endure the
speed of arrows released by my arms."

Shlok 53: "You wish to arouse a fire of dissolution, when it is sleeping happily. Placing your
bow here, go back. Do not lose your life, by fighting against me."

Shlok 54: "If you do not go back, with an obstinance, then you rather stay back. Abandoning
your lives, you will reach the abode of Yama."

Shlok 55: "See my sharp arrows decked with pure gold, which can remove the pride of my enemies
and which are like the weapons of Ishvara the lord of destruction."

Shlok 56: "This arrow looking like a serpent will drink your blood as a lion drinks the blood
of an elephant. "Thus speaking, Atikaya was enraged and fixed an arrow on his bow.

Shlok 57: Hearing the words of Atikaya, filled with anger and arrogance in that battle-field,
Lakshmana was enraged. Thereafter, that Lakshmana, having a great strength wisdom and great glory,
also spoke as follows:

Shlok 58: "O the evil-minded! Just by uttering mere words, you cannot by a very important
person. People cannot become good persons, just by boasting of themselves. You rather show your
strength in me, who is standing with an arrow in hand and wielding a bow."

Shlok 59: "Reveal yourself by your deeds. You do not deserve to boast of yourself. A person
with valour alone is declared as a warrior."

Shlok 60: "You are seated in a chariot, with all the weaponry and wielding a bow. Show your
prowess either by your arrows or even by your weapons."

Shlok 61: "Thereupon, with sharp arrows, I shall strike down your head like a fruit of a
fan-palm, ripened by its time, is fallen down from its stalk by the gust of a wind."

Shlok 62: "Today, these arrows of mine decked with pure gold, will drink blood oozing forth
from the holes formed in your body by the sharp points of my arrows."

Shlok 63: "Thinking me to be a boy, you need not disregard me. Either as the boy or as the
aged, you indeed know me in battle-front as the god of Death. Vishnu, as a boy occupied the three
worlds just with his three strides, Didn't he?"

Shlok 64: Hearing the reasonable and highly meaningful words of Lakshmana, Atikaya was very
much enraged and took out an excellent arrow.

Shlok 65: Then, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Bhutas the spirits, Devas the celestials,
Daityas the demons, Maharshies the great sages and Guhyakas a class of demi-gods, all the great
souled ones saw that battle.

Shlok 66: Thereafter, the enraged Atikaya, stringing an arrow to his bow, dispatched it
towards Lakshmana, as though he were shrinking up the space in between.

Shlok 67: Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemy-warriors, chopped off that serpent-like sharp
arrow, which was falling down on him, with his crescent-pointed arrow.

Shlok 68: Seeing that arrow which was chopped off as a snake's hood severed into pieces,
Atikaya was very much enraged and fitted five arrows to his bow.

Shlok 69: That demon hurled those arrows towards Lakshmana. Even before they reached him,
Lakshmana chopped them off with his sharp arrows.

Shlok 70: Cutting off those arrows with his sharp arrows that Lakshmana, the destroyer of
enemy-warriors, took up a sharp arrow, as though it was blazing with a glow.

Shlok 71: Taking that arrow, Lakshmana harnessed it on his excellent bow, stretched it with
force and released it.

Shlok 72: That valiant Lakshmana, by a flat-jointed arrow released fully, struck it on the
forehead of that excellent demon.

Shlok 73: That arrow, sunken into the forehead of that terrible demon, smeared with blood,
appeared like a serpent-king on a mountain.

Shlok 74: The demon, tormented by Lakshmana's arrow, then trembled violently as when the
terrific town-gate of Tripura City, (built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth by
Maya for the demons) was struck by Shiva's arrow.

Shlok 75: That demon of great strength, recovering his breath, reasoningly reflected as
follows: "Well! By flying down an arrow, you have become a commendable enemy for me."

Shlok 76: Thus speaking with his mouth wide open, Atikaya bent down with his large shoulder,
ascended the top of his chariot and roamed about hither and thither by his chariot.

Shlok 77: Atikaya, the foremost of demons, seized hold of one, three, five and seven arrows
and fixed them to his bow, stretched it and released the arrows.

Shlok 78: Those arrows, released from the bow of Atikaya, the leader of demons, appearing as
Death, with golden shafts and shining like the sun, set the sky ablaze.

Shlok 79: Thereupon, Lakshmana coolly chopped off those gluts of arrows released by that
foremost of demons, by the multitude of his sharp arrows.

Shlok 80: That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantly
releasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest.

Shlok 81: That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantly
releasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest.

Shlok 82: Struck in battle by Atikaya in his chest, Lakshmana oozed out blood severely, like
the fluid exuding from a rutting elephant.

Shlok 83: That powerful Lakshmana, then quickly made himself freed from that arrow-head, took
up a sharp arrow and fixed it with a missile.

Shlok 84: When Lakshmana employed the missile of fire on his arrow, that arrow of the great
souled Lakshmana and as also the bow, caused a flame to blaze.

Shlok 85: Atikaya of great splendour took up a solar missile and employed it on that arrow,
having a golden shaft as also looking like a serpent.

Shlok 86: Meanwhile, Lakshmana hurled at Atikaya, that blazing and awful arrow employed with
that mystic missile as Yama the lord of Death would hurl his rod of destruction.

Shlok 87: Seeing that arrow charged with a mystic missile of fire, Atikaya the demon then
released the awful arrow charged with the solar missile.

Shlok 88: Those two arrows, having their points blazed in splendour, struck at each other in
the sky, like two enraged serpents.

Shlok 89- 90: Those two excellent arrows, eventhough they were both blazing, did not radiate any
longer on the earth's surface, in that they were without a flame and had been reduced to ashes.

Shlok 91: Thereupon, the enraged Atikaya released an arrow made of cane (a missile) presided
over by Tvasha (the architect of gods). Then, the valiant LakShmana chopped off that missile, by
his missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials.

Shlok 92: Seeing his arrow made of cane struck down, that young Atikaya was quite enraged and
fixed his arrow with a missile presided over by Yama the lord of retribution.

Shlok 93: Thereupon, Atikaya hurled that missile on Lakshmana. That Lakshmana struck it down
by a missile presided over by the wind-god.

Shlok 94: Then, the furious Lakshmana showered forth hails of arrows on Atikaya, as a rainy
cloud showers hails of down-pour.

Shlok 95: Reaching Atikaya, those arrows with the points of their shafts shattered on his
armour, adorned with diamonds and instantly fell on the earth's surface.

Shlok 96: Seeing those arrows becoming unsuccessful, the highly famous Lakshmana the
annihilator of enemy-warriors, showered forth arrows in thousands.

Shlok 97: Atikaya, that mighty demon, though deluged with a flood of arrows, was not agitated
in battle because of the inviolability of his armour.

Shlok 98: Atikaya released an arrow having a serpent-like form on Lakshmana. Struck by that
arrow on his vital parts, that Lakshmana, the tormentator of his enemies, felt unconscious just for
a moment.

Shlok 99- 100: Having regained his consciousness, the mighty Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemies,
with his flood of arrows threw down the flag-staff and killed the horses and the charioteer in
combat, with his four excellent arrows.

Shlok 101: Free from flurry, that Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, released those arrows, exactly
aiming at that demon, for the purpose of killing him.

Shlok 102: Lakshmana, the best among men, was not able to afflict any injury to Atikaya in
battle. Then, the wind-god came to him and spoke to him as follows:

Shlok 103: "He, endowed with a boon by Brahma the lord of creation, is cloaked by inviolable
armour. Split him with a missile of Brahma. He cannot be killed by any other means. The mighty
Atikaya, with that armour, cannot be destroyed by other missiles."

Shlok 104: Then, hearing the words of the wind-god, Lakshmana having a prowess equal to that of
Indra the lord of celestials, adjusting his arrow with a missile presided over by Vrahma, quickly
directed the arrow with a terrific force.

Shlok 105: While fixing that excellent missile on that superior sharp-pointed arrow by
Lakshmana, all the quarters, the sun, the moon, the great planets and the sky were frightened.
Earth also made an uproar.

Shlok 106: Having charged the missile of Brahma on that arrow with the feathers and all, equal
to a messenger of Yama the lord of Death over his bow, Lakshmana released that arrow looking like a
thunderbolt on Atikaya, the son of Ravana.

Shlok 107: Atikaya saw that arrow, released with augmented force by Lakshmana, moving so fastly
as the wind, having beautiful wings with variegated feathers and looking like a thunderous
thunderbolt, approaching him in battle.

Shlok 108: Seeing that arrow, Atikaya quickly struck with several sharp arrows. That
Lakshmana's arrow, with a speed equal to Garuda the eagle, thus reached Atikaya's proximity.

Shlok 109: Seeing that blazing arrow, looking like Yama the lord of Death and black in colour,
approaching him, Atikaya then struck it with spike, spear, mace, axe and arrows.

Shlok 110: Then, that arrow, blazing like fire, made in vain those weapons of wonderful form
and taking Atikaya's head, carried it away.

Shlok 111: That head with its diadem, chopped off by Lakshmana, quickly fell down on the
ground, like a peak of the Himalayan Mountain.

Shlok 112: Seeing Atikaya falling on the ground, with his clothes and ornaments scattered away,
all the surviving demons became perturbed.

Shlok 113: Many of those depressed demons, dejected as they were, showing fatigue born of
fighting, in their faces, suddenly began to shout loudly, with their voices in discordant
notes.

Shlok 114: As their leader was dead, the demons were then frightened and becoming indifferent
to fight, went running away all around, with their faces turned towards that City of Lanka.

Shlok 115: When the dangerous demon with the terrific strength was killed, the multitude of
monkeys then were endowed with a great delight, with their faces looking like full blown lotuses
and worshipped Lakshmana who got his desire fulfilled.

Shlok 116: Throwing down in battle, that Atikaya who was exceedingly strong and looking like a
cloud, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and while he was being worshipped by the multitude of
monkeys, thereupon quickly hastened towards the proximity of Rama.



SARGA 72
------------------------------

[Text] Having been informed that Atikaya, Dhumraksha, Akampana, Prahasta, Kumbhakarna and
other mighty demons are killed in battle, Ravana felt anxious. He is surprised as to how Rama and
Lakshmana got released from the bind of arrows, made by Indrajit, his son earlier. He feels that no
demon is capable of defeating Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva and Vibhishana. He enjoins demons to
protect the City of Lanka and even Ashoka garden, where Seetha has been kept in capture. He asks
the army not to be indifferent to the movements of the monkey-warriors. After issuing the necessary
instruction to his army, he enters deep into his palace and remains boarding over the loss of
Atikaya, his son.

Shlok 1: Hearing Atikaya having been killed in the hands of the great-souled Lakshmana,
Ravana was worried and spoke as follows:

Shlok 2- 3- 4: "Dhumraksha, who was greatly impatient Akampana who was excellent among all wielders
of weapons, Prahasta and Kumbhakarna were killed by Rama, who was unwearied in battle. The mighty
and valiant demons longing for battle, who conquer the adversaries, who was never defeated in
battle by the enemies they along with their enemies were killed. Many other mighty warriors.

Shlok 5: "That day, Indrajit, my son, whose strength and prowess are renowned, bound both
Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers with terrific arrows, on which boons had been conferred."

Shlok 6- 7: "That terrific bind of arrow cannot be released by any celestial or a mighty demon
or by Yakshas the supernatural beings or Gandharvas the celestial musicians or Pannagas the
serpent-demons. Rama and Lakshmana, the two brothers were released from that tie of arrows either
by their power or by their sorcery or by their marvel I do not know that."

Shlok 8: "All of those valiant demon-warriors set out for battle, at my command, were killed
by those exceptionally mighty monkeys."

Shlok 9: "I do not find any demon, who can destroy the valiant Rama along with Lakshmana,
Sugreeva and Vibhishana accompanied by their army in battle now."

Shlok 10: "By Rama's valour, the demons were destroyed. Alas! How great is Rama's strength!
How great is the power of his arrow!"

Shlok 11: "Some regiments of the army have to protect this City and even Ashoka garden where
Seetha is being guarded, vigilantly on all sides."

Shlok 12: "We should know the locations of army-regiments and also the places where persons
are exiting and entering at all times, again and again.

Shlok 13: "O demons! Stay on all sides with your respective armies. The various positioning of
those monkeys are to be watched."

Shlok 14- 15: "Indifference should not be shown to monkeys in any way at any time, either at
evening or at midnight or at dawn. You have watch whether the army of adversaries is fervently
active or advancing or staying where it was."

Shlok 16: Hearing those words of Ravana, all the mighty demons then precisely carried it out
forthwith in its totality.

Shlok 17: Having thus instructed all of them, Ravana the king of demons, suffering from
prickly sorrow and depression, penetrated deeply into his palace.

Shlok 18: Blazed as he was with a fire of anger, Ravana the mighty lord of demons, then
remained broading about the loss of his son (Atikaya) and also sighing again and again.



SARGA 73
------------------------------

[Text] Seeing Ravana, his father looking lamented after hearing the death of Ravana's sons
and brothers, Indrajit promises to destroy Rama and Lakshmana. He sets out, for the battle,
accompanied by his army. After reaching the battle-field, Indrajit performed a sacrificial ritual
there, duly making an oblation to the fire. After performing the sacrificial rite, Indrajit goes
himself invisible into the sky. Indrajit then showers multitude of arrows towards the monkeys and
the monkeys lose their consciousness. Indrajit tears asunder principal monkey-warriors by his maces
and arrows. Then, he rains a multitude of arrows of Rama and Lakshmana. Rama says to Lakshmana that
he along with Lakshmana can act as thought they fell unconscious, so that Indrajit can return to
Lanka, boasting of his laurels of victory. Grievously hurt on the battle field by the missiles of
Indrajit, Rama and Lakshmana along with the whole army of monkeys fell unconscious.

Shlok 1: Then, those surviving troops of demons hastily told Ravana that Devantaka, Trishira,
Atikaya and other foremost of demons had been killed.

Shlok 2: Thereupon, suddenly hearing of those who had been killed, Ravana the prosperous king
of demons, having his eyes filled with profuse tears; boarding over the terrific destroyal of his
son as also the death of his brothers, contemplated for long.

Shlok 3: Then, seeing Ravana the king, miserably submerged in a sea of sorrow, Indrajit,
Ravana's son, the best among charioteers, spoke to him as follows:

Shlok 4: "O father, the king of demons! You ought not to get embarrassed, while Indrajit is
alive. Anyone who is struck by Indrajit's arrows cannot indeed protect his life."

Shlok 5: "Today, you will see Rama along with Lakshmana, with their bodies undistinguished,
scattered and dead, lying down on the floor, with their limbs diffused all over."

Shlok 6: "Listen to Indrajit's promise, which is very firm, backed by valour and divine
blessing. Now itself, I will overwhelm Rama together with Lakshmana unfailing flood of arrows.

Shlok 7: "Now itself, Indra, Yama, Vishnu, Rudra, Sadhyas (a class of celestial beings), the
fire-god, the sun and the moon can see my unlimited prowess, like the terrific prowess of Vishnu
(in his dwarf incarnation as Vamana) in the enclosure where a sacrifice was being performed by
Bali, the demon-king."

Shlok 8: Thus speaking, that Indrajit, with an undepressed mind, after seeking permission
from the king, mounted his chariot with a speed equal to that of wind and yoked with excellent
donkeys.

Shlok 9: That greatly resplendent Indrajit, the annihilator of enemies, having ascended a
chariot looking like the chariot of the sun, quickly went to the battle-front.

Shlok 10- 11- 12- 13: Many mighty demons with terrific prowess, with joy, holding excellent bows in their
hands, carrying lances, sharp-edged spears, swords, axes and maces as also armed with Bhushundis
(probably a kind of fire arms), mallets, cudgels, Shataghnis (cylindrical piece of wood studded
with iron spikes) and iron rods, followed that great souled Indrajit. Some rode on the back of
elephants, some ascended excellent horses, tigers, scorpions, cats, donkeys and camels,
looking.

Shlok 14: That valiant Indrajit swiftly went to the battle-field with full blasts of couches
and kettle-drums.

Shlok 15: Indrajit, the tormentator of enemies, with a parasol white as a couch and the moon,
shone like the sky with the full moon.

Shlok 16: The valiant Indrajit, the foremost among all the wielders of bow and decked with
gold ornaments, was being fanned then with supremely charming whisks with handles of gold.

Shlok 17: Seeing that son setting out with a large army, that glorious Ravana, the king of
demons, spoke as follows:

Shlok 18: "O my dear son! There is no charioteer who can stand you as your rival. Indra the
lord of celestials was conquered by you. You can kill Rama, a mere human being, who is assailable.
How much more can I tell?" After hearing these words of Ravana Indrajit accepted his great
blessings.

Shlok 19: With that Indrajit, having a splendour equal to that of the sun and having no
warrior who can stand him as his rival, the City of Lanka shone, like the sky shining with the
sun.

Shlok 20: Reaching the battle-field, Indrajit of great splendour, the annihilator of enemies,
stationed his demons around his chariot.

Shlok 21: Then, that foremost of demons, having a radiance equal to that of fire, with
excellent sacrificial incantations, performed a sacrifice, as per rules, making an oblation to the
fire.

Shlok 23: That valiant leader of demons offered oblations to fire there, with garlands and
pounded sandalwood, including clarified butter and parched grain.

Shlok 23: That sacrificial rite was performed with weapons serving as reeds, chips of
Vibhishaka tree serving as fuel, then using red pieces of cloth and the sacrificial ladle made of
iron.

Shlok 24: Duly spreading fire with reeds (in the form of other weapons) accompanied by lances
there, Indrajit elapsed the neck of a live goat of dark hue (for offering it to the fire as an
oblation).

Shlok 25: From the great fire of flames, set ablaze by that offering having been thrown into
it acting at once without smoke, appeared such signs as had beckoned victory (of the past).

Shlok 26: The fire, resembling the molten gold, rising up on its own and having flames
revolving from left to right, accepted that oblation.

Shlok 27: Indrajit, who was skilled in the use of mystic missiles, invoked the missile
presided over by Brahma and charged it on his bow, chariot and all.

Shlok 28: While that missile was being invoked and the sacrificial fire propitiated, the
firmament including the sun, the moon, other planets and lunar mansions trembled with fear.

Shlok 29: Having propitiated offering in fire, Indrajit, having a splendour shining like the
fire, having a might similar to that of Indra, and possessing an unimaginable prowess, became
himself invisible in the sky, with the bow, arrows, sword, chariot, horses, charioteer and all.

Shlok 30: Then, the army of demons, extensive with horses and chariots, embellished by banners
and flags, set out with a desire to fight, roaring.

Shlok 31: They killed the monkeys in the battle-field with many wonderful and ornamental
arrows, possessing great velocity as also lances and goads.

Shlok 32: Seeing those demons, the most enraged Indrajit on his part spoke to them as follows:
"All of you fight enthusiastically with an intent to kill the monkeys."

Shlok 33: Roaring with a desire for victory, all those demons thereafter terribly rained
showers of arrows on monkeys.

Shlok 34: That Indrajit, on his part, along with his demons in the battle-field, destroyed the
monkeys with Nalika (broad-headed) arrows, steel arrows, maces and clubs.

Shlok 35: Those monkeys, wielding trees as their weapons, being struck in the battle-field,
quickly rained mountains and trees on Indrajit.

Shlok 36: Indrajit the son of Ravana, on his part, possessing great splendour and great
strength, was enraged and wounded the bodies of the monkeys.

Shlok 37: Bringing enormous delight to the demons that enraged Indrajit severed off the
monkeys by nines, fives and sevens with a single arrow.

Shlok 38: That most invincible chief of demons, with arrows decked with gold, having
brilliance equal to the sun, destroyed the monkeys in battle.

Shlok 39: Those monkeys, tormented by the arrows in battle, with their limbs severed, fell
down with their aspirations shaken, like the great demons fallen down by the celestials.

Shlok 40: Those excellent monkeys with anger attacked Indrajit, who was tormenting them like
the sun with his terrific ray-like the sun with his terrific ray-like arrows.

Shlok 41: Then, all the monkeys, with their bodies severed, having lost their consciousness
and perturbed as they were, having their limbs dampened with blood, took to their heels.

Shlok 42: Those monkeys, wielding mountains as their weapons, roaring in the battle field,
without turning back, abandoned their lives, showing their courage for the sake of Rama.

Shlok 43: Continuing to stay in the battle-field, those monkeys rained trees, mountain-peaks
and rocks on Indrajit.

Shlok 44: Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battles, kept off that great rain
of deadly hail of trees and rocks.

Shlok 45: Thereupon, the capable Indrajit with his arrows, identical of fire and looking like
serpents in battle, split the armies of monkeys.

Shlok 46: Indrajit struck Gandhamadana with eighteen sharp arrows and also struck Neela, who
was standing at a far-away place, with nine arrows.

Shlok 47: Indrajit having a great prowess, struck Mainda with seven arrows, which can tear
asunder vital parts and also struck Gaja with five arrows in battle.

Shlok 48: Indrajit then struck Jambavan with ten arrows and Nila with thirty arrows. He also
struck Sugreeva, Rishabha, Angada and Dvivida with sharp and terrific arrows endowed with boons and
made them breathless.

Shlok 49: That enraged Indrajit, then looking like an excited fire that is to destroy the
world, tormented other chiefs of monkeys too with many arrows.

Shlok 50: He harassed the armies of monkeys' fast-moving arrows looking like the sun in their
splendour.

Shlok 51: That enthusiastic Indrajit, with a great pleasure, saw that exclusive army of
monkeys, drenched in blood and tormented by a multitude of arrows.

Shlok 52- 53: Indrajit, the son of Ravana, possessing a great splendour power and strength, again
generating a terrific rain of arrows and weapons, destroyed the army of monkeys from all sides.

Shlok 54: Leaving off his army from that great battle-field and becoming invisible, Indrajit
advanced towards the monkeys and quickly rained terrific hail of arrows on those armies of monkeys,
as black cloud downpours the rain.

Shlok 55: In that battle, those mountain-like monkeys as victims of conjuring tricks with
their bodies torn into pieces by Indrajit's arrows and roaring as they were with discordant notes,
fell down on earth, like mountains struck by Indra's thunder bolt.

Shlok 56: Those monkeys in battle saw only arrows with pointed tips falling on the armies of
monkeys. They could not see there, that Indrajit the demon, the enemy of Indra, remaining concealed
by his conjuring trick.

Shlok 57: Then, the mighty Indrajit, the leader of demons, covered all the quarters with
hundreds of sharply pointed arrows, having splendour of the sun and tore asunder the
monkey-chiefs.

Shlok 58: Indrajit excessively rained on the army of monkeys' pikes, swords and axes, shining
like augmented and flaming fire and shooting forth incandescent flames with sparks.

Shlok 59: Struck by the Indrajit's arrows, shining brightly as fire, the monkey-commanders
then looked like Kimshuka trees bearing crimson flowers.

Shlok 60: Those excellent monkeys, torn asunder by that chief of demons, approaching at each
other and roaring in a discordant tone, fell down on the ground.

Shlok 61: Banged in the eyes by arrows, some monkeys looking up towards the sky, joined each
other and fell down on the floor.

Shlok 62- 63- 64- 65: With lances, spikes and sharp arrows, charged with sacred texts, Indrajit the
excellent demon struck all those foremost of monkeys, namely Hanuman, Sugreeva, Angada,
Gandhamadana, Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarshina, Mainda, Dvivida, Nila, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Kesari,
Hariloma, Vidyuddamshtra, Suryanana, Jyothimukha, a monkey called Dadhimukha, Pavakaksha, Nala as
also a monkey named Kumuda.

Shlok 66: Tearing asunder the principal monkey-warriors by maces and arrows, which were of
golden colour, that Indrajit rained a multitude of showers of arrows equal to sun's rays on Rama
and Lakshmana.

Shlok 67: Ignoring that showering rain of arrows, as though they are mere showers of rain,
that Rama of the most wonderful luster, looking around thoroughly, then spoke to Lakshmana as
follows:

Shlok 68: "O Lakshmana! This Indrajit, by a great missile, is throwing down our army of
monkeys and tormenting us incessantly with his sharp arrows."

Shlok 69: "How can the mighty and composed Indrajit on whom a boon has been bestowed by Brahma
and who has concealed his terrible form who stands with his weapons uplifted eventhough his body is
visible be killed in the battle today?

Shlok 70: "I think the self-born Brahma who is the source of the universe is inconceivable and
this missile is presided over by him. O wise one! Remaining undistracted in mind, you bear along
with me today the hail of arrows here."

Shlok 71: "Let this chief of demons, who is surpassing all, be covered with a multitude of
showers of arrows. This entire army of Sugreeva, whose leading warriors have fallen, looks no more
charming."

Shlok 72: "Finding both of us fallen unconscious without displaying any joy or anger as also
having desisted from fighting, Indrajit will certainly return to Lanka, after having obtained
laurels of battle in its beginning itself."

Shlok 73: Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana there became struck by a multitude of arrows of
Indrajit. That leader of demons also there, causing affliction to both of them, roared with a
thrill of rapture in battle.

Shlok 74- 75: Thus causing the army of monkeys along with Rama and Lakshmana to become despondent
in battle, that Indrajit, getting eulogized by the demons, quickly reached the city of Lanka which
was being protected by Ravana's arms. Then, Indrajit cheerfully informed all that had happened, to
his father.



SARGA 74
------------------------------

[Text] After having been struck by Brahma's missile released by Indrajit, Rama and
Lakshmana became unconscious. Sixty-seven crores of monkeys fainted. Hanuma and Vibhishana, however
in consciousness, roared about in the battle-front with torches in their hands, making a search of
Jambavan. They find Jambavan. Jambavan requests Hanuma to proceed to Himalayas, by crossing over
the ocean and to bring four important herbs, viz. Mrita Sanjivani, Vishalya karani, Suvarna karani
and Sandhani; so as to bring succour to the fainted army of monkeys. Hanuma begins his journey to
Himalayas and reaches Mount Rishabha, where the wonderful herbs exist. Hanuma searches for the four
wonderful herbs. But the herbs appear invisible for him. Hanuma uproots the mountain clothed with
the four celestial herbs and carries it along with him. Inhaling the odour of those herbs, Rama,
Lakshmana and all the monkeys regain their normal health.

Shlok 1: Then, in the battle-front, Rama and Lakshmana were knocked down senseless. The army
of monkey-leaders fainted. Sugreeva, Nila, Angada and Jambavan could not understand what to do.

Shlok 2: Seeing the entire army looking worried, Vibhishana, the best among the intelligent
ones, spoke the following matchless words, consoling the warriors of Sugreeva, the lord of
monkeys:

Shlok 3: "Honouring the spell sacred of Brahma the creator, the two sons of the venerable
Dasaratha have actually lost their free will and became dejected and have allowed themselves to be
knocked down by the missiles of Indrajit. Hence do not be afraid. There is no occasion for
despondency now."

Shlok 4: "This excellent missile, presided over by Brahma the creator, with never-failing
strength, was given to Indrajit by Brahma. Honouring it, Rama and Lakshmana the princes fell down
in battle. This not a time for despondency here."

Shlok 5: Then, the intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god, paying honour to the missile
presided over by Brahma and hearing the words of Vibhishana, spoke the following words:

Shlok 6: "Let us restore to confidence whosoever is in this army of energetic monkeys, after
having been struck by the missile."

Shlok 7: Both those valiant ones, Hanuma and Vibhishana, together at that time of the night,
roamed about in the battle-front, with torches in their hands.

Shlok 8- 9: Hanuma and Vibhishana saw the battle-field, covered on all sides, with
mountain-sized monkeys fallen with heir tails, arms, thighs, feet, fingers and heaps of heads
fractured with blood oozing from their limbs and urine flowing out. The earth was also covered with
flaming weapons fallen around.

Shlok 10- 11: Vibhishana and Hanuma saw Sugreeva, Angada, Nila, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Gavaksha,
Sushena, Vegadarshi, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha and a monkey called Dvivida, who were struck down on
the battle-field.

Shlok 12: Sixty seven crores of powerful monkeys were struck down by the cherished missile of
Brahma, the self-born creator, in the fifth and last period* of the day.

[Commentary] *The twelve hours of the day were commonly divided into five parts consisting of
six Ghatikas (or two hours and twenty four minutes) each. They were known by the names of PraataH
(early morning), Sangava (forenoon), Madhyaahva (midday), Aparaahna (afternoon) and Saayaahna
(evening).

Shlok 13: Hanuma, along with Vibhishana, began to search for Jambavan, while looking at the
terrific army (wounded by the arrows) which appeared like the tide of an ocean.

Shlok 14: Looking at Jambavan, the son of Brahma, who was naturally bequeathed with old age,
an elderly person, with his body conspicuous of hundreds of arrows and a valiant person looking
like an extinguishing fire, Vibhishana approached him and spoke as follows:

Shlok 17: "O Vibhishana, the leader of demons, with a great prowess! I am able to recognize
you by your voice alone. Pierced with sharp arrows, I am not able to see you with my eyes."

Shlok 18: "O Vibhishana, of good manners! Does Hanuma, the foremost among monkeys, because of
whom, Anjana (his mother) and the wind-god are his blessed parents survive, holding his life any
where nearby?"

Shlok 19: Hearing the words of Jambavana, Vibhishana spoke the following words, "why do you
enquire about Hanuman, passing over the venerable sons of Dasaratha?"

Shlok 20: "O venerable one! The exceptional affection, you are showing towards Hanuma, is not
being shown towards Sugreeva or Angada or even Rama."

Shlok 21: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Jambavan replied as follows: "O the foremost among
demons! Listen to me, why I am enquiring about Hanuma."

Shlok 22: "If that brave Hanuma is surviving, the whole army even if killed, is unhurt. On the
other hand, if Hanuma has given up is life, we are all dead, even though living."

Shlok 23: "O dear child! If Hanuma, who is equal to the wind and the fire in prowess,
survives; then there is a hope for all of us to survive.'

Shlok 24: Thereafter, Hanuma the son of wind-god approaching the elderly Jambavan, offered his
salutation, by grasping the feet of Jambavan with modesty.

Shlok 25: Hearing the voice of Hanuma, Jambavan, the foremost among monkeys, with perturbed
senses, considered himself as though born again.

Shlok 26: Thereafter, that Jambavan of great splendour spoke to Hanuma as follows: "Come on, O
foremost of monkeys! You ought to protect the lives of monkeys."

Shlok 27: "You are the great companion for these monkeys, by your copious prowess. There is no
other person. This is the appropriate time to show your prowess. I do not see any other person to
do it."

Shlok 28: "Cheer up the martial warriors of both monkeys and bears. Heal Rama and Lakshmana
from their arrow-wounds."

Shlok 29: "O Hanuma! You ought to go to Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, by traveling
higher and higher over the large ocean."

Shlok 30: "O annihilator of enemies! Thereafter, you will see there the Mount Rishabha, the
excellent mountain and the very much powerful peak of Kailasa, with a golden hue."

Shlok 31: "O valiant Hanuma! In the midst of these two peaks, you will see a blazing and
unequally brilliant herbal mountain, containing all kinds of herbs."

Shlok 32: "O foremost of monkeys! Sprouted on the head of that mountain, are four blazing
herbs. You can see them, illuminating the ten quarters."

Shlok 33: "You can see there, Mrita Sanjivani (capable of restoring the dead to life),
Vishalyakarani (capable of extracting weapons and healing all wounds inflicted by weapons),
Suvarnakarani (restoring the body to its original complexion) and Sandhani, the great herb (capable
of joining severed limbs or fractured bone)."

Shlok 34: "O Hanuma! Bring all those herbs quickly. O son of wind-god! Bring succour to the
monkeys, by injecting lives into them."

Shlok 35: Hearing the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the son of wind-god was infused with animated
strength, as the ocean gets animated with the force of the wind.

Shlok 36: Standing on the summit of Trikuta mountain and pressing the foremost of mountains
(with his feet), that valiant Hanuma appeared like a second mountain.

Shlok 37: Then, increasingly pressed and bent by Hanuma's feet, that mountain was not able to
bear its weight and sank.

Shlok 38: The trees on that mountain, pressed by Hanuma, fell to the ground and caught fire
due to rapidity of Hanuma. Its peaks also got broken.

Shlok 39: The monkeys were unable to stand on that excellent mountain, which started to reel,
while being pressed severely by Hanuma, as the trees standing on it and the rocks got broken.

Shlok 40: Confounded with panic, the City of Lanka, whose principal gates were broken, whose
houses and town-gates were shattered, appeared as though dancing at night.

Shlok 41: Pressing hard the mountain, Hanuma equal to a mountain, caused the earth along with
the ocean to shake.

Shlok 42- 43- 44- 45: From that mountain, Hanuma then ascended Mount Malaya, appearing as Mounts Meru and
Mandara, filled with several kinds of cascades, full of many trees and creepers, having Kamala and
Utpala lotuses blooming, visited by celestials and celestial musicians, having a height of sixty
Yojanas (four hundred eighty miles), frequented by Vidyodharas, a number of sages and Apsaras the
nymphs, filled with various kinds of animal-troupes and illuminated by many caves, Hanuma grew his
body, appearing like a cloud, bewildering Yakshas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras.

Shlok 46: Pressing the mountain hard with his feet, opening his terrific mouth which shone
like a submarine fire and frightening the demons, Hanuma roared loudly.

Shlok 47: Hearing his loud noise, roaring clamorously, the foremost of demons residing in the
City of Lanka, were not able to stir anywhere.

Shlok 48: Hanuma of terrific prowess, annihilator of his enemies, after offering salutation to
the ocean, made up his mind to embark on a prime act for the sake of Rama.

Shlok 49: Raising his tail which resembled on serpent, bending his back, contracting his ears
and opening his month which shone like a terrific submarines-fire, Hanuma jumped into the sky, with
a head long speed.

Shlok 50: By his velocity, he carried away a multitude of trees, mountains and some ordinary
monkeys. Driven up and away by the momentum generated from his arms and thighs, they fell down in
water when their speed diminished.

Shlok 51: Stretching his arms, looking like coils of serpents, that Hanuma vying with the
prowess of hostile Garuda the eagle, headed towards the excellent mountain of Himalayas, with gush
as though he was drawing away the four quarters.

Shlok 52: Beholding the sea, whose waves along with its water were made to agitate and all
whose creatures were caused to whirl round, Hanuma quickly speeded up, like the discuss loosed by
the fingers of Lord Vishnu.

Shlok 53: Gazing at the hills, flocks of birds, lakes, rivers, pools and excellent towns full
of people, that Hanuma with a speed equal to that of the wind-god his father, shot forth towards
Himalayas.

Shlok 54: That valiant Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of his father, whose fatigue was
gone, swiftly rushed, taking recourse to the orbit of the sun.

Shlok 55: With a great speed of wind, reverberating the four quarters with sound, Hanuma the
foremost of monkeys, hastened towards Himalayas.

Shlok 56: Remembering the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the great monkey with a terrific stride,
suddenly saw Mount Himalaya too.

Shlok 57: Hanuma went to Mount Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, embellished with various
kinds of cascades, many kinds of caves, mountain-streams and summits resembling an assemblage of
white clouds as also many kinds of trees.

Shlok 58: Having approached that great mountain having excellent overbearing summits, he saw
great holy hermitages, inhabited by a multitude of divine sages.

Shlok 59: He saw the abode of Brahma the lord of creation, Kailasa the abode of Shiva the lord
of dissolution, the abode of Indra the lord of celestials, the arrow-discharging place of Rudra,
the worshipping place of Hayagriva, the horse-faced form of Vishnu, the shining place at which
Brahma's head fell down, the sun-god and Kimkaras.

Shlok 60: He saw the abode of Agni the fire-god, the abode of Kubera (son of Visrava) shining
like the sun, the spot where the sun was tied down, the abode of Brahma, the abode of bow belonging
to Lord Shiva and the novel of the earth (containing the hole through which one can enter Patala
the nethermost subterranean region).

Shlok 61: He saw the gigantic Mount Kailasa, the rock of Mount Himalaya (on which Lord Shiva
is believed to have practiced austerities and abstract meditation) and Mount Rishabha, the lofty
golden mountain, which was highly illumined by the flaming herbs and the lord of mountains on which
all types of herbs grew.

Shlok 62: Seeing that mountain shining with a heap of fire, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who is
the envoy of Indra, was surprised to see that great mountain of herbs and then made a search for
the herbs.

Shlok 63: That Hanuma, the great monkey, having crossed thousands of yojanas, walked around
that mountain, searching for the heavenly herbs.

Shlok 64: Knowing then that somebody was coming in search of them, all the distinguished herbs
on that mountain disappeared from Hanuma's view.

Shlok 65: In not seeing them thus, that great souled Hanuma was enraged. He made a loud noise
in anger unable to bear it, Hanuma with his eyes as red as the fire, spoke the following words to
the prince of mountains.

Shlok 66: "O prince of mountains! Is it quite sure that you have not shown any compassion for
Rama? If it is so, overcome by the strength of my arms; find yourself shattered to pieces
today."

Shlok 67: Fiercely seizing hold of the top of that mountain, furnished with thousands of
minerals, with its trees, elephants and gold, with the projections of mountain shattered and the
crest of its plateau set on fire, at once sprang up with speed.

Shlok 68: Having uprooted that mountain, frightening the worlds together with the leaders of
celestials and demons inhabiting them and being praised by many aerial beings, Hanuma sprang up
into the sky and proceeded expeditiously with the terrible speed of Garuda the eagle.

Shlok 69: Grasping that mountain-peak, radiant as the sun, that Hanuma who resembled the sun,
having reached the orbit of the sun, shone as a second sun (as sun's image) in the vicinity of the
sun.

Shlok 70: In the sky, with that mountain in his hand, that Hanuma the offspring of the
wind-god, who resembled a mountain himself, appeared mostly like Vishnu with his flaming discuss
with its thousand edges holding his hand.

Shlok 71: Then, seeing Hanuma, the monkeys made a noise. Seeing them, Hanuma in turn roared in
delight. Hearing their awfully excessive noises the inhabitants of Lanka roared still more
terribly.

Shlok 72: Thereupon, the great souled Hanuma descended on that prince of mountains (Trikuta)
in the midst of that army of monkeys. Having offered salutation to the illustrious monkeys there
with his head bent low, he then embraced Vibhishana

Shlok 73: By inhaling that fragrance of those great herbs, both Rama and Lakshamana became
healed of their wounds then and there. Other monkey-warriors rose up.

Shlok 74: By the fragrance of those most powerful herbs, all those monkey-warriors who were
earlier dead were healed momentarily of their wounds, relieved of their pain, even as those who are
asleep fully get up at the close of night.

Shlok 75- 76: From the day the monkeys and demons began to fight in Lanka, from that day onwards,
under the orders of Ravana, all those demons, who were being killed by the foremost of monkeys were
being thrown away into the sea as and when they were killed, merely or the sake of honour (so that
their number may not be known to the monkeys).

Shlok 71: Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god, with a great speed, carried away that mountain of
herbs quickly back to the mountains of Himalayas and again joined Rama.



SARGA 75
------------------------------

[Text] King Sugreeva asks Hanuma to arrange for setting ablaze the City of Lanka. With
torches in their hands, some monkeys throw fire to all parts of Lanka. The City, burnt by the
monkeys within a short time, assumed like the earth burning at the time of a terrific dissolution
of the world. Getting healed of their wounds, Rama and Lakshmana take their bows to resume
fighting. Gates and buildings in the city are tumbled down by Rama's arrows. Ravana gets enraged
and sends Kumbha and Nikumbha the sons of Kumbhakarna along with other demons to the battle. A
terrific fighting ensure between the monkeys and the demons. All the monkeys finally surround the
army of demons in all sides.

Shlok 1: Then, Sugreeva of great majesty, the king of monkeys spoke (the following)
meaningful words to Hanuma, in order to inform him what they should do next.

Shlok 2: "Since Kumbhakarna and his four sons were killed, Ravana cannot give any defense
now".

Shlok 3: "Let those dexterous monkeys, possessing the strength of lions, taking torches in
their hands, rush towards Lanka quickly, in order to set ablaze the abode of Ravana."

Shlok 4: Then at the sunset of that awful evening, those foremost of the monkeys, went
towards Lanka, with torches in their hands.

Shlok 5: When the troops of monkeys, with torches in their hands, attacked Lanka on all
sides, the diversely eyed demons who were holding the position of guards, suddenly fled away.

Shlok 6: Those monkeys, feeling gladdened, threw fire to the towering gates, attics, streets,
various byways and mansions.

Shlok 7: Then, the fire consumed thousands of houses of demons. Mansions of mountainous forms
fell down on the ground.

Shlok 8: Aloe, excellent sandalwood of great value, pearls, glossy gems, diamonds and corals
were burnt there.

Shlok 9: Linen, charming silk, blankets of sheep's wool, various kinds of ram's wool, gold
ornaments and weapons were burnt there.

Shlok 10: The ornaments, saddles etc. of diverse and peculiar designs of horses, the chains
worn round the neck of the elephants as also their girths and polished ornaments meant for the
chariots were also burnt.

Shlok 11: Coats of mail of the warriors, the armour of the elephants and horses, swords, bows,
bow-strings, arrows, lances, goads and javelins were burnt there.

Shlok 12- 13: The fire raging on all sides burnt blankets and rugs made of the hair of animals,
whisks made of the hair of the tails, the skins of tigers, many birds, palaces inlaid with pearls
and gems and various kinds of stores of arms.

Shlok 14- 15- 16- 17- 18: Then, the fire burnt away many kinds of bright coloured houses of all demons, who
were greedily desirous of their homes. The fire there burnt away hundreds and thousands of
inhabitants of Lanka, who were protected by gold coloured armoury and decked with garlands,
ornaments and garments, with quivering eyes due to inebriation, moving with lustful walking, who
were seized with fury against their enemy, who carried maces, pikes and swords in their hands, who
were eating and drinking too or lay fast asleep on splendid beds with their loved ones and who were
decamping quickly to all sides, taking their sons with them, frightened and fearing up again and
again.

Shlok 19- 20- 21: The fire there burnt away the houses, which were strong, very valuable, with
profound qualities, decked in gold with moon shapes and crescent shapes, which rose high with their
top rooms, provided all round with beautiful windows, furnished with seats coaches etc., decorated
with gems and corals, as though touching the sky, rendered noisy with notes of herons, peacocks,
veena the Indian lute and the jingling of ornaments as also appearing like mountains.

Shlok 22: Surrounded by fire, the arch-ways shone like a collection of clouds bound by
lightning, at the end of a summer season.

Shlok 23: The houses, surrounded by fire shone like the peaks of a large mountain, ignited by
a forest-fire.

Shlok 24: Getting scorched in fire, beautiful women, while lying fast asleep in their
seven-storeyed mansions, gave up all connection with their ornaments and screamed loudly, saying
"ah! Alas!"

Shlok 25: The houses too, surrounded by fire there, fell down like peaks of a great mountain,
struck by the thunder-bolt of Indra.

Shlok 26: Those houses, while being burnt, shone, from afar, like the peaks of Himalayas being
consumed by fire on all sides.

Shlok 27: That City of Lanka at night with its house-tops being burnt ablaze with flames,
looked like Kimshuka trees in full bloom.

Shlok 28: With their elephants let loose by the superintendents of the elephants and horses
too set free, Lanka was like an ocean, with roaming alligators in it at the end of a
world-cycle.

Shlok 29: Here, seeing a horse being let loose, an elephant went back frightened. There,
seeing a frightened elephant, a horse turned back with an alarm.

Shlok 30: While Lanka was being burnt, the great ocean, with its image reflected on its
waters, assumed like a great sea with red waters.

Shlok 31: That City burnt by the monkeys, within a short time, became transformed like the
earth burning at the time of terrific dissolution of this world.

Shlok 32: The noise of the women-folk, who were burnt by fire and covered with smoke, roaring
loudly, was heard upto one hundred Yojanas (or eight hundred miles).

Shlok 33: Then the monkeys, eager to fight, bounced suddenly upon the other demons, whose
bodies had been severely burnt and who rushed out (to save their lives).

Shlok 34: The loud noise made by the monkeys and the cry of the demons caused resounding of
all the ten quarters, the ocean and the earth.

Shlok 35: Healed of their wounds and unperplexed, both those great souled princes, Rama and
Lakshmana seized hold of those two excellent bows.

Shlok 36: Thereupon, Rama pulled his excellent bow, making a tumultuous twang, which struck
terror in demons.

Shlok 37: Rama, drawing his great bow, was as shining at that time as Lord Shiva (the source
of Universe), stretching his bow, consisting of the Vedas in a great wrath (as at the time of
dissolution of the Universe).

Shlok 38: The twang of the bow-string of Rama could be heard above both of those sounds. The
sound of the monkeys and the cry of the demons.

Shlok 39: The raised voice of the monkeys, the cry of the demons and even the twang of Rama's
bow-string these three sounds pervaded all the ten quarters.

Shlok 40: By the arrows released from Rama's bow, the main gate of that City looking like a
peak of Mount Kailasa, tumbled down, shattered, to the ground.

Shlok 41: Thereupon, seeing Rama's arrows descending on seven-storeyed mansions and other
houses, the war-preparedness of the leaders of demons got disturbed.

Shlok 42: To those demoniac leaders, who were preparing for the battle and emitting lion's
roars, that night became a night of final dissolution (presided over by Rudra, the lord of
destruction).

Shlok 43- 44: The monkey-chiefs were commanded by Sugreeva as follows: "O monkeys! Approaching the
nearest gate, begin to wage the war. Even though present at the scene of fighting, he among you who
proves futile by an escape, should be overtaken and killed as he will be quality of disobeying the
royal command."

Shlok 45: Seeing those monkey-chiefs, standing at the gate, with flaming torches in their
hands, Ravana was enraged with fury.

Shlok 46: All the ten directions were distracted because of Ravana's act of disorderly
movement of his body due to yawning and he looked like the wrath manifest in the limbs of Rudra
appearing with a form.

Shlok 47: The enraged Ravana sent both Kumbha and Nimkumbha, the sons of Kumbhakarna, along
with a multitude of demons.

Shlok 48: By the orders of Ravana, Yupaksha, Shonitaksha, Prajangha and Kampana along with the
aforesaid sons of Kumbhakarna set out for the battle.

Shlok 49: Ravana instructed all those mighty demons thus, "O demons! Proceed now itself,
bellowing a lion's roar."

Shlok 50: Incited by Ravana, the valiant demons then, wielding shining weapons and roaring
repeatedly, sallied forth from Lanka.

Shlok 51: By the gleams of ornaments worn by their own natural splendour, those demons and
monkeys with their fires, made the sky fluorescent on all sides.

Shlok 52: The effulgence of the moon there, the light of the stars and the splendour of the
ornaments of both the armies, while blazing, made the sky brilliant.

Shlok 53: The effulgence of the moon, the splendour of the ornaments and the fluorescence of
the blazing planets made the armies of monkeys and demons glitter on all sides.

Shlok 54: With the flames of the half-scorched houses there, the ocean on its part with its
agitated waves mingled with water, shone abundantly.

Shlok 55- 56- 57- 58: That army of demons was looking awful with flags and banners, with excellent axes
shaped like swords, consisting of terrific horses, chariots and elephants, crowded with
foot-soldiers of every description, distinguished by shining pikes, maces, swords, spears, lances
and bows, noted for its redoubtable valour and prowess, with shining lances and rendered noisy by
hundreds of tiny bells (tied around chariots, elephants etc), the arms of its warriors adorned with
sets of gold ornaments, their axes being brandished, mighty weapons being waved about, arrows
fitted to the bows and the whole atmosphere rendered fragrant by the abundance of sandal paste,
garlands and wine.

Shlok 59: Seeing the army of demons, which came crowded with gallant warriors, thundered like
a huge cloud which was difficult to assail, the army of monkeys marched forth and made a loud
noise.

Shlok 60: That large army of demons on its part went springing forward with all speed, towards
the hostile army, as moths towards a flame.

Shlok 61: The excellent army of those demons, in which iron clubs and the tips of missiles
being brandished through the action of their arms, shone all the more brightly.

Shlok 62: Thereafter, the monkeys desirous to fight there, striking the demons with trees,
rocks and fists, jumped up as though frenzied.

Shlok 63: Likewise, the demons with their terrific prowess instantly tore off the heads of
those monkeys bouncing upon them, with sharp arrows.

Shlok 64: The demons there strolled in the streets of Lanka, with their ears bitten off with
teeth, their skulls smashed with fists and their limbs broken by crag blows.

Shlok 65: Even so, some demons with terrific form struck those chiefs among the monkeys, with
sharp swords, on all sides of the battle field.

Shlok 66: One warrior killed the one who was killing another, a second one threw down the one
throwing down another; a third one scolded another who was scolding the other one; while a fourth
one chewed the one chewing another.

Shlok 67: There, one said "Give me the blow. Another said, "He is giving". Yet another said,
"I am giving" some talked with one another, saying "Wait. Why do you take pains?"

Shlok 68- 69: In that very terrific war between monkeys and demons, some weapons were made futile.
Some weapons were dug into armours. Long lances were lifted up. Fists, pikes, swords and spears
were used as weapons of war.

Shlok 70: In the battle-front, the demons killed monkeys in tens and sevens. The monkeys too
threw the demons down in tens and sevens.

Shlok 71: Catching hold of the army of demons, whose hair and raiment's were kept in order
with difficulty and whose armours and standards were thrown away, the monkeys surrounded them on
all sides.

[Text] Angada kills Kampana and severely injures Shonitaksha, the demons in battle. Angada,
along with Mainda and Dvivida the monkey-warriors encounter Shonitaksha, Yupaksha and Prajangha.
Angada kills Prajangha. Shonitaksha dies in the hands of Dvivida and Youpaksha at the hands of
Mainda. When Kumbha throws down Angada in the battle-field, Rama sends some more monkey-chiefs
headed by Jambavan. Sugreeva, with his thunderbolt-like fist, strikes Kumbha with a heavy blow and
kills him.

Shlok 1: While that terrific battle, which destroyed many eminent heroes, was in progress,
Angada, who was eager to fight, attacked the valiant Kampana.

Shlok 2: Calling Angada to fight, Kampana with fury, rapidly struck him with a mace in
anticipation. Violently hit by him, Angada was reeled.

Shlok 3: Restoring consciousness, the energetic Angada hurled a mountain peak. Tormented by
that stroke, Kampana fell down on the ground.

Shlok 4: Then, seeing Kampana killed in battle, Shonitaksha fearlessly rushed there towards
Angada quickly in a chariot.

Shlok 5- 6: He then swiftly struck Angada with sharp pointed arrows which can tear up the limbs
and with fire-like forms which can destroy the world. He struck with many sharp arrows by the names
of Kshura, Kshurapra, Naaraacha, Vatsatanta, Shilimukha, Karni, Shalya and Vipatha.

Shlok 7: The strong and powerful Angada, the son of Vali, with his wounded limbs, crushed his
terrific bow, chariot and darts with his might.

Shlok 8: Then, Shonitaksha quickly took a sword and a shield. Enraged as he was, he swiftly
jumped down (from his chariot) unhesitatingly.

Shlok 9: Springing forward more swiftly, seizing hold of him with his hand and snatching away
the sword, the strong Angada made a lion's roar.

Shlok 10: Angada the foremost of monkeys the sword into the flat surface of his shoulder and
cut him from left to right diagonally.

Shlok 11: Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards the
other surviving enemies in the battle-front.

Shlok 12: Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards the
other surviving enemies in the battle-front.

Shlok 13: That valiant Shonitaksha, wearing golden armlets, restoring his consciousness, took
an iron mace and rushed quickly towards the same Angada.

Shlok 14: The strong and the great warrior, Prajangha on his part, along with Yupaksha, was
enraged and rushed towards the mighty Angada with his mace.

Shlok 15: Angada, the chief of monkeys, between the two warriors, Shonitaksha and Prajangha,
shone like a full moon between the two asterisms known as Vishakhas.

Shlok 16: Protecting Angada, Mainda and Dvivida took their position near Angada, with an
intent to exhibit each of their own martial skill.

Shlok 17: The mighty demons with their colossal bodies retaliated and rushed in anger,
wielding swords, arrows and maces, towards the monkeys.

Shlok 18: A great battle, causing hair to stand on end, was waged by the three monkey-chiefs
who encountered the three excellent demons.

Shlok 19: In the battle-field, the monkeys, seizing hold of trees, hurled them against the
demon-chiefs. The mighty Prajangha, however, cut them down with his sword.

Shlok 20: The monkeys in the battle-field hurled trees and rocks towards chariots and horses.
The mighty Yupaksha chopped them off with a flood of arrows.

Shlok 21: Shonitaksha, the valiant and the powerful demon, chopped off the trees uplifted and
hurled by Dvivida and Mainda with his mace in the midway itself.

Shlok 22: Prajangha, lifting a large sword, which can chop off vital parts of the enemies,
rushed swiftly towards Angada.

Shlok 23: Then the mighty Angada, who was exceedingly strong, seeing him coming nearer, struck
him with an Ashvakarna tree.

Shlok 24: Angada struck, with his fist, the arm of Prajangha, holding the sword. By that blow,
the sword fell on the ground.

Shlok 25: Seeing that sword looking like a pebble (in shape), which fell on the ground, the
mighty Prajangha tightened his thunderbolt like fist.

Shlok 26: When that Prajangha of great splendour struck Angaa, the excellent monkey with a
great strength on his forehead, Angada shuddered for a moment.

Shlok 27: That Angada of splendour and prowess, restoring his consciousness, struck with his
fist and shattered Prajangha's head off his trunk.

Shlok 28: That Yupaksha, with tears filled in his eyes because of the death of his paternal
uncle in battle, quickly took a sword as his arrows were exhausted and descended from his
chariot.

Shlok 29: Seeing that Yupaksha rushing on him, Dvivida hurriedly struck Yupaksha on his chest
and with a rage, forcibly caught hold of him.

Shlok 30: Seeing his mighty brother being seized, Shonitaksha, of great splendour, then struck
Dvivida on his chest.

Shlok 31: That mighty Dvivida, struck by Shonitaksha was tottered; but pulled off the
platter's mace when lifted again on him.

Shlok 32: Meanwhile, Mainda came nearer to Dvivida and banged Yupaksha on his chest with his
palm.

Shlok 33: Those two demons, Shonitaksha and Yupaksha, who were full of violence, carried on a
keen contest with the two monkeys in the battle field, by pulling and overthrowing them vehemently
and severely.

Shlok 34: The valiant Dvivida, after splitting open shonitaksha's face with his claws, threw
him down on the floor by his strength and crushed him down.

Shlok 35: Mainda, the foremost of monkeys, was enraged and pressed Yupaksha with his arms.
Yupaksha fell down dead on the ground.

Shlok 36: That army of demons, which was perturbed with their great warriors killed, then
moved with its face turned towards the place where Kumbha (the son of Kumbhakarna) was carrying on
battle.

Shlok 37- 38: Kumbha, restored to confidence, that army which was coming towards him with speed.
Then, seeing the army of demons whose chief-warriors were thrown down by the most powerful monkeys
who could fulfill their aim, the powerful Kumbha then performed a great feat which was very
difficult to do in a battle.

Shlok 39: That Kumbha, the foremost among the wielders of bow, taking his bow and fully
composed, released serpentine arrows which can split open the bodies.

Shlok 40: That excellent bow of his, fitted with an arrow, shone like a second bow of Indra
(the rain-god), illumined by flashes of lightning and the splendour of Airavata (the elephant
carrying Indra on its back).

Shlok 41: By that arrow with a golden shaft and fastened with feathers, drawn upto his ear and
discharged, he then struck Dvivida.

Shlok 42: Suddenly struck by that arrow, that excellent monkey possessing a splendour of Mount
Trikuta, was perturbed, with his feet swaying to and fro and fell down throbbing.

Shlok 43: Beholding his brother defeated in that great battle, Mainda there on his part,
taking a large rock, rushed with speed to attack the demon.

Shlok 44: While that mighty Mainda hurled that rock towards the demon, Kumbha broke that rock
into pieces with his five shining arrows.

Shlok 45: Stretching another arrow resembling a serpent and with a good pointed tip, Kumbha of
a great splendour, struck it on the chest of Mainda the brother of Dvivida.

Shlok 46: As that blow of Kumbha's arrow struck that Mainda, the monkey-chief, on his vital
parts, he fell unconscious on the ground.

Shlok 47: Seeing both his mighty maternal uncles wounded, Angada rushed speedily towards
Kumbha, who was standing with his bow uplifted.

Shlok 48: With five steel arrows and with three other sharp-edged arrows, Kumbha pierced that
Angada advancing towards him, as on would pierce an elephant with goads.

Shlok 49: That valiant Kumbha pierced Angada with a multiple of sharp arrows, decked in gold,
with edges which were harsh and sharp.

Shlok 50: Angada, the son of wind-god, though pierced all over the body with sharp arrows, was
however not shaken. He showered a rain of rocks and trees on Kumbha's head.

Shlok 51: The glorious Kumbha the son of Kumbhakarna chopped off all those trees hurled by
Angada and burst off the rocks further.

Shlok 52: Seeing Angada the monkey-chief rushing upon him, Kumbha pierced his brows with his
brows with his arrows, as an elephant would be struck with flaming torches.

Shlok 53: Since Angada's blood was oozing out, his eyes were covered with blood; Covering his
eyes, dampened with blood, with one hand, he caught hold of a Sala tree nearby with another
hand.

Shlok 54: In the battle-field, propping that tree with branches and all, on his chest, holding
it with his hand and bending a little, Angada uprooted it from the ground.

Shlok 55: While all the demons were looking on, Angada hurled that tree-which was tall like
Indra's banner and resembled Mount Mandara in size.

Shlok 56: That Kumbha chopped off that tree with seven sharp arrows which were capable of
splitting asunder the body. That Angada was very much perturbed and fell down, swooning.

Shlok 57: Seeing the unconquerable Angada fallen down and sinking into depression as though in
an ocean, the monkey-chiefs informed the matter to Rama.

Shlok 58: Hearing of Angada being seized with anguish in that great combat, Rama sent out for
help, leaders of monkeys, headed by Jambavan.

Shlok 59: Hearing Rama's message, those excellent monkeys were very much enraged and quickly
rushed towards Kumbha who was wielding a bow in his hand.

Shlok 60: With an intent to defend Angada, the monkey-chiefs then holding trees and rocks in
their hands and with their furious blood-red eyes, rushed on.

Shlok 61: The enraged Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi, the monkey ran up towards Kumbha the
son of Kumbhakarna to attack him.

Shlok 62: Seeing those mighty monkey-chiefs coming nearer to him, Kumbha covered them with a
flood of arrows, as one would obstruct the course of a stream by means of a rock.

Shlok 63: Reaching the range of his arrows, the great souled monkey-chiefs were unable even to
look at him, much less advance towards him, any more than a great ocean would overstep its
shore.

Shlok 64- 65: Seeing those troops of monkeys being tormented by a flood of arrows, Sugreeva the
king of monkeys, keeping Angada his brother's son in the rear, rushed headlong towards Kumbha in
the battle, as a swift lion would bounce upon an elephant walking along the slopes of a
mountain.

Shlok 66: Uprooting many large trees beginning with Ashvakarna and many kinds of trees,
Sugreeva the king of monkeys hurled them on Kumbha.

Shlok 67: The illustrious Kumbha, the son of Kumbhakarna, with his sharp arrows, chopped off
that down pour of trees, which was obscuring the sky and which was difficult to be assailed.

Shlok 68: The trees, chopped off with his sharp arrows by the brutal Kumbha, skilled in
hitting his target, shone like terrific Shataghnis (stones or cylindrical pieces of wood studded
with iron spikes).

Shlok 69: Seeing that shower of trees chopped off by Kumbha, the mighty and illustrious
Sugreeva of valour was not disturbed.

Shlok 70: Enduring those arrows being hit, Sugreeva snatched away Kumbha's bow, possessing the
splendour of a rain-bow and broke it all at once.

Shlok 71: Thus bouncing swiftly and doing that most difficult task, the enraged Sugreeva spoke
(as follows) to Kumbha, who was looking like an elephant with a broken tusk.

Shlok 72: "O Kumbha, the elder brother of Nikumbha! Both your prowess and the swiftness of
your arrow are wonderful. Both Ravana and you are equal in complaisance towards demons and the
majesty too exists.

Shlok 73: "O Kumbha, the compeer of Prahlada, Bali, Indra (the destroyer of the demon Vritra),
Kubera (the god of riches) and Varuna (the god of water)! You alone are born with a likeness of
your father (Kumbhakarna) who was exceedingly strong."

Shlok 74- 75: "The celestials cannot surpass even you alone, with a spike in hand, who can destroy
the enemy with your large arms, as mental agonies cannot overwhelm the one who subdued his senses.
Hence, exhibit your prowess, O demon of great intellect and see my exploits."

Shlok 76: "Because of the boon received by him, Ravana your uncle is able to attack the
celestials and demons. But Kumbhakarna (your father) on his part is tolerating the celestials and
demons."

Shlok 77: "You are equal in archery to Indrajit and in prowess to Ravana. Hence, you are now
the foremost in strength and heroism among the demon-folk."

Shlok 78: "Let the created beings see your great wonderful fight with me in the battle field
today, as they saw that fight between Indra and Shambara, the demon."

Shlok 79: "You have performed an incomparable task. You have also shown your skill in missile
weaponry. You have struck down these monkey-heroes possessing a terrific prowess."

Shlok 80: "O valiant demon! Since you look tired after performing your martial duty, I did not
kill you, with a fear of public censure. Identify my strength, after taking some rest."

Shlok 81: Kumbha was thus honoured with those insulting words of Sugreeva. Kumbha's splendour
then enhanced, like the splendour of the sacrificial fire, when a melted butter is offered to it as
an oblation."

Shlok 82- 83: The reopen, Kumbha pressingly clasped Sugreeva in his arms. Then, they stood
breathing heavily again and again as elephants in rut, having their bodies fastened against each
other, rubbing one another and emitting a flame to blaze with smoke from their faces because of
their fatigue.

Shlok 84: The battle-ground sank under the trampling of their feet. With their waves whirled
about, the ocean became turbulent.

Shlok 85: Then tossing up Kumbha, Sugreeva threw him down speedily into the ocean, showing him
the bottom of the sea.

Shlok 86: Due to the hurling down of Kumbha, the fully risen sea, reaching a height of as to
that of Mount Vindhya, diffused on all sides.

Shlok 87: The enraged Kumbha, then jumping up and throwing down Sugreeva, struck him on his
chest with his thunderbolt-like fist.

Shlok 88: Sugreeva's armour was burst asunder. Even blood appeared oozing out of his chest.
His cage of bones gave a counter-strike to that awfully forceful fist.

Shlok 89: Then, by the force of that fist shot forth there, a mighty flame resembling the fire
that bursts up on Mount Meru, was born out of a stroke of lightning.

Shlok 90: Thus struck by Kumbha there, that mighty Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, tightened
his fist which appeared like a thunderbolt.

Shlok 91: The valiant Sugreeva forcefully descended his fist, which shone like the solar disc
encircled by a thousand rays, on the breast of Kumbha.

Shlok 92: That Kumbha, very much hurt by that blow, was exhausted and then fell down, like
fire whose flame has extinguished.

Shlok 93: Thus struck with Sugreeva's fist, that demon fell down suddenly, as the planet Mars,
of splendid rays, would drop down from the sky accidentally.

Shlok 94: When Kumbha was killed in battle by Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, possessing a
terrific prowess, the earth with its mountains and forests trembled. Too much fear seized the
demons.



SARGA 77
------------------------------

[Text] Seeing Kumbha his brother killed in battle, the enraged Nikumbha with an iron club as 
his weapon roars and faces the battle. Hanuma directly attacks Nikumbha, by striking his fist forcibly 
on Nikumbha's breast. Unmoved by that blow, Nikumbha lifts Hanuma, off the ground. Hanuma in retaliation 
frees himself and throws down Nikumbha on the ground. Hanuma descends on Nikumbha, pounds his chest 
with his fist, catches his head and tears it off. Thus, Nikumbha dies at the hands of Hanuma.

Shlok 1: Seeing his brother stretched on the ground, Nikumbha cast angry looks at Sugreeva, as 
it would burn him into ashes.

Shlok 2: Then, Nikumbha of firm mind grasped his iron club, stupendous like the crest of Mount 
Mandara and which was bright, festooned with wreaths and provided with iron plates, measuring five digits 
in breadth.

Shlok 3: Round it ran a broad strip of gold while diamonds and rubies studded it all over. Like 
the death-dealing rod of Yama, it seemed causing dismay to the monkeys and nerving the demons with courage.

Shlok 4: Wielding that weapon, which in size resembled the flag-staff of Indra, Nikumbha of terrific 
prowess, roared with his mouth yawing wide.

Shlok 5- 6: On his chest shone a medal of gold. His arms were held by beautiful bracelets. Lustrous 
pendants depended from his ear. Resplendent garland enfolded his neck. With these ornaments and with 
his club, Nikumbha assumed the threatening semblance of a cloud, with lightning and thunder and shot 
with a vivid rainbow.

Shlok 7: The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like 
splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma.

Shlok 8: The sky above appeared whirled around in the toss of Nikumbha's club, as though Alaka 
the City with the palaces of Gandharvas performed rapid revolutions and the moon and the stars and the 
planets joining the rotating race.

Shlok 9: The hot tempered fire of Nikumbha, which had his club and ornaments for its flame and 
his fury as its fuel, became dangerous to be approached, like the fire rising at the time of dissolution 
of the world.

Shlok 10: The demons and the monkeys too, out of fear, were unable even to make the slightest movement. 
The mighty Hanuma, on his part, stood alone among them, with his breast bared to the fury of the attack, 
in front of Nikumbha.

Shlok 11: The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like 
splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma.

Shlok 12: The titanic club, which fell on the wide and rock-like chest of Hanuma, at once shattered 
into hundreds of fragments, like hundreds of meteors shattering into the sky.

Shlok 13: That Hanuma, struck by that blow of the club, was unmoved like a mountain in an earthquake.

Shlok 14: Thus struck by him, the mighty Hanuma the monkey-chief clenched his fist forcibly.

Shlok 15: The greatly splendoured, powerful and swift Hanuma, with the violence of the wind-god, 
his father, lifting that fist, struck it against, Nikumbha's breast with force.

Shlok 16: By the blow of that fist there, his armour got split up and red blood profusely oozed 
out, as a black cloud streaked suddenly with fierce lightning.

Shlok 17: But, by that blow, Nikumbha was unmoved, recovered soon and grasped the unwieldy bulk 
of Hanuma.

Shlok 18: Seeing the mighty Hanuma lifted off the ground in battle, loud roar of exultant joy rose 
from the ranks of demons.

Shlok 19: Eventhough he was being carried off in that way by that demon, Hanuma the son of wind-god, 
struck him with his thunderbolt-like fist.

Shlok 20: Freeing himself from Nikumbha, Hanuma the son of wind-god then threw him down on the 
ground and treated him with blows.

Shlok 21: Throwing down Nikumbha by main force and with a supreme effort, Hanuma descended on him, 
leaped on his chest and pounded it mercilessly.

Shlok 22: Then with both hands, he caught the enemy's neck, twisted it about and tore off his huge 
head, while Nikumbha was horribly roaring.

Shlok 23: Then, while the roaring Nikumbha was killed in battle by Hanuma, there ensued an exceedingly 
terrific struggle between the enraged Rama and Makaraksha, son of Khara, a ruler of demons.

Shlok 24: When it was clear that Nikumbha had expired, the monkeys shouted with glee, the quarters 
thundered with satisfaction, the earth rocked with joy, the heaven appeared to crumble and fear seized 
the army of demons.



SARGA 78
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana orders Makaraksha to proceed to the battle-field with an army and to kill
Rama, Lakshmana and the monkeys. Makaraksha, surrounded by his army of demons, set out for the
encounter. Makaraksha's whip and flag staff fall down all of a sudden, by the will of providence
and a dust-storm ensued. Ignoring those portents, Makaraskha's army march forward in the
battle-field, to reach Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 1: On hearing of Nikumbha and Kumbha having been killed, Ravana was very much flared up
like fire.

Shlok 2: Engulfed with both anger and sorrow, Ravana ordered the wide-eyed Makaraksha, the
son of Khara (as follows):

Shlok 3: "I am commanding you! Accompanied by an army, go my son! Kill Rama, Lakshmana and
the monkeys."

Shlok 4: Hearing Ravana's words, Makaraksha, the son of Khara, thinking himself as a hero,
was rejoiced and assured Ravana that he would do it certainly as commanded.

Shlok 5: Having respectfully saluted, even by performing circumambulation, the mighty
Makaraksha, by the orders of Ravana, came forth from these shining palace of Ravana.

Shlok 6: Makaraksha the son of Khara asked the commander of an army who was in the vicinity
to bring a chariot and the army swiftly.

Shlok 7: Hearing his words, the army-commander of the demons brought the chariot and the army
to his proximity.

Shlok 8: Walking clockwise round the chariot and ascending it, Makaraksha asked the
charioteer to drive forward the chariot quickly to the battle-field.



Then Makaraksha spoke the following words to those demons, "O demons! All of you
begin your fight before my presence."

Shlok 10: "The mighty Ravana, the king of demons commanded me to kill both Rama and Lakshmana
in battle."

Shlok 11: "Today, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva the monkey and the other monkeys with
my excellent arrows, O demons!"

Shlok 12: "By hurling the spears, I will destroy completely the huge army of monkeys who
arrived today to the battle-field, as the fire destroys the dry wood."

Shlok 13: Hearing those words of Makaraksha, all those strong demons, wielding various kinds
of weapons, were steadfast to fight.

Shlok 14- 15: Those cruel demons, who can change their forms at will, who had protruding tusks,
had tawny coloured eyes, had their disheveled hair, creating terror with their colossal bodies,
then marched forward like roaring elephants, shaking the firmament and surrounded the huge-bodied
Makaraksha.

Shlok 16: There arose a great tumult sounded, on all sides, of thousands of couches and
kettle-drums including leonine roars and clapping of arms.

Shlok 17: The long whip then slipped down from the hands of Makaraksha's charioteer and the
flag-staff of that demon also suddenly fell down by the will of the province.

Shlok 18: Those horses, yoked to his chariot, deprived of their diversified gait, were walking
with flurried feet and went timidly, with tears in their eyes.

Shlok 19: At the time of marching of that dreadful and evil-minded Makaraksha, a harsh and
fearful dust-storm blew forth.

Shlok 20: Though seeing those portents, all those highly valiant demons ignored them and set
out to the place, where both Rama and Lakshmana were there.

Shlok 21: Saying thunderously, "I shall take the lead", those demons who resembled black
clouds, elephants and buffaloes in hue, who had been wounded pointedly more than once by maces and
swords in the battle-front and who were skilled in martial art, moved hither and thither in the
battle-field.



SARGA 79
------------------------------

[Text] Fight again ensues between monkeys and demons, when Makaraksha enters the
battle-field. The monkeys get frightened of Makaraksha's arrows and begin to run away. Rama comes
in and intercepts the demons with his hail of arrows. Makaraksha challenges Rama to fight with him.
Rama tears off the arrows hurled by Makaraksha and Makaraksha broke the arrows released by Rama.
Finally, Rama breaks the chariot and its horses of his chariot, stands on the ground, takes a
splendorous spike in his hand to fight and hurls it on Rama. Rama chops it off with his four
arrows. When Makaraksha rushes towards Rama to fight with his fist, Rama hurls a mystic missile
from his bow and kills him on the spot. The demons get frightened and run away to Lanaka.

Shlok 1: On seeing Markaraksha come out, all those chiefs of monkeys, leaping all at once,
took their positions, with intent to give fight.

Shlok 2: Thereafter, a very great battle ensued between monkeys and demons, which caused
one's hair to bristle, like the encounter between celestials and demons.

Shlok 3: The monkeys and demons then, by hurling trees and spikes and by throwing maces and
clubs, began to crush each other.

Shlok 4- 5: Those demons, who were prowlers of might, made a slaughter of the lions among the
monkeys, by means of their javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, sharp edged spears, Bhindipalas
(slings for throwing stones), nooses, mallets, staffs, missiles and other weapons and by throwing
arrows on all sides.

Shlok 6: Tormented by Makaraksha with a multitude of arrows, all the monkeys were bewildered
in mind, agonized with fear and ran away.

Shlok 7: On seeing those monkeys fleeing, all the arrogant demons roared like lions, assuming
a triumphant feeling.

Shlok 8: While those monkeys were fleeing on all sides, Rama then, with a shower of arrows,
intercepted those demons on that occasion.

Shlok 9: Seeing Rama thus interrupting the demons, Makaraksha, the demon, engrossed in a fire
of anger, spoke the following words:

Shlok 10: "Pause, O Rama! You will have a dual with me. I will make your life to quit, by the
sharp arrows discharged from my bow."

Shlok 11: "Since you killed my father on that day in Dandaka forest, my anger is still growing
violent, when I think of you engaged in such nefarious acts".

Shlok 12: "O evil minded Rama! Since you were not being seen by me from that time in that
large forest, my limbs were getting very much fumed."

Shlok 13: "By a good fortune, you came into my sight here, O Rama! You are being sought by me,
as a lion in hunger seeks other animal to eat."

Shlok 14: "Now, by the flight of my arrows, you will go to the world of Death and reside there
with those warriors, who were killed by you earlier."

Shlok 15: "O Rama! What is the use, by telling too much on this topic? Hear my words. All the
worlds will look at you and me, in this battle-front."

Shlok 16: "O Rama! The battle will proceed in the battle-field, either with the weapons, or
with a mace or by our arms or by any other means as learnt by you."

Shlok 17: Hearing the words of Makaraksha, Rama the son of Dasaratha laughingly spoke the
following words to him, who was still talking further and further (without interruption).

Shlok 18: "O demon! Why are you boasting yourself with so many unworthy words, in vain?
Without fighting in the battle-field, it is well nigh impossible for you to attain victory with the
strength of a mere speech."

Shlok 19: "I killed fourteen thousand demons along with Khara your father, Trishira and even
Dushana in Dandaka forest."

Shlok 20: "O sinful one! Today, vultures jackals and crows with their sharp beaks and
goad-like claws will be satiated with your flesh."

Shlok 21: Hearing Rama's words, the mighty Makaraksha discharged a multitude of arrows on that
Rama in the battle-field.

Shlok 22: Rama tore those arrows in many ways, by his array of arrows. Those arrows, which
were provided with golden shafts, fell to the ground, when torn in thousands.

Shlok 23: That battle raged furiously, on their meeting each other there, between Makaraksha
the son of Khara the demon and Rama the son of Dasaratha.

Shlok 24: Then, the sound emanated by the bows, with a great resonance, was heard on the
battle-front, like the rumbling of clouds in space.

Shlok 25: With an intent to see that wonderful battle, all the celestials, the demons, the
celestial musicians kinnaras the mythical beings and Mahoragas the great serpents reached the
sky.

Shlok 26: Though the limbs of both were pierced by each other, their strength was redoubled.
The two warriors inflicted wounds on each other, returned the blows of the other in the
battle-front and continued the combat.

Shlok 27: In the battle, that demon broke the multitude of arrows discharged by Rama. Rama
snapped off, in many ways, the arrows released by the demon.

Shlok 28: All the four quarters and the intermediate points were diffused with a multitude of
arrows. Even the earth was covered on all sides and did not become visible.

Shlok 29: Then, the long-armed Rama, full of anger in battle, broke off the bow of the demon.
Thereupon, by his eight iron arrows, struck the charioteer.

Shlok 30: Rama, breaking the chariot with his arrows and killing its horses, made them to fall
down dead. That Makaraksha the demon, bereft of his chariot, stood on the ground.

Shlok 31: That demon, standing on the ground, took into his hand, a spike, which created
fright among all living beings and whose splendour was equal to the fire at the end of the
world.

Shlok 32: That great spike, which was difficult to be obtained, was gifted to him by Rudra,
one of the eight forms of Shiva the Lord of Dissolution. That terrible spike, which flamed
violently in the sky, looked like another new weapon of destruction of the world. On seeing it, all
the godheads were afflicted with fear and fled to different quarters.

Shlok 33: Brandishing that flaming great spike, that enraged demon hurled it against that
great-souled rama.

Shlok 34: Rama broke, by his four arrows, that flaming spike coming forth from Makaraksha's
arm and rushing towards him in the sky.

Shlok 35: That spike, adored with charming gold, broken in many ways, struck by Rama's arrows,
fell scattered on the earth, like a mighty meteor.

Shlok 36: Seeing that spike struck by Rama, who was unwearied in action, the beings standing
in the air, cried, saying 'Excellent, Excellent!'.

Shlok 37: Seeing that spike destroyed, Makaraksha the demon, rising his fist, called out to
Rama, saying "Wait, Wait!".

Shlok 38: Then, seeing Makaraksha rushing towards him, that Rama the delight of Raghu dynasty,
while smiling, fitted to his bow, a mystic missile presided over by fire.

Shlok 39: Struck by that missile by Rama, the demon with his heart split open, fell down dead
then and there, in the battle-field.

Shlok 40: Seeing the fall of Makaraksha, all those demons, tormented by the fear of Rama's
arrows, ran away straight to Lanka.

Shlok 41: Thrilled with delight, the celestials watched that demon, the son of Khara,
destroyed by the flights of Rama's arrows and resembling a mountain shattered, after struck by
lightning.



SARGA 80

[Text] Ravana instructs Indrajit to proceed to the battle field. Before proceeding t the
battle, Indrajit performs ceremorial oblations into a sacred fire and obtains a capacity of going
out of sight while fighting. He proceeds to the battle-field and releases a flood of arrows towards
Rama and Lakshmana, while himself remaining invisible in the sky. With a network of arrows,
Indrajit creates a darkness in the sky and showers a multitude of steel arrows towards Rama and
Lakshmana. Sharp golden shafts arrows are then released by Rama and Lakshmana. Struck by the arrows
discharged by Indrajit, monkeys in hundreds fall down dead. Then, Rama and Lakshmana reflect on the
various ways and means to destroy Indrajit.

Shlok 1- 2: On hearing Makaraksha having been killed, Ravana who had been ever victorious in
battle, grinding his teeth in rage, reflected on what to do then and there, and as greatly furious
as he was, instructed Indrajit, his son to proceed to the battle-field.

Shlok 3: "O hero! Either remaining yourself invisible or visible, kill Rama and Lakshmana,
the brothers of great prowess. You are superior in strength by all means."

Shlok 4: "You have conquered Indra, of incomparable deeds, in battle. Can you not kill those
two men, on seeing them in the battle-field?"

Shlok 5: Hearing the words of Ravana, that Indrajit, bowing to the command of his father,
poured oblations into the sacred fire, with due ceremony, on the sacrificial ground.

Shlok 6: Even as he was pouring oblations into the sacred fire there, the female-demons
carrying red turbans (for the use of priests) hastily arrived at the spot where Indrajit was
there.

Shlok 7: Weapons (such as a lance) served as blades of Shara grass (for being spread around
the sacrificial fire). Chips of wood of Vibhitaka tree served as wooden sticks to feed the
sacrificial fire as also red robes and iron ladles were used for cleaning and pouring clarified
melted butter into the sacrificial fire.

Shlok 8: Having spread on the ground around all the sides of the sacrificial fire with other
weapons along with lances, the demon seized hold of the neck of a live goat, entirely black and
consigned it to the fire.

Shlok 9: Such omens as betokened victory appeared in the smokeless fire which burst into
mighty flames, when it was fully aroused by that single offering.

Shlok 10: Becoming visible in person, the god of fire, who was shooting out flames towards the
right and who shone brightly like refined gold, received that offering.

Shlok 11: Offering oblations in fire and gratifying the gods, the devils and demons, Indrajit
ascended an excellent and splendid chariot, capable of disappearing from sight.

Shlok 12: Drawn by four horses, provided with sharp arrows and a mighty bow placed on it, that
excellent chariot looked beautiful.

Shlok 13: Adorned with gold, that chariot glittered on account of its body and was decorated
with carved images of antelopes, full moons and crescents.

Shlok 14: The flag-post of Indrajit shone like a flaming fire, provided, as it was, with large
rings of gold and decorated with cat's eye gems.

Shlok 15: Protected by the missile presided over by Brahma, which was as efflugent as the sun,
that Indrajit endowed with exceptional strength, became difficult to be attacked.

Shlok 16: Coming forth from the city and having acquired the capacity of vanishing from the
sight, by offering oblations into the sacred fire, with the uttereance of spells sacred to demons,
that indrajit, who was ever victorious in war, spoke as follows:

Shlok 17: "By killing both the princes who left home to become religious mendicants in the
forest in vain, I will present a gift of victory secured in the battle, to my father, Ravana
today."

Shlok 18: "By making the earth bereft of monkeys today and by killing Rama and Lakshmana, I
will create a great spleasure". Thus speaking, Indrajit vanished from thes sight.

Shlok 19: Impelled, as he was, by Ravana, the fiery Indrajit, with his barbarons bow and steel
arrows, swiftly came to the battle-field enraged.

Shlok 20: That Indrajit saw the two heroes, showering a multitude of arrows. Both the princes,
having mighty prowess, looked like three- hooded serpents in the middle of the monkeys.

Shlok 21: Concluding that both of them were the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana and stringing
his bow, he covered them with a flood of arrows, as the rainy clouds do.

Shlok 22: That Indrajit with his chariot, reaching the sky and remaining invisible, struck
Rama and Lakshmana with his sharp arrows.

Shlok 23: When enveloped by a stream of arrows Rama and Lakshamana, fitted arrows to their
bows and revealed divine missiles.

Shlok 24: Though covering the sky with a net-work of arrows, the two mighty princes could not
touch Indrajit with their arrows charged with mystic missiles and which were efflugent like the
sun.

Shlok 25: Covering the sky, the illustrious Indrajit created a dark-like smoke. He made the
quarters also invisible, by enclosing them with mist-liek darkness.

Shlok 26: While Indrajit was moving about, neither the sound produced by the impact of his
palm on the bow string was heard, nor the sound of his wheels or the clattering of hoofs of his
horses could be heard, nor did his form come tot he view.

Shlok 27: In that thick darkness, that long-armed Indrajit showered hails of his steel arrows,
like wonderful shower of rocks.

Shlok 28: That enraged Indrajit in battle, abundantly pierced Rama in all his limbs with his
arrows, which were earlier granted as boons to him and which were effluent like the sun.

Shlok 29: Both Rama and Lakshmana, the foremost of men, who were being struck with steel
arrows, like two mountains being hit by torrents, released sharp golden-shafted arrows.

Shlok 30: Those arrows, adorned with plumes of heron, reaching Indrajit in the sky and
piercing him, fell to the ground, soaked in blood.

Shlok 31: Shining beyond measure with a flood of arrows, the two excellent men began to chop
off those arrows which were falling on them with many arrows called by the name of Bhallas.

Shlok 32: Both Rama and Lakshmana for their part directed their excellent missiles in the
direction from which they saw the aforesaid sharp arrows, fallen.

Shlok 33: Indrajit for his part, who was a superior chariot-warrior and who was swift in
discharging missiles, rushed on towards all sides and pierced Rama and Lakshmana with his sharp
arrows.

Shlok 34: Those valiant princes, Rama and Lakshmana pierced deeply with well-made goldne
shafted arrows, appeared like two Kamshuka trees in flowering.

Shlok 35: No one could perceive his rapid movement, like the position of the sun when the sky
is thickly overcast with clouds, nor his form nor his bows and arrows, nor any other thing about
him whatsoever could be known.

Shlok 36: Struck down by him, the monkeys were killed. The monkeys dropped dead in hundreds on
the earth's surface there.

Shlok 37: Then, Lakshmana for his part was enraged and told his brother that he would employ
the missile presided over by Brahma for the purpose of killing all the demons.

Shlok 38: Then, Rama spoke to that Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks as
follows: "You ought not to kill all the demons on earth, merely for the sake of a single
demon."

Shlok 39: "You ought not to kill on this earth one who is not fighting or one who is hiding or
one who seeks refuge with joined palms or is fleeing or is intoxicated."

Shlok 40: "O long-armed Lakshmana! We shall try to kill Indrajit alone. We will employ mystic
mssiles with great impetuosity and which are equal to venomous serpents."

Shlok 41: "On seeing this demons, the leaders of mokey-troops will forcibly kill this petty
demon, who is skilled in conjuring tricks and whose chariot remains invisible."

Shlok 42: "Scorched by my mystic missiles, he will fall dead on the ground, even if he enters
the earth or into heaven or into the subterrranean world or penetrates the vault of heaven and
remains completely hidden in this manner."

Shlok 43: Speaking highly meaningful words in the aforesaid manner, the great-souled Rama,
surrounded by the foremost of monkeys, started to reflect on the speedy means of killing the
furious Indrajit, the demons of cruel deeds.



SARGA 81
------------------------------

[Text] Placing an illusory live image of Seetha in his chariot, Indrajit along with his
army enters the battle-field. Hanuma with his army of monkeys march in front to face Indrajit in
battle. While Hanuma and his army are watching, Indrajit pulls Seetha by her hair and unsheathed
his sword. Indrajit kills the illusory living image of Seetha, with his sharp sword.

Shlok 1: Guessing the mind of that great-souled Rama, Indrajit turning away from that battle,
entered the City.

Shlok 2: Then, recalling the killing of those energetic demons like Kumbhakarna and others,
that valiant Indrajit sallied forth (for the fight) with red-hot eyes in anger.

Shlok 3: That Indrajit, of very great prowess, the adversary of gods and who was born in Sage
Pulstya's dynasty, accompanied by an army of demons, came forth from the western gate.

Shlok 4: Seeing the two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshamana, who were prepared for the
encounter, Indrajit for his part, then started to demonstrate his conjuring tricks.

Shlok 5: Placing an illusory image of Seetha on his chariot and a large army surrounding the
chariot, Indrajit intended to kill her.

Shlok 6: Making up his mind to purposefully confuse all, by playing a trick to kill Seetha's
illusory image, the exceedingly evil-minded Indrajit sallied forth towards the direction of the
monkeys.

Shlok 7: Seeing him coming forth towards their direction, all those monkeys were enraged and
bounced towards him, with rocks in their hands and with an intent to fight.

Shlok 8: Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, taking hold of a very large mountain-peak,
which was difficult to be reached by others, marched in front.

Shlok 9: That Hanuma saw Seetha, the wife of Rama, the best among women, bereft of joy,
wearing only a single braid of hair, looking miserable, with her face emaciated due to fasting,
dressed in a single worn-out clothing, unadorned and with all her limbs covered with dust and dirt;
in the chaiot of Indrajit.

Shlok 11: On seeing her for a moment, Hanuma ascertained her as Seetha and became dejected.
That Seetha was indeed seen by him, not long ago.

Shlok 12- 13: Seeing her stricken with grief bereft of joy, looking distreseed, miserable and
sitting under the sway of Indrajit, Hanuma wondered as to what his intention might be. Thus
thinking, he along with those leaders of mnkeys, rushed towards Indrajit.

Shlok 14: Beholding that army of monkeys, Indrajit was excited with anger, pulled Seetha by
the hair on her head and unsheathed his sword.

Shlok 15: While those monkeys were seeing, demon began to strike that woman who was placed in
the chariot by the dint of his conjuring trick and who was crying "Rama! Rama!"

Shlok 16: On seeing her seized by the hair Hanuma the son of wind-god was confounded with
affliction and shed tears, in agony from his eyes.

Shlok 17: On seeing Seetha with all her charming limbs, the beloved wife of Rama, Hanuma
angrily addressed the foolowing harsh words to Indrajit:

Shlok 18: "O evil minded one! Born in a dynasty of Brahmanical sages, but belonging to
demoniacal race, you touched a lock of her hair, for your hair, for your own ruin."

Shlok 19: "O cruel, vulgar and mean fellow! O wicked demon of sinful prowess! O pitiless
fellow! Woe be to you, of sinful conduct, in whom such a resolve has taken place. Such an act is
worthy of a barbarian. There is no pity in you."

Shlok 20: "O pitiless one! Seetha came away from her house, from her kingdom and from her
huband's (Rama's) protection. What wrong has Seetha done to you, that you are killing her?"

Shlok 21: "By killing Seetha, you will not survivie for long in any way. O demon, desrving of
death! By your act, you indeed fell into my hands."

Shlok 22: "Abandoning your life in this world, you shall, after death, descend to those worlds
which are the lot of the killers of women and are condemned even by those who deserved to be killed
by the people."

Shlok 23: Thus speaking, Hanuma surrounded as he was by monkeys with their weapons and very
much enraged, rushed headlong towards Indrajit.

Shlok 24: The army of demons of terrible rage intercepted that army of mokeys possessing a
high prowess and advancing towards them.

Shlok 25: Stirring up that army of mokeys with a multitude of his arrows, Indrajit replied to
Hanuma, the foremost of mokeys as follows:

Shlok 26: "For whose sake, Sugreeva, yourself and Rama came here, I am going to kill Seetha
now itself, while you stand looking on."

Shlok 27: "O monkey! After killing her, I will make a short work of Rama, Lakshmana, yourself
too, Sugreeva and that vulgar Vibhishana thereafter."

Shlok 28: "O monkey! What you have said just now viz. that women are not to be killed, is
correct. But that which causes tormentation to the enemies indeed needs to be done."

Shlok 29: Having spoken thus to Hanuma, Indrajit personally killed that illusory Seetha, who
ahd been sobbing all the while, with his sharp-edged sword.

Shlok 30: Split asunder by him diagonally, that miserable lady of broad hips and pleasant to
the sight, fell down on the ground.

Shlok 31- 32: After killing that woman, Indrajit told Hanuma as follows: "See, I killed Rama's
wife with my weapon. This Seetha is dead and all your labour is in vain."

Shlok 33: After killing her with a large sword personally, that Indrajit then sitting on his
chariot, pleasurefully roared loudly.

Shlok 34: The monkeys standing in vicinity heard his roar, even as he shouted with his mouth
wide open, while comfortable sitting in that tower of the aerial chriot, which was actually
difficult of access for others.

Shlok 35: After killing Seetha in that way, the evil-minded Indrajit became exceedingly glad.
Seeing him exceedingly pleased, the monkeys looked dejected and suddenly ran away.



SARGA 82
------------------------------

[Text] Led by Hanuma, the monkeys fight with the demons in battle with trees and rocks. On
seeing his army seriously hurt, Indrajit releases a number of arrows and kills some monkeys. Hanuma
destroys some terrible demons with trees and rocks. Later, Hanuma along with his army returns to
the presence of Rama. Indrajit pours oblations into the sacred fire at the santuary of
Nikumbhila.

Shlok 1: Hearing that terrific roar, similar to the sound of Indra's thunderbolt, the monkeys
looking hither and thither, ran away in all directions.

Shlok 2: Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke (as follows) to all those monkeys, who were
running away widely apart, looking dejected, miserable and frightened.

Shlok 3: "O, monkeys! Why are you running away, looking dejected and leaving your zeal to
fight? Where has your valour gone?"

Shlok 4: "Come along closely behind me, while I am marching ahead in the battle. For the
valiant who are born in a good family, it is not indeed proper to shrink back from the battle."

Shlok 5: Hearing the words of that wise Hanuma, the monkeys in a cheerful mood, took hold of
mountain-peaks and trees in a great fury.

Shlok 6: The foremost of monkeys, while roaring, rushed towards the demons. They followed
him, by surrounding Hanuma on all sides, in that great battle.

Shlok 7: That Hanuma, being surrounded by those monkey-chiefs on all sides, began to consume
that army of adversaries as a flaming fire.

Shlok 8: That Hanuma, accompanied by his army of monkeys, brought about the destruction of
demons, as Yama the lord of death does at the time of universal dissolution.

Shlok 9: Filled with inordinate grief and rage, that Hanuma the monkey-chief, threw a large
rock on Indrajit's chariot.

Shlok 10: On seeing that rock rushing towards them, the obedient horses, yoked to that
chariot, carried the chariot off to a far-distance.

Shlok 11: That rock employed in vain, without reaching that Indrajit and his charioteer
sitting in the chariot, split itself into fragments and penetrated the ground.

Shlok 12: The demons were very much bruised by the falling fragments of the rock. That army of
demons was perturbed over the rock thus falling upon them.

Shlok 13: Hundreds of monkeys with their colossal bodies, lifting up trees and mountain-peaks,
rushed roaring towards Indrajit.

Shlok 14: Those monkeys of terrible prowess, threw trees and mountain-peaks towards Indrajit
in battle. While shooting a large deluge of trees and rocks, the monkeys caused destruction of
their enemies. They roared in various high tones.

Shlok 15: Beaten forcibly with trees, by those highly terrible monkeys, those demons of
frightful appearance, rolled about restlessly in the battle-field.

Shlok 16: On seeing his army tormented by the monkeys, that enraged Indrajit, taking hold of
his weapons, sallied forth, facing towards his enemies.

Shlok 17: That Indrajit, of firm fortitude, accompanied by his army, by releasing a multitude
of arrows, killed a very many number of monkeys.

Shlok 18: In the battle, Indrajit's soldiers too killed the monkeys with spikes tips of
missiles, swords, sharp-edged spears and concealed weapons similar to mallets.

Shlok 19: The mighty Hanuma played a havoc among demons of terrible deeds, with Shala trees,
distinguished by excellent trunks and branches as with rocks.

Shlok 20: Keeping the hostile army back, that Hanuma spoke to those monkeys as follows:
"Retreat! This army need not be conquered any more by us."

Shlok 21: "That Seetha for whose sake we have fought so far, with a wish to do what is
pleasing to Rama, making a special effort to win, risking our lives has been killed."

Shlok 22: "Informing Rama and even Sugreeva about this matter, we shall do that which both of
them are prepared to do in return."

Shlok 23: Thus speaking and keeping back all the monkeys, Hanuma the chief of monkeys, with
absence of fear, along with his army, gradually turned back.

Shlok 24: Seeing Hanuma with drawing to the place where Rama was, the evil-minded Indrajit
went to a sanctuary called Nikumbhila, seeking to pour oblations into the sacred fire.

Shlok 25- 26: Arriving at Nikumbhila, Indrajit poured oblations into the sacred fire. Thereupon,
while being propitiated by that demon on reaching sacrificial ground, the sacrificial fire then
blazed up on consuming the oblations of flesh and blood.

Shlok 27: Swollen up when propitiated with oblations of blood, the highly intense fire, like
the evening sun, appeared wrapped in flames.

Shlok 28: Then, Indrajit, well-versed with the technique of performance of rites for the
prosperity of the demons, poured oblations according to the scriptural precepts. Seeing this, those
demons, who knew what was prudent and evil in major battles, stood firm in big piles (by Indrajit's
side).



SARGA 83
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma, with his army, approaches Rama and informs him that Indrajit has killed
Seetha. Rama faints away, upon hearing that news. The monkeys sprinkle water on Rama, so that he
regains consciousness. Then, Lakshmana embraces Rama and discusses with him the roles of vice and
virtue in life. After consoling Rama, Lakshmana prepares for a fight with Indrajit.

Shlok 1: On hearing that great tumult of battle between demons and monkeys, Rama spoke to
Jambavan as follows:

Shlok 2: "O excellent Jambavan! From the way in which a very great terrible rattling sound of
arms in heard, it seems an exceedingly difficult feat has been performed by Hanuma. It is
certain."

Shlok 3: "O lord of bears! Therefore, accompanied by your own army, go and quickly extend
your help to that Hanuma, who is fighting."

Shlok 4: Saying "Yes, so be it" and surrounded by his own army, Jambavan came to the western
gate, where the monkey, Hanuma was.

Shlok 5: Thereupon, Jambavan saw Hanuma, coming with monkeys, who had given fight and were
sighing (on account of grief caused by the destruction of Seetha).

Shlok 6: Seeing that terrible army of bears, looking like a dark cloud on their way, ready
(to perform battle) and effectively intercepting it, Hanuma retreated them all.

Shlok 7: Quickly seeking the presence of Rama with that army, the highly illustrious Hanuma,
with sorrow, spoke the following words to Rama:

Shlok 8: "While we, who were carrying on the battle, stood looking on, Indrajit, the son of
Ravana killed Seetha in front of us, even though she continued to weep."

Shlok 9: "O destroyer of enemies! On seeing her with my distressed mind, I felt sad. I came
to report the event to you."

Shlok 10: Hearing those words of Hanuma, Rama then was agitated with grief and fell down on
the ground, like a tree with its bottom chopped off.

Shlok 11: On seeing that Rama, who with the semblance of god, falling on the ground, the
chiefs of monkeys came bouncing from all sides and rushed towards him.

Shlok 12: They sprinkled him with water, fragrant with scent of lotuses and lilies, as one
would sprinkle an inextinguishable as one would sprinkle an inextinguishable fire, which has just
flared up suddenly and is burning all.

Shlok 13: Then, the highly lamenting Lakshmana, having embraced that ailing Rama in his arms,
spoke the following meaningful words, endowed with reason:

Shlok 14: "O venerable brother! Virtue cannot save you, who are sticking to the noble path and
who have subdued the senses, from adversities and is (hence) useless."

Shlok 15: "Just as inanimate and animate beings are visible, likewise virtue and vice are not
visible. Therefore, my opinion is that virtue is non-existent."

Shlok 16: "Even as inanimate beings and animate beings are expressly visible, likewise this
form of virtue of vice is not established. For, in that case, a virtuous man like you would not
have this misfortune."

Shlok 17: "If unrighteousness had been effective, Ravana should have obtained the hell. You,
endowed with virtue, would never obtain such troubles."

Shlok 18: "Since there is absence of calamity for Ravana and misfortune occurred to you, the
result of vice is obtained through virtue and the result of virtue is obtained through vice. The
contraries of each other have changed the roles with each other."

Shlok 19- 20: Will the fruit of virtue be obtained through virtue and fruit of vice through vice?
If that in whom unrighteousness is rooted are enjoined with the fruit of unrighteousness alone,
people showing interest in unrighteousness would be deprived of the fruit of virtue. The fruit of
virtue alone would have accrued to those who administer righteousness through that virtue?

Shlok 21: Since prosperities of those, in whom unrighteousness is rooted, develop; while those
who have a conduct of virtue suffer, hence these two (virtue and vice) are useless.

Shlok 22: "O Rama! If sinful doers are killed by their own vice, that unrighteousness, as it
does, in the act of killing, will be forthwith destroyed. Whom will that unrighteousness destroy
(which is destroyed in the course of three seconds)?"

Shlok 23: "Or if a man is killed by a recourse to a ritual prescribed in the scriptures or
kills another (by recourse to such a ritual), that destiny alone, which is engendered by that
ritual, is tainted by that sinful act and not the agent."

Shlok 24: "O Rama, the destroyer of adversaries! It is not clear how prosperity can be reached
by righteousness, which has never known how to retaliate. Hence, righteousness seems to be
non-existent."

Shlok 25: "O chief among the virtuous! If righteousness were really there, no evil whatever
would have accrued to you. As you reaped such a calamity, the hypotheses that the destiny
engendered by virtuous acts is real is not proved."*

[Commentary] *The utterance of such apparently incoherent words on the part of Lakshmana in a
fit of agony on seeing Rama agonized shows his agitation caused by love. Later on, as his grief
subsides, Lakshmana himself says in verse 44 below that he had given expression only to assuage the
grief of Rama and spur him on to action.

Shlok 26: "Or else, if righteousness becomes weak and cowardly, as it surrenders to the might,
it is my opinion that the righteousness, which lacks strength and has been deprived of its
capacity, should no longer be pursued."

Shlok 27: "Depend on might, as you do now on virtue, if the virtue is subordinate to might,
thus giving up predominance of virtue."

Shlok 28: "O tormentator of enemies! Or else, if speaking truth were indeed a virtue, our
lying father, who was merciless to you, was disunited from you. Were you not bound by that
announcement made by our father regarding your installation as the Prince Regent?"

Shlok 29: "O tormentator of your enemies! Had either righteousness or unrighteousness worth
pursuing, Indra the wielder of thunderbolt would not have performed a sacrifice on killing a sage
(viz. Viswarupa, son of Twasta*)

[Commentary] *The story was narrated at length in Book VI, DiscourseIX of Srimad
Bhagavata.

Shlok 30: "O Rama! Virtue destroys enemies, when united with might (something other than
virtue). O Rama! A man does all this, according to his will."

Shlok 31: "O Rama in a pitiable condition. My opinion is that righteousness consists in such
recourse to both virtue and strength. The very roots of virtue (in the form of earthly gain) have
been chopped off by you in that you spurned the sovereignty the other day."

Shlok 32: "By the treasures brought from place to place and augmented by means of various
strategies, all the tasks are indeed fulfilled, as the rivers flow from the mountains."

Shlok 33: "All the tasks of a man of small intellect, bereft of his wealth, get a cessation as
small rivers dry up in summer-season."

Shlok 34: "Such a man, brought up by comforts, renouncing wealth (within easy reach) and
seeking comfort, proceeds to commit sinful act and then evil (in the form of punishment) follows
from it."

Shlok 35: "Friends gather round him, who has riches. Relatives stand by him, who has riches.
He alone is virile in the world, who has riches. He alone is a learned man, who has riches."

Shlok 36: "He alone is a mighty man, who has riches. He alone is a prudent man, who has
riches. He alone is highly fortunate. He alone is distinguished, who has riches."

Shlok 37: "O resolute one! I told you about these evils attendant on the abjuration of wealth.
The ground on which you made the resolve to sacrifice the kingdom was not known to me."

Shlok 38: "A man in whom the treasures abide, religious merit and wealth are obtained. All
would be favourable to him. To the penniless man, who has a desire for wealth and even hunting for
wealth, it is not possible to attain wealth."

Shlok 39: "O king! Delight, sensuous pleasure, pride, virtue, anger, peace, control of the
senses all these are attained from wealth."

Shlok 40: "Those riches, due to renunciation of which, worldly happiness of those practicing
the path of virtue gets lost, are not seen in you, any more than the planets are seen in cloudy
days."

Shlok 41: "O valiant one! While you were in exile, faithful to the command of your father,
your wife who was more beloved than life itself, was stolen away by a demon."

Shlok 42: "O valiant prince! I shall dispel with my exploits today, that great agony caused by
Indrajit. Therefore, rise O Rama!"

Shlok 43: "O the foremost among men! O the long-armed one! O the firmly resolute one! Arise!
Why are you not knowing about yourself, who is the great-souled and whose spirit is
disciplined?"

Shlok 44: "O faultless one! On seeing the death of Seetha and enraged, rising to do favour for
you, I shall completely destroy with my arrows, Lanka with its chariots, elephants and horses along
with Ravana."

[Text] Vibhishana comes to Lakshmana and beholds Rama having fallen into a swoon and lying
in the lap of Lakshmana. Lakshmana informs Vibhishana that on hearing the words of Hanuma saying
that Seetha was killed by Indrajit, Rama fell into a swoon. Telling Rama the secret of conjuring
trick practiced by Indrajit in killing an illusory image of Seetha, Vibhishana assures him of
Seetha being still alive and urges him to send Lakshmana with an army to the sanctuary of
Nikumbhila.

Shlok 1: While Lakshmana, who was so fond of his brother, was consoling Rama, Vibhishana,
keeping the troops of simian army in their respective positions, arrived there.

Shlok 2- 3: That Vibhishana, surrounded by four warriors, wielding many types of weapons, and
who were chiefs of troops, looking like heaps of black collyrium and who were appearing like
elephants, approached Lakshmana who was totally engrossed in sorrow and saw the monkeys also, whose
eyes were filled with tears.

Shlok 4: Vibhishana also saw the great-souled Rama, the delight of Inkshvaku dynasty fallen
into a swoon and resting on the lap of Lakshmana.

Shlok 5: On seeing the embarrassed Rama, tormented with grief, that Vibhishana, distressed as
he was in spirits, with agony inside, asked him, "What is this?"

Shlok 6: Fixing his gaze on Vibhishana's face and looking at Sugreeva and those monkeys,
Lakshmana with tears pouring down, spoke the following words, with a splendid meaning:

Shlok 7: "O gentle Sir! Just on hearing through the words of Hanuma, saying that Seetha was
killed by Indrajit, Rama entered into a swoon."

Shlok 8: Intercepting the narrating Lakshmana in the middle, Vibhishana spoke the following
amply meaningful words to Rama, who was in an unconscious state.

Shlok 9: "I hold that which you have been told by Hanuma with a sorrowful temper, O ruler of
men, to be absurd as the drying up of the sea."

Shlok 10: "O the long armed! I know the design of the evil-minded Ravana towards Seetha. He
would never do the killing of Seetha."

Shlok 11: "Eventhough begged by me, the well-wisher, several times to give up Seetha, he did
not heed that advice."

Shlok 12: "It is neither possible even to see her by recourse to conciliation nor by bestowing
gifts nor by sowing dissention. How is it possible then by a war? By any other strategy, it is
impossible."

Shlok 13: "That Indrajit for his part retracted, by hoodwinking the monkeys. O the long armed!
Know that Seetha (who was seemingly killed by him) as illusory."

Shlok 14: "After reaching a sanctuary by name Nikumbhila, this Indrajit will pour oblations
into the sacred fire. On returning after pouring oblations into the sacred fire, Indrajit will
prove difficult to be overcome in battle, even by celestials including Indra."

Shlok 15: "Certainly, this conjuring trick (in the form of killing an illusory living effigy
of Seetha) was exhibited by him, who was employing his magical art, expecting interruption by the
prowess of the monkeys there."

Shlok 16- 17: "While the sacrificial performance is not ended, we shall proceed to that place,
along with an army. O the foremost of men! Give up this improper grief, which has come upon you.
Seeing you tormented with grief, the entire army is sinking into despondency."

Shlok 18: "Very exalted as you are in courage, stay you here, confident at heart, and send
Lakshmana with us, who are taking an army along with us."

Shlok 19: "This Lakshmana, the eminent prince, can make Indrajit abandon that act of
sacrifice, by employing his sharp arrows. Then, he will be susceptible of being killed."

Shlok 20: "Lakshmana's arrows, which are sharp and fiery, with a speed equal to the wings of a
bird, can drink his blood like cruel birds."

Shlok 21: "O the long-armed one! Therefore, dispatch Lakshmana having auspicious body-marks
even as Indra the lord of celestials employed the thunderbolt to kill Indrajit."

Shlok 22: "O the best of men! It is not appropriate to delay the killing of the enemy any
further now. Therefore, grant permission to Lakshmana to destroy the enemy, as Indra would hurl his
thunderbolt to destroy the enemies of celestials."

Shlok 23: "If that Indrajit, the foremost of demons completes the sacrifice, he would not be
visible even to the celestials and the demons in battle. If he come with a desire to fight, after
ending that sacrifice, the celestials also will feel a great suspicion on their own lives."



SARGA 85
------------------------------

[Text] Vibhishana suggests Rama to send Lakshmana to kill Indrajit, even before Indrajit
completes the sacrificial fire in the sanctuary of Nikumbhila. Rama then asks Lakshmana to proceed
with the battle along with armies of Sugreeva, Hanuma, Jambavan and Vibhishana. Lakshmana proceeds
to Nikumbhila along with Hanuma, Vibhishana and Jambavan to kill Indrajit. Lakshmana accompanied by
Vibhishana, Angada and Hanuma penetrates that heterogeneous army of the enemies at the sanctuary of
Nikumbhila.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words of Vibhishana, Rama, agonized as he was with grief, could not
understand clearly what was spoken by that demon.

Shlok 2: Then, Rama the conqueror of the cities of enemies, leaning upon his courage, spoke
to Vibhishana who was sitting nearby and in front of the monkeys (as follows):

Shlok 3: "O lord of demons! I wish to hear again those of the words spoken by you. I desire
to hear again, whatever you intend to tell me."

Shlok 4: Hearing those words of Rama, spoken very sadly, that Vibhishana who was skilled in
expression, again spoke his words gently as follows:

Shlok 5: "O the long armed hero! Immediately after your orders, the marshalling of the troops
was done by me in the manner as enjoined by you."

Shlok 6: "All those armies were divided and positioned at all places. Even the commanders of
those divisions were arrayed and distributed according to their ranks."

Shlok 7: "O great lord! I have to report to you something further. Listen to it. While you
are lamenting without any cause, we feel painful at our hearts."

Shlok 8: "O king! Abandon this lamentation and false grief which came to you. Let your worry,
which augments the pleasure of your adversaries be therefore abandoned."

Shlok 9: "O hero! If you want to get back Seetha and if the demons are to be destroyed, raise
up for the occasion. Keep yourself cheerful."

Shlok 10- 11: "O Rama! Listen to my benign words I tell you. This Lakshmana together with a large
army should go soon to kill Indrajit, who reached Nikumbhila, with arrows as deadly as the
serpentine poison released from his snake-like bow in battle."

Shlok 12: "By his penance, Indrajit obtained a weapon called Brahmashira, by way of a gift
from Brahma and also horses, which are coursing at his will."

Shlok 13: "That Indrajit, as such along with his army, is reported to have reached Nikumbhila.
If he comes forth after completing his sacrificial act, know that all of us as killed."

Shlok 14- 15: "A boon was given by Brahma to that intelligent demon as follows: "O Indrajit! That
enemy of yours, who strikes while you are marching with your bow drawn, and while you have not
arrived at Nikumbhila, or even while you have not offered oblations to the sacred fire, will prove
to be the cause of your killing."

Shlok 16: "O mighty Rama! Give your command for killing of Indrajit. When he is killed, know
that Ravana along with his associate troops also as killed."

Shlok 17: Hearing the words of Indrajit, Rama then spoke the following words:"O Vibhishana of
true prowess! I know the conjuring trick of that terrific demon."

Shlok 18: "That Indrajit is skilled in the use of the mystic missile presided over by Brahma.
He is intelligent. He is a master of several conjuring tricks. He is so mighty that he can render
unconscious in battle even the gods along with Varuna the king of gods."

Shlok 19: "O highly illustrious hero! While he drifts in the sky, ascending his chariot, his
movement is not known to others, as the sun is not seen beneath a dense mass of clouds."

Shlok 20: Having known the toughness of the conjuring tricks of the evil-minded adversary,
Rama spoke to the illustrious Lakshmana as follows:

Shlok 21- 22: "O Lakshmana! You, accompanied by that entire army which stands at the disposal of
Sugreeva, along with troop-commanders with Hanuma as their head; and protected by Jambavan the lord
of bears, who will be accompanied by his army, kill that Indrajit the prince of demons, rich in the
power of conjuring tricks."

Shlok 23: "The great souled Vibhishana, who knows all the conjuring tricks of Indrajit, along
with his counsellors, will follow behind you."

Shlok 24: Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana of highly wonderful prowess, along with
Vibhishana, took hold of his excellent bow.

Shlok 25: The rejoiced Lakshmana who was prepared for the combat, clad in an armour, wielding
a sword and arrows, wearing his bow in his left hand and having touched Rama's feet in salutation,
spoke as follows:

Shlok 26: "Today, the arrows released from my bow, piercing Indrajit, will drop into the City
of Lanka, as swans descend into a louts-pond.

Shlok 27: "Now itself, my arrows discharged from the bow-string of this great bow, duly
splitting his terrific body, will blow him away."

Shlok 28: Thus speaking in front of his brother, that resplendent Lakshmana, quickly marched
forward, with an intent to kill Indrajit.

Shlok 29: Offering salutation to the feet of his brother and doing circumambulation too, that
Lakshmana went to the sanctuary named Nikumbhila, which was protected by Indrajit.

Shlok 30: Having obtained the blessings from his brother, the glorious Lakshmana, the prince,
quickly sallied forth along with Vibhishana.

Shlok 31: Then, Hanuma accompanied by many a thousand of monkeys and Vibhishana along with his
counsellors went behind Lakshmana.

Shlok 32: That Lakshmana, quickly surrounded by a large army of monkeys, saw the army of
Jambavan also stationed in the way.

Shlok 33: After covering a long distance, that Lakshmana, the delight to his friends, saw the
army of Ravana, ranged in battle-array, from a distance.

Shlok 34: Duly arriving at Nikumbhila, that foe-conquering Lakshmana stood, bow in hand, to
conquer that Indrajit, the possessor of conjuring tricks, in conformity with Brahma's
ordinance.

Shlok 35: The valiant Lakshmana stood there along with Vibhishana, the heroic Angada and
Hanuma, the son of wind-god.

Shlok 36: Lakshmana penetrated that heterogeneous army of enemies, resplendent with spotless
weapons, thick with ensigns and abounded with huge chariots, exceedingly impenetrable, very
terrific, with unimaginable swiftness, even as one would enter a thick veil of darkness.



SARGA 86
------------------------------

[Text] On the advice of Vibhishana, Lakshmana releases a multiple of arrows towards
Indrajit. A fight ensues between bears monkeys and demons. Hearing the terrible noise of the
battle, Indrajit discontinues his sacrificial rite and enters the battle-field. Hanuma with trees
as weapons, plays havoc among the demons and challenges Indrajit to a duel. Lakshmana catches sight
of Indrajit, coming in his chariot.

Shlok 1: In that situation, Vibhishana then spoke the following words, which were hostile to
the enemies and advantageous to Lakshmana.

Shlok 2: "Let this army of demons which is seen here, dark as a cloud, be quickly engaged in
battle, by the monkeys using rocks as thier weapons."

Shlok 3: "O Lakshmana! Make an effort to break this mighty army. When this army is destroyed,
Indrajit also will become visible."

Shlok 4: "You as such, rush forward quickly, gushing out arrows, equal to Indra's
thunderbolt, on the enemies, so long as this sacrificial act of Indrajit is not actually carried
through."

Shlok 5: "O hero! Make a short work of Indrajit, the evil minded, who is interested in
performing conjuring tricks, who is unjust, engaged in cruel acts and who brings fear to all the
worlds."

Shlok 6: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, showered forth
streams of arrows in the direction of Indrajit.

Shlok 7: Bears and monkeys, who fight was gigantic trees, rushed towards that army of demons,
drawn up in battle-array.

Shlok 8: The demons too, with an intent to kill the monkeys in battle, attacked them with
sharp arrows, sowrds, spears and javelins.

Shlok 9: That tumultuous battle between the monkeys and the demons rendered Lanka noisy on
all sides with its great uproar.

Shlok 10: The sky was covered with weapons of various shapes, sharp arrows, trees and tossed
mountain tops.

Shlok 11: Those demons of ugly faces and arms, hurling weapons on the monkeys, created a great
fear.

Shlok 12: Even the monkeys too struck and killed all the demons in the battle, with various
types of trees and mountain-peaks.

Shlok 13: A great fear developed among the demons who were fighting with mighty leaders of
bears and monkeys endowed with colossal bodies.

Shlok 14: Hearing that his own army being tormented by the enemies, was dejected; that
unconquerable Indrajit left off, without performing the sacrificial rite.

Shlok 15: That enraged Indrajit, coming out from the gloominess of the trees, ascended his
firmly yoked chariot which had already been united

Shlok 16: That awful Indrajit, armed with terrific bow and arrows, looking like a mass of
black collyrium with his blood-red eyes, appeared like the destructive Death.

Shlok 17: Just on seeing Indrajit being on a chariot, that army of demons with a terrific
speed, turned back, wishing to fight with Lakshmana.

Shlok 18- 19: At that time, Hanuma the destroyer of enemies looking like a mountain, uplifted an
absolutely unpaalleled large tree. Consuming that army of demons, as a fire at the time of
universal dissolution, the aforesaid monkey made that army unconscious on the battle field, with
many trees.

Shlok 20: Immediately on seeing Hanuma destroying thier army rapidly, thousands of demons
hurled weapons on him.

Shlok 21- 22- 23- 24: Approaching Hanuma looking like a mountain, the demons bearing pointed pikes struck
him from all sides with pkes, those carrying swords in their hands with swords, those carring
javelins in their hands with jalins, with iron rods with maces; those armed with sharp-edged spears
with spears, as also with bright-looking spears, with hundreds of cylindrical wooden pieces studded
with iron spikes, with steel hammers, ,with awful axes, with slings for the rwing stones, with
their thunderbolt-like fists and slaps which fell like flashes of lighning. Then, the enraged
Hanuma made a colossal destruction of those demons.

Shlok 25: That Indrajit saw Hanuma, the foremost of monkeys, looking like a mountain,
fearlessly killing his enemies.

Shlok 26: He spoke the following words tohis charioteer: "Take the chariot to the place where
that monkey is standing. If we neglect him, he will surely destroy our demons."

Shlok 27: Hearing the words of that Indrajit, the charioteer went, carrying that very
unconquerable Indrajit sitting in the chariot, to the place where Hanuma was there.

Shlok 28: Coming close to Hanuma, that unconquerable Indrajit hurled swords, sharp-edged
spears and axes on the head of Hanuma.

Shlok 29: Receiving those terrible weapons, that Hanuma spoke, seized as he was, with great
rage, the following words:

Shlok 30: "O evil-minded Indrajit! If you are valiant, fight with me. Coming nearer to Hanuma,
you will not return alive."

Shlok 31: "O foolish fellow! If you enter into a duel with me, fight with your arms. Withstand
my force in the battle-field. Then you will be considered as the best among the demons."

Shlok 32: Vibhishana told Lakshmana in the following words that while with bow upraised,
Indrajit sought to kill Hanuma.

Shlok 33: "Having seated in a chariot, Indrajit, who conquered Indra, is seeking to kill
Hanuma."

Shlok 34: "O Lakshmana! Kill that Indrajit with your terrific arrows of incomparable
workmanship, which ward off the enemies and putting an end to their lives."

Shlok 35: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, who was fearful to his adversaries, the
great-souled Lakshmana saw Indrajit, who closely resembled a mountain, seated in a chariot, of
terrific strength and who was difficult to approach.



SARGA 87
------------------------------

[Text] Vibhishana takes Lakshmana to the place where indrajit is performing the sacrificial
rite. He advises Lakshmana to destroy Indrajit even before he finishes the sacrificial rite at a
banyan tree. Indrajit sees Vibhishana there and starts talking harsh words to him, saying that he
has ditched him by bringing Lakshmana to that place. Vibhishana replies that because of Ravana's
vices, he has left him and joined Rama's side. He further adds that Indrajit and his army will not
survive under the range of Lakshmana's arrows.

Shlok 1: After speaking to him as aforesaid, Vibhishana taking Lakshmana, who held a bow in
his hand, felt rejoiced and hastened away.

Shlok 2: Moving not very distant from there and entering an extensive thicket, Vibhishana
showed to Lakshmana, the place where Indrajit was going to pour oblations into the sacred fire.

Shlok 3: The glorious Vibhishana showed a terribly looking banyan tree, appearing like a
blace cloud (and spoke as follows).

Shlok 4: "After offering oblations to the spirits at this place, the mighty Indrajit proceeds
to the battle afterwards."

Shlok 5: "Thereupon, this demon becomes invisible to any one, kills some enemies in battle
and binds some with his excellent arrows."

Shlok 6: "Destroy that mighty Indrajit, along with his chariot, horses and charioteer, by
releasing your blazing arrows, even while he has not reached the banyan tree."

Shlok 7: That greatly brilliant Lakshmana, a delight of his fiends, saying 'So be it' took
his stand there, twanging his bow at full length.

Shlok 8: That Indrajit, the son of Ravana, clad in armour, armed with a sword, and
distinguished by his ensign, appeared in a fire-coloured chariot.

Shlok 9: That highly splendid Lakshmana spoke to that Indrajit, the scion of Sage Paulastya,
who had never been conquered before (as follows); "I am inviting you for a fight. Give battle to me
in a right manner."

Shlok 10: Thus spoken by Lakshmana, Indrajit with a great brilliance and high mindedness,
seeing Vibhishana there, spoke the following harsh words to him:

Shlok 11: "O demon! You are born and brought up here. You are a direct brother to my father
and a paternal uncle to me. How can you be hostile to a son?

Shlok 12: "O perverted fellow, an abuser of righteousness! Consanguinity is not a norm for
you, nor friendliness, nor pride of birth, nor a brotherly feeling nor a right conduct."

Shlok 13: "O evil-minded one! You are pitiable and deserve to be reproached by the virtuous,
in that having abandoned your onw kind, you have entered into the service of our enemy."

Shlok 14: "You are not recognizing the great difference because of your feeble mind. Where is
living together with one's own kindred and where is taking refuge with low kind of enemies?

Shlok 15: "Opponents may be virtuous. One's own kindred may not be virtuous. But, a relation,
though bereft of merit is preferable. An enemy is, indeed, ever an enemy."

Shlok 16: "He who, abandoning his own side, takes sides with adversary, is killed, after his
own knsmen are destroyed just by those people of the other side."

Shlok 17: "O Indrajit, the demon! The ruthlessness thus shown by you and the manliness
exhibited by you (in bringing Lakshmana here) could be possible only by you, our own kindred."

Shlok 18: Hearing the words of Indrajit, his brother's son, Vibhishana replied: "O demon! Why
do you speak perversely, as though you are not aware of my nature."

Shlok 19: "O Indrajit the wicked one! Atleast out of respect for the elders, abandon your
harshness. Even if I am born in a demoniac race, which does cruel acts, my nature is goodness,
which is prime virtue of human beings and it is not demoniacal."

Shlok 20: "I neither delight in cruel acts, nor rejoice in unvirtuous acts. How can a brother
be driven away by his brother, even if the former's nature is different?"

Shlok 21: "Renouncing a man of sinful resolve hose conduct has deviated from righteousness,
one attains happiness, as one shakes off a venomous serpent from his hand."

Shlok 22: "The wise men say that an evil-natured fellow, who is intent on taking away other's
property and lustfully touches another's wife, is worth shunning, as one abandons a house in
flames."

Shlok 23: "Three faults produce destruction. Taking away other's property, lustfully touching
another's wife and excessive distrust with one's friends."

Shlok 24- 25: "These faults which destroy one's life and lordship killing great sages terribly,
waging war against all celestials, arrogance, becoming angry very easily, quarrelsomeness, ill-will
have concealed the good qualities of my elder brother, as the clouds conceal the view of
mountains."

Shlok 26: "Because of these vices, Ravana, your father and my brother, has been abandoned by
me. Neither will this City of Lanka will exist any longer nor you nor your father."

Shlok 27: "O demon! You can talk to me as you like, since you are arrogant, foolish,
indisciplined and caught, as you are, in the noose of Death."

Shlok 28: "O the worst of demons! You got this calamity here because you spoke harsh words to
me today. You cannot reach the banyan-tree any longer."

Shlok 29: "It is not possible for you to survive, on attacking Lakshmana. You fight with
Lakshmana, the lord of men, in the battle-field. After being killed, you will do sacred work in the
abode of Yama, the god of Death."

Shlok 30: "Do spend away all your weapons and arrows, by showing your own augmented strength.
Reaching the range of Lakshmana's arrows, you will not indeed return alive with your army
today."



SARGA 88
------------------------------

[Text] A fierce battle of archery starts between Indrajit and Lakshmana. Indrajit strikes
Lakshmana with seven arrows, Hanuma with ten arrows and Vibhishana with a hundred arrows/almost at
the same time. In retaliation, Lakshmana strikes Indrajit with a multiple of arrows and Indrajit's
armour breaks up into pieces. Indrajit, in response, strikes Lakshmana with a thousand arrows and
breaks up Lakshmana's armour. A fierce fight ensues for a long time. Meanwhile, Vibhishana joins
the battle-field, to relieve Lakshmana's fatigue.

Shlok 1: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Indrajit was excited with rage, spoke harsh words
and rushed forward in fury.

Shlok 2- 3: Indrajit was looking like Yama the lord of Death at the time of dissolution of the
world, sitting in a well-decorated and distinguished chariot yoked with black horses, having
upraised sword and weapons, raising a big terrific enormous strong and swift bow and laying hold of
arrows which can torment the enemies.

Shlok 4: The mighty the destroyer of adversaries, wielding a large bow, fully adorned, and
seated in a chariot saw that Lakshmana who was embellished with his own splendor.

Shlok 5: Indrajit hurriedly spoke to those foremost of monkeys and to this Lakshmana, who
ascended Hanuma's back with a splendor of the sun shining on Mount Udaya and also with Vibhishana
as follows: "You behold my prowess now."

Shlok 6: "Now, you can face an unconquerable stream of arrows, like rain, released in the
sky, as discharged from my bow in the battle-field."

Shlok 7: "Today my arrows released from my large bow will destroy your bodies, as fire
consumes a pile of cotton."

Shlok 8: "Today, I will send all of you to the world of Yama the lord of Death, by piercing
you with my sharp arrows and hurling the pikes, javelins and lances on you."

Shlok 9: "Who can stand before me, while I release streams of arrows with my swift-hand in
battle, thundering like a cloud?"

Shlok 10: "Earlier on that day, in a nocturnal battle, both of you along with Sugreeva and
other followers, were made unconscious by my arrows which were like thunderbolts and tips of
missiles as also you were made to fall down on the floor."

Shlok 11: "Do you not have that remembrance? I presume clearly that you are on the road to
Yama the lord of Death, since you have come to give battle to me, enraged as I am, like a venomous
serpent."

Shlok 12: Enraged in hearing that roaring of Indrajit, Lakshmana then spoke the following
words, with a courageous countenance.

Shlok 13: "O demon! It has been proclaimed by you about the successful conclusion of your
tasks, eventhough it is difficult to achieve them. He alone is clever, whoever carries through his
undertakings in practice."

Shlok 14: "O evil-minded one! You are thinking that you have accomplished your end, by
proclaiming through word alone, the achievement of your end, which is difficult to attain for
anyone, though you, as such, lack in capacity to achieve your purpose."

Shlok 15: "The path, which was followed on that day by you, becoming invisible in the
battle-field, is the one trodden by thieves and is not the path followed by valiant ones."

Shlok 16: "O demon! Having reached the range of your arrows, I am standing before you.
Therefore show your prowess today. Why should you brag with your words?

Shlok 17: Hearing those words, the mighty Indrajit, victorious in battle, reaching his
terrific bow, released sharp arrows from it.

Shlok 18: Duly reaching Lakshmana, the arrows released by Indrajit, which rushed with great
speed and were as deadly as the venom of serpents, fell like the hissing of snakes.

Shlok 19: The swift Indrajit, the son of Ravana, with his arrows of very great velocity, in
that battle, struck Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious body-marks.

Shlok 20: That glorious Lakshmana, drenched in blood, with his body very much wounded by
arrows, shone like a smokeless flame.

Shlok 21: Mulling over his own feat, Indrajit for his part, approaching Lakshmana and emitting
an exceedingly loud roar, spoke the following words:

Shlok 22: "The sharp-edged and deadly arrows, with their wings, released from my bow, will now
take your life, O Lakshmana!"

Shlok 23: "O Lakshmana! Let a number of Jackals, multitude of hawks and vultures descend upon
you, when struck down by me, you are dead."

Shlok 24: "The exceedingly evil-minded Rama now itself can see you, a mere kshatriya (military
class only for a name sake), ever ignoble and his devoted brother, killed by me."

Shlok 25: "O Lakshmana! Rama will see you, struck down by me today, with your armour dropped
down, bow thrown about and head dismantled."

Shlok 26: Lakshmana, understanding the sense of the word, replied in the following logical
words to the enraged Indrajit thus speaking harshly.

Shlok 27: "O evil-minded one! Give up strength of speech in your empty words. O demons! You
are doing cruel acts. Why do you indulge in such idle talk? Make it active with your good
work."

Shlok 28: "O demon! Without performing that act, why do you boast yourself here? Perform that
act by which I can believe your brag."

Shlok 29: "O the worst of persons! Without speaking even a few harsh words, without abusing
you and without bragging myself, Lo! I will kill you."

Shlok 30: Thus speaking, Lakshmana stretching five steel arrows upto the ear, dug them into
the demon's chest with a great speed.

Shlok 31: The arrows, blazing like serpents and feathered with fine plumes, shone like
sun-rays in that demon's chest.

Shlok 32: Struck with arrows by Lakshmana, that enraged Indrajit pierced in return three
arrows well-directed towards Lakshmana.

Shlok 33: That fight between Lakshmana, the foremost among men and Indrajit, the formost among
demons, who wished to conquer one over the other in battle, was most terrific and tumultuous.

Shlok 34: Both were endowed with strength. Both were distinguished for their prowess. Both
were exceedingly difficult to conquer and peerless in strength and courage.

Shlok 35: Those two heroes, who were difficult to overcome in battle, fought at that moment
like two plants figuring in the sky and like Indra and Vritra, the demon.

Shlok 36- 37: Then, the two warriors, who were engaged in releasing several streams of arrows,
fought like two lions. Lakshmana the foremost among humans and Indrajit the foremost among demons
fought with rejoice.

Shlok 38: Thereupon, Lakshmana the tormentator of enemies, fitting his arrows to his bow,
released arrows on Indrajit, hissing like an enraged serpent.

Shlok 39: Hearing the twang of the bow-string of Lakshmana, Indrajit the Chief of demons
became pale-faced and fixed his gaze on Lakshmana.

Shlok 40: Seeing Indrajit (the son of Ravana) pale-faced, Vibhishana spoke as follows to
Lakshmana, who was fully absorbed in the fight.

Shlok 41: "O the long-armed Lakshmana! I infer on the strength of the indications which I see
in Indrajit, that he is disappointed. There is no doubt about it. Make haste."

Shlok 42: Thereupon, fitting to his bow sharp arrows, resembling poisonous snakes, Lakshmana
discharged those arrows which looked like serpents full of venom to him.

Shlok 43: Hit by Lakshmana with arrows, which invaded all his senses, like the hit of Indra's
thunderbolt, Indrajit became stupefied for a moment.

Shlok 44: Regaining his consciousness within a moment, with his senses restored, that Indrajit
saw the valiant Lakshmana engaged in the battle.

Shlok 45: With blood-red eyes in anger, Indrajit walked towards Lakshmana. Approaching
Lakshmana, he again spoke the following harsh words to him:

Shlok 46: "Don't you remember my prowess in the first encounter, when you along with your
brother, was bound by me and you wriggled on the floor?"

Shlok 47: "At first, both of you along with your foremost warriors in a major encounter, were
indeed laid down unconscious on the ground, by my arrows which were equal to Indra's
thunderbolt."

Shlok 48: "The fact that you desire to attack me means that either the remembrance of it no
longer exists in you or I presume you desire to go clearly to the abode of Yama the lord of
Death."

Shlok 49: "If my prowess was not witnessed by you in the first encounter, I will show it
today. Stand ready for it now."

Shlok 50: Thus speaking, he struck Lakshmana with seven arrows and Hanuma with ten excellent
sharp-edged arrows.

Shlok 51: Then, the valiant Idnrajit with anger and with twice as much vehemence, wounded
Vibhishana with a hundred well-aimed arrows.

Shlok 52- 53: Seeing that feat accomplished by Indrajit, yet disregarding it, deriding it by
saying "This is noting" and taking up terrific arrows, the fearless and enraged Lakshmana the
younger brother of Rama and foremost among men, then discharged them against Indrajit in
battle.

Shlok 54: "O demon! Heroes who come to battle do not strike like this. These arrows of yours
are light, weak and mild indeed."

Shlok 55: "Warriors, who wish to win in battle, do not fight like this." Thus speaking,
Lakshmana the wielder of a bow, streamed forth arrows on him.

Shlok 56: A large golden armour, broken to pieces by Lakshmana's arrows, slipped down in the
middle of chariot, like a cob-web of stars falling from the sky.

Shlok 57: The valiant Indrajit, with his armour disheveled by the steel arrows, was wounded in
battle and looked like the sun at dawn.

Shlok 58: Thereafter, the valiant Indrajit of terrific prowess was enraged and wounded
Lakshmana with a thousand arrows in battle.

Shlok 59: The large celestial armour of Lakshmana broke into pieces. The two warriors vied
with each other in offence and retaliation in their attack.

Shlok 60: Those two warriors, with their entire bodies lacerated in combat, smeared with blood
all around and breathing heavily, fought the battle tumultuously.

Shlok 61: Thos mighty warriors, skilled in warfare, were cutting through each other, for a
long time, with sharp arrows.

Shlok 62: Those two heroes f terrific prowess stay on strenuously trying to secure their own
victory, covered as they were, all over with a multitude of arrows as also their armour and
standards torn to pieces. They stood emitting hot blood, as two water-falls gushing hot water.

Shlok 63- 64: Much of a time lapsed while the two warriors fought loosing terrific stream of
arrows, then with an awful clamour, like two dark destructive clouds raining from the sky. They
neither trned their back from the battle, nor experienced any fatigue.

Shlok 65: Displaying their missiles again and again, the two warriors, who were excellent
among those skilled in the use missiles, fastened a net work of arrows both large and small, in the
sky.

Shlok 66: Loosing their arrows faultlessly, gracefully and easily in a wonderful way, both the
man and the demon carried on a tumultuous and terrific war.

Shlok 67: Their terrific and tumultuous sound could be heard one by one repeatedly. That sound
created a tremble in people, like a violent thunder-storm.

Shlok 68: That clamour of those two warriors, who were engaged thus in that martial act,
resembled the rumbling of two dreadful thundering clouds in the sky.

Shlok 69: Those two mighty and glorious warriors, who were determined to gain victory over one
another, wounded with golden-shafted steel arrows, were profusely giving out blood.

Shlok 70: Fallen on their limbs, the golden-shafted arrows, dropped on the battle-field,
smeared with blood and pierced into the surface of the earth.

Shlok 71: Some more arrows released by those two warriors clashed in thousands with sharp
weapons in the sky and shattered and tore them.

Shlok 72: The terrific pile of arrows in battle appeared like a mass of sacred Kusha grass by
the side of two blazing fires at a sacrifice.

Shlok 73: The wounded bodies of those two mighty warriors shone like Kimshuka and Shalmali
(silk-cotton) trees in full blossom, deprived of leaves.

Shlok 74: Indrajit and Lakshmana who were time and again wishing to attain victory one over
the other, carried out tumultuous and terrific battle.

Shlok 75: In the combat, Lakshmana was striking Indrajit and Indrajit too was striking
Lakshmana. Both of them were striking each other and did not experience any weariness.

Shlok 76: With a multitude of arrows dug deep into their bodies, those two warriors, of great
prowess and swiftness, shone like two mountains shooting forth plants from them.

Shlok 77: At that time, all their limbs, dampened with blood and thickly covered with arrows
shone very much like blazing fires.

Shlok 78: A lot of time lapsed in the meanwhile past the two warriors. They neither turned
their back from the battle nor experienced any fatigue.

Shlok 79: Then, to relieve martial weariness of Lakshmana, who did not experience defeat in
any facet of war, the great-souled Vibhishana, offering agreeable and salutary words, took up his
position, on reaching the battle-field.

words to the chiefs of monkeys urging them to carry on the combat. The monkeys start a furious
attack on the demons. Even Hanuma begins to destroy thousands of demons. Indrajit rushes towards
Lakshmana and starts fighting with him. Lakshmana kills Indrajit's charioteer. Four excellent
monkey-chiefs kill Indrajit's horses and destroys his chariot.

valiant demns in battle, with pikes, sowrds and sharp-edged spears.

Shlok 6: Surrounded by those demons, Vibhishana shone like an elephant in the midst of proud
young tuskers.

Shlok 7: Vibhishana, who knew the timing, spoke to the monkeys, who cherished to destroy the
demons, the following opportune words duly inspiring them.

Shlok 8: "O cheifs of monkeys! Here stands before you, one who is the last support of Ravana.
He is all that is left in his force. Why do you stand idle?"

Shlok 9: "At the end of this war, if this sinful demon is killed, the remaining army is as
good as killed, except Ravana."

Shlok 10: Prahasta was killed. The valiant Nikumbha, the mighty Kumbhakarna, Kumbha, the demon
called Dhumraksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, the highly swift Ashaniprabha, Suptaghna, Yajnakopa, a

Shlok 15: Having killed these many mighty and foremost of demons and having swun the ocen, let
the tiny puddle be crossed.

Shlok 16: "O monkeys! Only this much of army remains yet to be conquered here. All the demons,
who were proud of their strength, having come to the battle-field here, were killed by you."

Shlok 17: "Driving away tenderness, for the sake of Rama, I will kill my own brother's son
though being his uncle (who is as good as a father), it is not appropriate for me to compose his
death."

Shlok 18: "My eyes are getting cluded with tear, even when I think of killing him. This
long-armed Lakshmana alone will finish him. O Monkeys! All of you, together, kill his servents
standing beside him."

Shlok 19: Thus impelled by that illustrious Vibhishana, those monkey-chiefs were rejoiced and
lashed their tails (in a happy mood).

Shlok 20: Then, those monkeys-cheifs, roaring time and again, emitted various kinds of sounds
resembling the sounds of peacocks at the time of seeing the clouds.

Shlok 21: Even Jambavan and those monkeys, accompanied by all those, who belong to their
identical troops, began to strike the demons with stones, nails and teeth.

Shlok 22: Those mighty demons, having various kinds of weapons, abandoning their fear,
surrounded that Jambavan, who was playing havoc on them.

Shlok 23: They struck Jambavan, who was killing the army of demons in battle, with sharp axes,
spears with sharp edges, sticks and javelins.

Shlok 24: That tumultuous and terrific battle accompanied by a great noise, occured between
the monkeys and the demons as between enraged celestials and demons.

Shlok 25- 26: That haughty Hanuma too who felt enraged, causing Lakshmana to descend from his

those demons in their thousands.

Shlok 27: That mighty Indrajit, the destroyer valiant enemies, after giving a tumultuous fight
to his uncle, yet again rushed towards Lakshmana.

Shlok 28: The two valiant celebreties, Lakshmana and Indrajit, the two intense fighters in
battle, then began to strike each other, showering a multitude of arrows on their enemies.

Shlok 29: The mighty and energetic Lakshmana and Indrajit covered each other off exceedingly
by a network of arrows, in the same way as the sun and the moon are veiled by clouds at the end of
summer.

Shlok 30- 31: Due to lightness of their hands, even as they fight there, neither the holding of
the bow, nor the taking off the arrows, nor fitting them on their bow-string, nor adjusting their
fists, nor drawing the bow-string nor attaining the target was visible.

Shlok 32: The sky, having been covered by a multitude of arrows, on all sides, discharged with
force by them both, was shrouded in darkness.

Shlok 33: Meeting Indrajit, Lakshmana fought with him. Meeting Lakshmana, Indrajit too took
the offensive. As they clashed with each other, there was terrible confusion (as to who would win
ultimately).

Shlok 34: By the sharp arrows released almost continuously with the sky was covered with
darkness.

Shlok 35: By the fall of a multitude of their sharp arrows in hundreds, the quarters and
sub-quarters were filled with arrows.

Shlok 36: All the space was covered with darkness, showing up great fear. While the sun was
setting down, encircling darkness all over, large streams of blood in plenty poured out.

Shlok 37: Cruel and carnivorous animals diffused awful sounds with their roaring noise. Wind
did not blow at that time nor the wind blazed up.

Shlok 38: Those great sages proclaimed, "May it be well for the (three) worlds!" The
frightened Gandharvas the celestial musicians along with Charanas, the wandering singers arrived
there to see tha battle-field.

Shlok 39: By discharging four arrows, Lakshmana then struck four black gold-adorned horses of
Indrajit.

Shlok 40- 41- 42: Thereupon, with alacrity of his hand, that illustrious Lakshmana, fully stretching
and releasing another sharp thunderbolt-like arrow, named Bhalla, which was yellowish in colour,
with charming plumes, having a good splendour similar to Indra's thunderbolt and echoing a clapping
sound, severed the head of Indrajit's charioteer from his trunk, even as he was circling
around.

Shlok 43: When the charioteer was killed, the greatly splendoured Indrajit did the
charioteering by himself and also took hold of his bow.

Shlok 44: For them, who saw his capability in that battle, it looked wonderful. When he was
driving his horses, Lakshmana struck him with sharp arrows. When he was attending to his bow, he
released arrows on horses.

Shlok 45: Lakshmana, who was swift in his acts, tormented Indrajit who was ranging the
battle-field fearlessly, with a multitude of arrows on such opportune occasions.

Shlok 46: Seeing his charioteer killed in battle, Indrajit became dejected and los this
entusiasm in undertaking the combat.

Shlok 47: Seeing Indrajit with a despondent face, the monkey-chiefs were very much dejected
and then acclaimed Lakshmana.

Shlok 48: Then, four monkey-leaders named Pramathi, Rabhasa, Sharabha and Gandhamadana,
getting impatient, acted hastily.

Shlok 49: Those four mokeys, having a great might and terrible prowess, quickly bounced and
descended on his ecellent horses.

Shlok 50: Blood started flowing from the mouths of those horses pressed under the weight of
those monkeys, as huge as mountains.

Shlok 51- 52: Those crushed orses, with their limbs broken as also moving to and fro, fell down
dead on the ground. After killing his hrses, those monkeys also crushed that great chariot and
jumping up again with speed, they stood by the side of Lakshmana.

Shlok 53: That Indrajit; hatasaarathiH= whose charioteer was killed hataashvaat= and whose
horses were destroyed; avaplutya= leaped down; rathaat= from his chariot; abhyadhaavata= and
attacked; saumitrim= Lakshmana; sharavarSheNa= with streams of arrows.

Shlok 54: Then, that Lakshmana like Indra the lord of celestials, restrained those arrows with
many a number of his arrows. That Indrajit was coming on foot, as his excellent ohrses had been
killed and began to release exquisite sharp arrows in battle.



SARGA 90

[Text] Indrajit goes back to Lanka and brings another chariot with him. He attacks the
monkeys severely. The monkeys seek refuge in Lakshmana. Indrajit and Lakshmana continue a fierce
battle with their bow and arrows. Lakshmana destroys Indrajit's chariot. Indrajit strikes three
arrows in Lakshmana's forehead and Lakshmana strikes five arrows on Indrajit's face. When Indrajit
strikes Vibhishana with arrows, Vibhishana kills Indrajit's horses. Fitting a missile presided over
by Indra the lord of celestials, Lakshmana addressed a prayer on Rama and discharged it towards
Indrajit. Indrajit's head gets chopped off and falls to the ground. Witnessing Indrajit's death,
all the monkey-chiefs, Vibhishana, Hanuma and Jambavan applaud Lakshmana.

Shlok 1: Indrajit, the demon, who was endowed with extraordinary energy, standing on the
ground his horses having been killed; was very much enraged and blazed with spirit.

Shlok 2: Those two warriors, holding their bows, having an extreme intent to kill each other
with their arrows, were like two excellent elephants going out in the forest for the purpose of
conquering one over the other.

Shlok 3: Those demons and monkeys, rushing from all sides, destroying each other, did not
desert their masters in battle.

Shlok 4: Applauding and causing rejoice to all the demons and even feeling delighted himself,
Indrajit then spoke the following words:

Shlok 5: "These quarters are wrapped on all sides with abundant darkness. O foremost of
demons! It can not be identified at this time whether one belongs to one's own army or an
enemy.

Shlok 6: "You courageously fight, so as to stupefy the monkeys. I, on my part, will return to
the battle-field, ascending another chariot."

Shlok 7: "You act in such a way so that these evil-minded monkeys do not carry on their fight
(with me) while enter the city."

Shlok 8: Thus speaking, Indrajit the annihilator of enemies, having deceived the monkeys,
entered the City of Lanka for the sake of getting anther chariot.

Shlok 9- 10: Arranging for embellishment of a chariot, which was beautiful, decked with gold,
furnished with darts, swords and arrows, yoked with excellent horses, directed by a charioteer who
could understand those horses properly and could give credible instructions to them, that Indrajit,
a conqueror in battle, who was endowed with extraordinary energy, then ascended it.

Shlok 11: That valiant Indrajit, surrounded by troops of principal demons and incited by the
force of destiny, sallied forth from the city.

Shlok 12: Moving out form the City with his swift horses, that indrajit, the destroyer of
valiant enemies, attacked Lakshmana and Vibhishana.

Shlok 13: Seeing Idnrajit seated in the chariot, Lakshmana, the mighty monkeys and Vibhishana
the demon then were very much surprised on recalling the alacrity of the intelligent Indrajit.

Shlok 14: The enraged Indrajit also struck down hundreds and thousands of monkey-chiefs by
using a multitude of arrows in the battle-field.

Shlok 15: Stretching his bow to a circle, that enraged Indrajit the conqueror in battle,
exhibiting supreme agility, began to kill the monkeys.

Shlok 16: Thus being killed by steel arrows, those monkeys of terrible prowess sought refuge
in Lakshmana, as people would take refuge in Brahma the Lord of Creation.

Shlok 17: Then, blazing with hostile anger, Lakshmana, showing his agility of hand, tore
Indrajit's bow.

Shlok 18: Hurriedly, he took another bow and made it ready. Lakshmana tore that bow too of
Indrajit with three arrows.

Shlok 19: Thereupon, Lakshmana struck that Indrajit, whose bow was torn, on his chest with
five arrows which were deadly like a serpentine poison.

Shlok 20: Those arrows, released from that great bow, penetrating through Indrajit's body,
fell to the ground like huge red serpents.

Shlok 21: Ejecting blood from his month, that Indrajit, who had his bow torn, took hold of his
excellent bow with the bow-string firmly fastened and which was stronger than the earlier bow.

Shlok 22: Employing utmost agility, Indrajit, aiming at Lakshmana, streamed forth a shower of
arrows, as Indra the lord of celestials streaming forth the rain.

Shlok 23: Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies coolly warded off the shower of arrows released
by Indrajit, though it was most difficult to resist.

Shlok 24: Lakshmana with great splendor, remaining unperplexed, then showed his prowess to
Indrajit, which was marvelous indeed.

Shlok 25- 26: Getting extremely enraged, Lakshmana then pierced all those demons who stood in the
battle-field with three arrows each, showing his speed in discharging missiles and also struck
Indrajit with an array of arrows.

Shlok 27: That Indrajit, who was struck by the enemy, who was mighty destroyer of enemies,
released several arrows unhindered towards Lakshmana.

Shlok 28: Lakshmana, the destroyer of valiant adversaries, tore those arrows yet unarrived,
with sharp arrows. The virtuous Lakshmana eliminated the head of the charioteer of Indrajit, the
chariot-warrior, in the battle with an arrow called Bhalla which was looking curved at its
nodes.

Shlok 29: Those horses, bereft of a charioteer there, without getting perturbed, ran up in a
circular fashion and continued to draw the chariot. The scene looked wonderful indeed.

Shlok 30: Getting the power of anger, Lakshmana of unyielding prowess, pierced the horses of
Indrajit with arrows, so as to frighten them thereby.

Shlok 31: Getting impatient with that act of Lakshmana in battle, Indrajit struck that enraged
Lakshmana with ten arrows.

Shlok 32: Those arrows of Indrajit, equal to thunderbolts and deadly as serpentine poison,
having reached Lakshmana's armour with a golden hue, got destroyed.

Shlok 33- 34: Understanding Lakshmana to have been protected by an impenetrable armour and showing
his swiftness in discharging missiles, Indrajit the son of Ravana, who felt very much angered,
pierced Lakshmana in the forehead with three arrows provided with good plumes.

Shlok 35: With those three arrows planted in his forehead, Lakshmana who was fond of fighting,
shone like a mountain with its three peaks, in the battle-field.

Shlok 36: Thus tormented in battle by Indrajit the demon, that Lakshmana then quickly
stretching the bow, pierced him in return with five arrows, in battle, in Indrajit's face holding
beautiful ear-rings.

Shlok 37: Lakshmana Indrajit, the heroes endowed with extraordinary might and armed with very
strong bows and possessing terrible prowess, struck each other with distinctly pointed arrows.

Shlok 38: Those two warriors, Lakshmana and Indrajit, with both their bodies stained in blood,
shone in the battle-field at that time, like Kimshuka trees in blossom.

Shlok 39: Those two archers, with their minds directed towards victory, met each other and
pierced their opponent in all limbs with dreadful arrows.

Shlok 40: Then, Indrajit, filled with martial anger, struck Vibhishana in his auspicious face,
with three arrows.

Shlok 41: Having struck Vibhishana, the leader of demons, with three arrows, Indrajit struck
all those monkey chiefs with a single arrow each.

Shlok 42: Very much enraged with him, that Vibhishana of great splendor killed the horses of
that evil-minded Indrajit with his mace.

Shlok 43: Just leaping down from the chariot whose charioteer was destroyed earlier and whose
horses were killed, that Indrajit of great splendor employed his javelin towards his maternal
uncle.

Shlok 44: Seeing that Javelin rushing towards Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it into ten pieces
with his sharp arrows and felled it on the floor.

Shlok 45: The strong bodied Vibhishana, in anger, dug five arrows, whose impact was a hard as
that of a thunder-bolt, into the bosom of Indrajit, whose horses were already killed.

Shlok 46: Having penetrated his body, those arrows which were provided with golden feathers,
went straight into their target, got stained with blood and appeared like red large serpents.

Shlok 47: Enraged with his paternal uncle, that Indrajit, standing in the midst of demons,
took hold of an excellent arrow earlier presented by Yama the lord of Death.

Shlok 48: Seeing that great arrow seized by him, Lakshmana also, of great splendor and
terrible prowess, took hold of another arrow.

Shlok 49: That arrow had been presented to him, in the course of a dream, by Kubera the god of
riches, of immense glory himself, which was difficult to be conquered and much more difficult to be
tolerated even for gods and demons including Indra the lord of celestials.

Shlok 50: Stretched with strength by their arms, which resembled a pair of steel rods, emitted
a piercing sound like that of a pair of curlew-cranes.

Shlok 51: The excellent arrows fitted and pulled out from their excellent bow by those heroes,
blazed very much with splendour.

Shlok 52: Those arrows, released from the bow, making the sky shine and hitting each other
face to face, collided each other powerfully.

Shlok 53: The collision of those arrows of terrible form broke out a fierce fire comprising of
smoke and sparkles.

Shlok 54: Hitting each other like two major planets, those two arrows in battle burst into a
hundred pieces and fell on the ground.

Shlok 55: On seeing their arrows warded off in the battle-front, those two warriors, Lakshmana
and Indrajit then felt abashed and got provoked.

Shlok 56: Getting excited, Lakshmana took hold of a missile presided over by Varuna (the god
of water). Skilled in warfare, the great Indrajit too discharged a missile presided over by Rudra
(the god of destruction) in battle.

Shlok 57- 58: By that Rudra missile, that very wonderful Varuna-missile was struck. Then, that
enraged Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battle, looking like the destroyer of the
world, employed a missile presided over by Agni the god of fire which was blazing.

Shlok 59: The valiant Lakshmana obstructed Agni-missile, by a missile presided over by the
sun-god. Finding his missile repelled, Indrajit was filled with anger and took hold of a sharp
arrow used by demons and capable of tearing down an enemy.

Shlok 60: From that bow, blazing weapon similar to a hammer duly hidden, darts, fire arms,
maces, swords and axes rushed forth.

Shlok 61- 62: Seeing that terrible missile, which was very harsh, unrestrainable for all beings
and which can tear all weapons in battle, the brilliant Lakshmana obstructed that missile by using
Maheswara-missile.

Shlok 63: There was a wonderful battle between both of them, causing hair to stand erect. The
beings in the sky surrounded Lakshmana.

Shlok 64: Surrounded by many surprised beings in that terrible battle taking place between
monkeys and demons, yielding terrific noise, the sky sparkled.

Shlok 65: Placing Indra the lord of celestials as their head, the sages, manes, gods,
Gandharvas the celestial musicians, eagles and serpents protected Lakshmana in the
battle-field.

Shlok 66: Then, Lakshmana fitted another excellent arrow, which had a sensation of ignition
and which can tear down Indrajit.

Shlok 67- 68: The heroic Lakshmana fitted the arrow, having beautiful plumes, which consisted of
rounded parts, well-jointed, skillfully fashioned, decked with gold, capable of destroying the body
of the enemies, not difficult to keep off but difficult even to tolerate, a source of terror to the
demons as deadly as the venom of poisonous snakes and duly honoured by the host of gods.

Shlok 69: With the help of that arrow, the highly powerful and valiant Indra, the lord of
celestials, who had green horses to his chariot, was able to conquer the demons in a combat which
raged between celestials and demons.

Shlok 70: Fitting a missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, which had never
been defeated in battle, to his excellent bow and drawing it, the glorious Lakshmana addressed the
following prayer, which was intended to achieve his purpose:

Shlok 71: "O my dear arrow! If Rama the son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue, keeps up
his promise and is second to none in his prowess, destroy this Indrajit."

Shlok 72: Thus saying and drawing up to the ear the arrow, which went straight, the heroic
Lakshmana released it towards Indrajit.

Shlok 73- 74: 75. tat mahat shiraH= that large head; raakShasatanuujasya= of Indrajit; bhinna
skandham= separated from his trunk; rudhirokShitam= and moistened with blood; dadR^ishe= appeared;
bhuumau= on the ground; tapaniiya nibham= shining like gold.

Shlok 75: That large head of Indrajit, separated from his trunk and moistened with blood, was
seen on the ground, shining like gold.

Shlok 76: Having been killed, that Indrajit then forthwith fell to the ground, along with his
armour and head-protector, with his bow shattered.

Shlok 77: As Indrajit was killed, all those monkeys together with Vibhishana roared in
rejoice, as the celestials did, when Vritra the demon was killed.

Shlok 78: Then, a shout of victory rose in the sky from the mouth of gods, great-souled sages,
Gandharvas the celestial musicians and the celestial nymphs.

Shlok 79: Seeing him fallen, that great army of demons, being struck by monkeys shining with
victory, sought the quarters.

Shlok 80: Abandoning their weapons, while being struck by the monkeys, those demons went
towards Lanka, running fast stupefied.

Shlok 81: All those frightened demons, abandoning their weapons sharp-edged spears, swords and
axes ran away in hundreds to various directions.

Shlok 82: Tormented by the monkeys, some were scared and entered Lanka. Some fell into the
ocean. Some took refuge in the mountain.

Shlok 83: Seeing Indrajit killed and lying on the battle-field, not even one among the
thousands of demons was to be seen.

Shlok 84: As the sun-rays do not exist when the sun has sunk below the horizon, so those
demons left to different directions when Indrajit had fallen.

Shlok 85: Thrown asunder and dead, that long-armed Indrajit looked like the sun whose rays
have cooled down and like the fire which is extinguished.

Shlok 86: When Indrajit was fallen, the world then had its oppressions pacified, now that its
enemy had been destroyed and it experience a rejoice.

Shlok 87: While that demon of sinful deeds is having been killed, the illustrious Indra the
ruler of gods along with all the great sages were rejoiced.

Shlok 88: In the sky too was heard the sound of large drums played by celestials, the melody
produced by dancing Apsaras the celestial nymphs and the songs of Gandharvas the celestial
musicians.

Shlok 89: While that demon of cruel deeds was killed, a deluge of flowers rained along with
showers of praises. It was a wonderful scene.

Shlok 90: While that Indrajit, who was the terror of all the worlds, had fallen, the waters
and the sky became clear. The celestials and demons were rejoiced and arrived on the scene.

Shlok 91: The gratified celestials, Gandharvas the celestial musicians and the demons said:
"Let the Brahmanas move about cheerfully, now that their trouble has ceased."

Shlok 92: Seeing that foremost among demons, who was unrivalled in battle, having been killed,
the rejoiced monkey-chiefs applauded Lakshmana.

Shlok 93: Vibhishana, Hanuma and Jambavan the chief of bears were pleased at Lakshmana for his
victor and applauded him too.

Shlok 94: The monkeys, who accomplished their aim, roaring, jumping with joy and emitting
thundering sounds, stood encircling Lakshmana.

Shlok 95: Wagging their tails and lashing them, the monkeys then gave forth the slogan,
"Victorious is Lakshmana!"

Shlok 96: Embracing each other with rejoiced minds, the monkeys indulged in good conversations
about Lakshmana and his manifold qualities.

Shlok 97: Hearing Indrajit having been killed and witnessing that arduous act of Lakshmana,
their beloved friend in battle, the celestials were gratified and experienced a great rejoice in
their minds.



SARGA 91

[Text] Lakshmana and Vibhishana approach Rama and inform him that Indrajit's head has been
chopped off. Rama was delighted with the news and applauds Lakshmana, by embracing him. Rama gets
Lakshmana and others treated by Sushena. After the medical treatment by Suhena, Lakshmana becomes
sound, active and full of joy.

Shlok 1: Lakshmana, endowed with auspicious bodily marks, whose limbs were drenched in blood,
felt rejoiced on having killed Indrajit in combat.

Shlok 2- 3: Having offered salutation to Jambavan, Hanuma and all those monkeys, that valiant
Lakshmana of great brilliance then quickly came from there to the place where Sugreeva and Rama
were there, by leaning himself upon vibhishana and Hanuma.

Shlok 4: Having offered his salutation and approached Rama, Lakshmana stood beside his
brother, even as Lord Vamana (the younger brother of Indra) would stand beside Indra the lord of
celestials.

Shlok 5: Then, the valiant Lakshmana, arriving at the great-souled Rama, told him in a
murmering tone (as he was feeling tiresome) about the terrific destroyal of Indrajit.

Shlok 6: Then, the rejoiced Vibhishana informed (in a clear tone) to Rama that Indrajit's

prowess obtained immesurable joy and spoke the following words

Shlok 8: "O Lakshmana! Well done! I feel gratified. An ardous act has been done. Consider it
as our victory, through the destroyal of Indrajit.

Shlok 9- 10: Smelling the head of that Lakshmana, who had augmented his fame and yet who was
feeling abashed (to hear himself being praised), forcibly drawing him to his lap and placing that
Lakshmana his younger brother in his lap with affection, wounded as he was, that valiant Rama,
having embraced him, tenderly gazed upon him affectionately again and again.

Shlok 11- 12: Smelling once more the head of that Lakshmana, who was feeling tormented by the
arrows that had penetrted into his body, who had been wounded, who was breathing heard, who was
endowed with auspicious characterestics, was afflicted with agony and was feeling paine dat the
time of respiration, and hurriedly stroking him as well as restoring confidence in him, Rama the
foremost among men spoke the following words:

Shlok 13: "An extremely noble act was performed by you, a doer of difficult things. Now, that
his son having been killed, I account Ravana to have been killed in battle."

Shlok 14- 15: "As that evil-minded enenmy has been killed, I become victorious. O valiant
Lakshmana! Fortunately, you indeed severed the right hand of the cruel Ravana. Indrajit is indeed
the support for that Ravana. Vibhishana and Hanuma too performed a great feat in the great
battle."

Shlok 16: "In the course of three days and nights, the valiant Indrajit was felled down
somehow. Now, I have been made free of enemies. Hearing of his son having been struck down, Ravana
will indeed come forth with a great and powerful battle-array."

Shlok 17: "By encircling that Ravana, who is difficult to be conquered, with a great army, I
will kill him, who is coming forth with a feeling of distress for the death of his son."

Shlok 18: "O Lakshmana! As that Indrajit has been killed in battle by you, who are my
protector, neither Seetha nor this entire earth is hard to attain."

Shlok 19: Having thus consoled Lakshmana and having embraced him, that Rama who was born in
Raghu-dynansty, was duly delighted and by calling Sushena, spoke to him the following words:

Shlok 20: "O highly intelligent one! You attend upon this wounded Lakshmana, who is fond of
frinds, so that he will become perfectly well in health."

Shlok 21- 22: Let Lakshmana along with Vibhishana be quickly made free from pain caused by the
arrows that have penetrated into their body. Let all others too among the gallant bear and
monkey-warriors fighting with trees who have fought on the battle-field here and stand pierced with
arrows and owunded, be healed in the same way with great care."

Shlok 23: As commanded by Rama, the great-souled Sushena, the monkey-cheif gave an excellent
medicine through nose to Lakshmana.

Shlok 24: Inhaling the odour of that herb, Lakshmana became healed of the arrow-wounds, free
from pains and his wounds got completely cured.

Shlok 25: As per the order of Rama, Sushena then treated his companions like Vibhishana and
others including all the monkey-chiefs.

Shlok 26: Then, with his arrow-wounds healed, his fatigue gone and his feverishness cured
within a moment, Lakshmana having restored his original disposition, felt joyful there.

Shlok 27: Then, on seeing Lakshmana standing up with sound health, Rama, Sugreeva, Vibhishana
and the valiant Jambavan along with the army were rejoiced for a long time.

Shlok 28: That great-souled Rama apllauded the ardous feat of Lakshmana. Hearing of Indrajit
having been kille din battle, Sugreeva became delighted.



SARGA 92
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana feels distressed in hearing the news of his son's death. He gets enraged and
after deeply pondering over, decides to kill Seetha, who was the root of all this trouble. Ravana
with a sword in his hand, sallies forth towards Ashoka garden to make a short work of Seetha.
Seetha observes Ravana rushing towards her and laments that after killing Rama and Lakshmana, he is
coming to her place to kill her. Beholding the lamentation of Seetha, Suparshva, a good and upright
minister of Ravana advises Ravana to desist from that dastardly act and to divert his anger towards
Rama in battle. Ravana accepts the advice of his minister and returns to his assembly-hall.

Shlok 1: Hearing of Indrajit's killing and having ascertained the news, Ravana's counsellors
reported the matter hurriedly to Ravana.

Shlok 2: "O monarch! Your great majestic son has been killed by Lakshmana with the help of
Vibhishana, while we were witnessing the event in the battle-field."

Shlok 3: "Your valiant son, who was unbeatable in combats and that hero who conquered Indra
the lord of celestials, having collided with valiant Lakshmana, has been killed. Having tormented
Lakshmana with his arrows, Indrajit departed to the highest world."

Shlok 4: Hearing that news of formidable, harsh and terrific death of Indrajit his son in
battle, Ravana gave way to a protracted swoon.

Shlok 5: Regaining his consciousness after a long time, the king Ravana, confounded as he was
with sorrow on account of his son's death and with his mind confused, lamented as follows depressed
as he was.

Shlok 6: "Alas! My child, the chief of the army of demons, having extraordinary might! Having
conquered Indra, how have you been subjected to the power of Lakshmana now?"

Shlok 7: "Certainly, when enraged, you would pierce with your arrows in battle, even the
all-destroying time in the form of Yama the Lord of Death and even the peaks of Mount Mandara. What
to tell about Lakshmana?"

Shlok 8: "O the long armed one! Highly esteemed to me is the king Yama, son of sun-god, by
whom you have been subjected to the ravages of time today."

Shlok 9: "This is the path for great warriors even among all the celestial hosts. That male
offspring who is killed for the cause of his lord, obtains heaven."

Shlok 10: "Seeing Indrajit having been killed, all the hosts of celestials, the guardians of
the world and the great sages now can sleep comfortably and peacefully."

Shlok 11: "Bereft of Indrajit alone, the entire earth with its forest appear to be wholly
alone to me. Nay, even the three worlds!"

Shlok 12: "Now, I shall hear the hue and cry of the demon-maidens in the gynaecium, even as
one would hear the roar of a troop of female-elephants in a mountain cave."

Shlok 13: "O destroyer of enemies! Where did you go leaving the rank of Prince Regent as also
Lanka, the demons, your mother and myself, your wives and all of us."

Shlok 14: "O hero! The obsequies rights in my honour ought to have been done by you,
consequent upon my death in future. You are, however, following a reverse path."

Shlok 15: "Deserting us without taking away my tormentation, while Sugreeva, lakshmana and
Rama are still alive, where have you gone?"

Shlok 16: A huge rage enveloped Ravana, the king of demons, born of his son's death, while he
was feeling distressed through grief as aforesaid.

Shlok 17: The anguishes occasioned by the death of his son, flared up further for him, who by
his very nature, was wrathful, as rays of the sun flare up the blazing sun in summer.

Shlok 18: With his eye brows joined together on his forehead, he shone brightly like an ocean,
at the time of the dissolution of the world, with crocodiles and giant waves.

Shlok 19: While he was yawning with anger; a fire with smoke, as though clearly burning, broke
out from his mouth, as it did from the month of Vritra (in the former days).

Shlok 20: Afflicted with the grief of his son's killing, that valiant Ravana got wrapped up in
wrath and pondering with his mind, craved for the killing of Seetha.

Shlok 21: The dreadful eyes of that Ravana, which were red in colour by their very nature and
were red even by the fire of his wrath, looked glittering.

Shlok 22: That naturally terrific form of Ravana, filled with the fire of his wrath, became
difficult to be approached, like the form of enraged Rudra the god of destruction.

Shlok 23: Drops of tears fell down from his enraged eyes, as drops of oil with flames fall
down from blazing lamps.

Shlok 24: The sound of his teeth, produced from the friction of his teeth as he ground them,
were heard like the noise of a large machine being bragged by the demons.

Shlok 25: Trembling with fear, the demons hid themselves, in whichever quarter to which he
directed his look, enraged as he was, like the fire of universal dissolution.

Shlok 26: Demons could not go towards Ravana, who was looking at all the four quarters, like
the enraged Yama the god of Death, who wants to devour both the mobile and the immobile
creatures.

Shlok 27: Desirous of posting the demons to the battle-field, Ravana the king of demons, who
was very much enraged, then spoke as follows, in their midst:

Shlok 28: "Brahma the lord of creation was gratified by me, by performing a stupendous
austerity for thousands of years, at the conclusion of those austerities."

Shlok 29: "As a consequence of that austerity alone and by the grace of Brahma the lord of
creation, there was never a fear for me either from the demons or from the celestials."

Shlok 30: "In the course of combats with the gods and demons, the armour gifted to me by
Brahma, the lord of creation, which is as brilliant as the sun, could not be mutilated by those who
held the thunderbolt in their fists."

Shlok 31: "Who will, be it Indra himself, dare to attack me on the battle-field now, when
mounted on chariot on this field of battle, and duly wearing the aforesaid armour?"

Shlok 32- 33: "Let that large bow of mine, which was given at that time to me along with arrows by
the gracious Brahma the lord of creation, on the occasion of my combat between gods and demons, be
taken out today to the accompaniment of a band of musical instruments, for the purpose of killing
Rama and Lakshmana in the great battle."

Shlok 34: That cruel Ravana, afflicted as he was with grief at the killing of his son, was
subjected to anger and deeply pondering with his mind, decided kill Seetha.

Shlok 35: Looking fixedly with blood-red eyes on all those demons, who were making miserable
sounds, that very awful Ravana for his part, who had assumed a terrible appearance, though feeling
distressed, spoke to them as follows:

Shlok 36: "In order to hoodwink the monkeys, something which had been killed there, was shown,
by taking recourse to conjuring tricks, as Seetha, by my child (Indrajit)"

Shlok 37- 38: "I shall make that hoax into a hard reality, which is pleasing to me. I shall
destroy Seetha, who is devoted to Rama, a bad warrior". Thus speaking to his counsellors, he
swiftly drew his sword.

Shlok 39- 40: The enraged Ravana, who was very much agitated in mind because of the grief for his
son's death, springing up suddenly and taking his excellent sword, having the dazzle of a clear
sky, sallied forth from the assembly hall along with his ministers swiftly and quickly to the place
where Seetha was.

Shlok 41: Seeing Ravana going, his followers emitted a lion's roar. Seeing the enraged Ravana
and embracing each other, they spoke as follows:

Shlok 42: "Both those brothers (Rama and Lakshmana), on seeing him now in fury, will get
perturbed. Indeed even the four guardians of the world had been frightened by him, who was in fury.
Many other enemies were also frightened by him in various battles."

Shlok 43: "Fetching precious things existing in all the three worlds, Ravana enjoys them. No
one on the earth is equal to him in strength and prowess."

Shlok 44: While those demons were thus talking, Ravana who was excited with fury, rushed
towards Seetha, who was present in the Ashoka grove.

Shlok 45: Though being kept back by his companions whose minds were set on his welfare, Ravana
who was very much enraged, rushed like Mars, in the sky, which would rush towards the
constellation, Rohini in fury.

Shlok 46: The faultless Seetha for her part, who was being guarded by female demons, saw the
enraged Ravana who was bearing an excellent sword.

Shlok 47: Seetha was perturbed in seeing him, bearing sword and who was not going back
eventhough being kept back in many ways by his friends.

Shlok 48- 49: Filled with sorrow and lamenting, Seetha said to herself as follows: "From the
manner in which this fellow himself is rushing towards me in fury, I fear the evil-minded demon is
going to kill me, to make me husband-less, even though I have a husband".

Shlok 50- 51: "He incited me several times, devoted as I am to my husband, saying 'Be my
consort!'. He was refused firmly by me. Having been evidently afflicted with despair on my refusing
to wait upon him, he is surely intent to kill me, filled as he was with anger and infatuation."

Shlok 52: "Otherwise, that vulgar demon might have killed those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana,
the foremost of men, today in battle, because of me."

Shlok 53: "Here, I just heard a terrific great noise of a multitude of demons, who have been
jubilant and roaring about a pleasant happening."

Shlok 54: "Alas! Woe is me, if that destruction of the two princes was brought about because
of me. Otherwise, the terrific demon of a sinful resolve, having not been able to kill Rama and
Lakshmana, is going to kill, me, because of the grief over his son's death."

Shlok 55- 56: "Those words of Hanuma were not acted upon by me, having a low mind. If I left on
that day on his back, though not won back by my husband, I would not have grieved like this today,
as I should be resting on the lap of my husband (in that case)."

Shlok 57: "I think that the heart of that Kausalya will get burst, when the lady, who had only
one son, hears of her son having been killed in battle."

Shlok 58: "While lamenting, Kausalya will vividly recall about the birth, childhood, youth,
the righteous acts and the handsome form of the great-souled Rama."

Shlok 59: "Having observed a ceremony in honour of her deceased son and getting despondent and
unconscious, Kausalya will surely enter the flame or be drowned in water."

Shlok 60: "Woe be to the unfaithful hunch-back Manthara, of sinful resolve, on whose
consequence, Kausalya will get this grief."

Shlok 61- 62: Seeing Seetha miserably weeping in that manner like Rohini (the deity presiding over
a constellation of this name), fallen under the sway of the planet Mars, when away of the moon-god
(her husband), a minister called Suparshva, a good-natured, upright and highly intelligent demon,
even though restrained by other ministers, spoke the following words Ravana, the foremost of
demons:

Shlok 63: "O Ravana, the younger brother of Kubera himself! How do you wish to kill Seetha,
abandoning your righteousness, in a bout of anger?"

Shlok 64: "O valiant king of demons! Why are you thinking of destroying a lady, ever since you
completed the vow of celibacy essential for a study of the Vedic lore and were devoted to your own
duty?"

Shlok 65: "O king! Behold at Seetha, endowed, as she is, with beauty. Together with us,
release your anger, in battle, on Rama alone."

Shlok 66: "Making yourself ready today itself, the fourteenth day of the dark half of this
month, you along with the armies, sally forth tomorrow, the moonless day, to victory."

Shlok 67: "As a valiant and shrewd chariot-warrior, fighting with a sword, in the foremost of
your chariots, you can fetch Seetha by killing Rama, the son of Dasaratha."

Shlok 68: Accepting that advice, endowed with justice, tendered by a friend, the evil-minded
Ravana went to his palace. Thereafter, that valiant Ravana, along with his friends, again went to
his assembly hall from there.



SARGA 93
------------------------------

[Text] As per Ravana's command, his army marches forward to the battle-field, so as to
fight fiercely with Rama and his army with their weapon. When the demons attack the monkeys with
their various weapons fiercely, they seek refuge in Rama. Rama destroys the troops of demons in the
battle-field swiftly.

Shlok 1: That king, who was dejected and very much distressed, having entered the
ssembly-hall, sat on his pre-eminent seat, snorting like a lion.

Shlok 2: That mighty Ravana, who was emaciated for his son's death, having joined both his
palms in salutation, spoke the following words all those chiefs of army:

Shlok 3: "Surrounded by the entire elephants and horses, as also graced with columns of
chariots and foot-soldiers, all of you march forward."

Shlok 4: "Encircling Rama alone, you have to kill him, by showering streams of arrows upon
him, even as clouds pour showers during the rainy season."

Shlok 5: "Or I shall kill Rama, while the world is witnessing it tomorrow, once his limbs are
torn by you with your sharp arrows in the great battle."

Shlok 6: Having heard those words of Ravana, those demons sallied forth for the battle, along
with various kinds of armies and speedy chariots.

Shlok 7: All those demons hurled iron clubs, sharp-edged spikes, arrows, swords and axes
capable of destroying the life. The monkeys too hurled trees and mountains towards the demons.

Shlok 8: Towards sun-rise, that very terrific battle became tumultuous between demons and
monkeys.

Shlok 9: Those monkeys and demons then began to strike each other with multi-coloured maces,
darts, swords and axes in the battle.

Shlok 10: While the battle was thus in progress, the surprisingly enormous dust was actually
settled down by the streams of blood, proceeding from the demons and mokeys.

Shlok 11: With elephants and chariots as their river-banks, with horses as their fish and with
flag-staffs as trees, rivers of blood gushed forth, carrying dead

Shlok 12- 13: Then, all those monkeys were drenched in streams of blood. Leaping and bouncing on
the battle-field, the monkey-chiefs broke off flag-staffs, armours, chariots, horses and various
kinds of weapons.

Shlok 14: With their sharp teeth and nails, the monkeys tore off the hair, ears, eye-brows and
noses of the demons.

Shlok 15: A hundred monkey-chiefs rushed towards each single demon in the battle, even as
birds would rush towards a tree laden with fruits.

Shlok 16: Then, the demons resembling mountain in size, struck down the terrific monkeys with
large maces, darts, swords and axes.

Shlok 17: The huge army of monkeys, being struck down by the demons, sought refuge in Rama,
the son of Dasaratha, who affords protection.

Shlok 18: Thereupon, Rama of great splendour and prowess, taking up his bow and entering the
army of demons, streamed forth showers of arrows.

Shlok 19: Those highly terrific demons dared not approach Rama, having entered their ranks,
was scorching them with the flame of his arrows, even as clouds would not approach the scorching
sun in the sky.

Shlok 20: Those demons saw the most terrible deeds only of Rama, when they were actually
performed by him in the battle-field, which were difficult to perform for others.

Shlok 21: Those demons could not actually see Rama, whle he was shaking their huge army and
blowing away their great chariots, any more than one could see a gale of wind in a forest.

Shlok 22: They saw the army torn and pierced with arrows, as also scorched, broken down and
tormented with missiles. They could not see Rama, who was so swift in his martial art.

Shlok 23: The demons could not behold Rama hitting their bodies, even as created beings are
not able to see their individual souls resting in their sense-objects.

Shlok 24- 25: "Here is Rama, killing the army of elephants. Here is Rama, destroying great
chariot-warriors. Here is Rama, killing foot-soldiers along with horses with his sharp arrows".
Saying so, all those demons struck one another with rage in the battle-field those who were in
similarity of appearance to Rama.

Shlok 26: Having been thrown into confusion by the great mystic missile presided over by the
Gandharvas, the celestial musicians; presided over by the Gandharvas, the celestial musicians;
those demons were unable to see Rama, even when he was scorching away their army.

Shlok 27: Those demons for their part saw thousands of Rama's in the battle-field, while at
other times, they saw only one Rama in that great battle.

Shlok 28: Those demons for their part saw thousands of Ramas in the battle-field; while at
other times, they saw only one Rama in that great battle.

Shlok 29- 30: The created beings saw that Rama in the form of a discus, which was killing the
demons on the battle-field, like the "Wheel of Time", for its flame, the arrows for its spokes, his
bow for the felly of the wheel, the twanging of the bow-string and the clanging of the gauntlet for
the sound produced for its revolution, his energy and the virtues for its radiance and the power of
his mystic missiles for its edge.

Shlok 30- 31- 32: Within a matter of three hours, with his arrows looking like tongues of flames, Rama
killed an army of demons, capable of changing their form at will, including ten thousands chariots
possessing the swiftness of the wind, eighteen thousand strong elephants, fourteen thousand horses
with their riders and a full two lacs of demons fighting on foot.

Shlok 34: Those surviving demons, with their horses killed, with their chariots destroyed,
with thier flag-staffs broken and with broken spirits, rushed back towards the City of Lanka.

Shlok 35: That battle-field, with elephants, foot-soldiers and horses killed, looked like a
pleasure-grave of the powerful and the enraged the lord of destruction.

Shlok 36: Then, the celestials along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, holy saints and
great sages acclaimed that feat of Rama, saying "well done, well done!".

Shlok 37- 38: Then, the virtuous Rama spoke also to Sugreeva, Vibhishana, Hanuma the monkey,
Jambavan, Mainda the foremost of monkeys and even Dvivida, who were in close proximity to him as
follows "Such wonderful power of this missile exists either with me or with the three-eyed Rudra
the lord of destruction."

Shlok 39: Rama, a compeer of Indra the lord of celestials, the great souled, unwearied in the
use of weapons and missiles, having destroyed that army of demons, was applauded by the rejoiced
troops of celestials.



SARGA 94
------------------------------

[Text] The female-demons lament over the death of their husbands and kinsfolk in battle.
They further rebuke Surpanakha, for being the prime cause to bring Seetha to Lanka forcibly by
Ravana and for all the combat occurring with Rama thereafter. The female-demons feel sad that
Ravana did not heed to the appropriate advice given by Vibhishana. They further lament on
perceiving bad omens and predict the annihilation of Ravana. They recollect an instance of
celestials praying for Shiva and getting a boon that a woman (Seetha) will be born to cause the
destruction of demons.

Shlok 1- 2- 3: Rama, who was unweary in action, with his shining arrows adorned with pure gold,
killed those thousands of elephants dispatched by Ravana, thousands of horses, valiant demons who
can change their form at will mounted on thousands of chariots with their flag-staffs, having the
colour of fire, fighting with maces and iron rods and conspicuous with their golden banners.

Shlok 4- 5: Seeing and hearing about the killing of the demons, the surviving demons well
frightened, looked sad and were overwhelmed with anxiety. They wailed when they met their wives.
All female-demons who lost their husbands, sons and kinsfolk met at one place, stricken as they
were with sorrow, wailed as follows:

Shlok 6: "How did the old and ugly Surpanakha, of sunken belly, approach, in the forest, Rama
who is charming like the god of love?"

Shlok 7: "How strange that on seeing that Rama of tender youth, endowed with extraordinary
strength and devoted to the welfare of all created beings, that ugly woman (Surpanakha) who
deserved to be condemned by the people, was stung with excessive lust?"

Shlok 8: "How that ugly-faced demoness, who is bereft of all virtues, dared to make love to
Rama, who is full of virtues, endowed with great bodily strength and who possessed a charming
countenance?"

Shlok 9- 10: "Because of the ill-luck of these people, and to the destruction of demons and of
Dushana and Khara, that grey-haired and disgusting woman, who had developed wrinkles, tried to be
arrogant with Rama, misdeed which was worth ridiculing and condemned by the whole world."

Shlok 11: "For the sake of that Surpanakha, Ravana built this huge enmity. For his own
destruction, Ravana the demon brought that Seetha."

Shlok 12: "Ravana cannot obtain Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, but an endless enmity has been
built with the mighty Rama."

Shlok 13: "Seeing that instance of Rama killing single-handedly Viradha the demon, who was
yearning for Seetha, is enough indeed (to convince Ravana of Rama's strength and ability)"

Shlok 14: "In Janasthana, Rama killed fourteen thousand demons who were doing terrific feats,
with his arrows resembling tongues of fire."

Shlok 15: "In that battle, Khara, Dushana and Trishira were killed with arrows resembling the
sun. That instance should have been sufficient (to open the eyes of Ravana)."

Shlok 16: "Further, that Kabandha having arms with a length of eight miles each, with blood as
his food and roaring with anger was killed. That instance should have been sufficient."

Shlok 17: "Rama killed the mighty Vali, the son of Indra the lord of celestials, looking like
the black cloud. That instance should have been sufficient. (To open the eyes of Ravana)"

Shlok 18: "The kingdom was restored to the miserable Sugreeva, who was residing in Mount
Rishyamuka, living with his wishes disappointed. That instance should prove sufficient. (To open
the eyes of Ravana)."

Shlok 19: "The appropriate advice tendered by Vibhishana which was conformable to duty and
interest of Ravana as also beneficial to all the demons, was not to the liking to him, due to his
ignorance."

Shlok 20: "Had Ravana followed Vibhishana's advice, this Lanka would not have become a burial
ground, tormented by sorrow."

Shlok 21: "Ravana is not able to learn a lesson, even after hearing that the mighty
Kumbhakarna was killed by Rama and that unconquerable colossal-bodied Indrajit, his beloved son was
killed by Lakshmana."

Shlok 22: "Ravana is not able to learn a lesson, even after hearing that the mighty
Kumbhakarna was killed by Rama and that the unconquerable colossal-bodied Indrajit, his beloved son
was killed by Lakshmana."

Shlok 23: "The valiant Rama killed hundreds and thousands of chariots, horses and elephants in
the battle. He killed even the foot soldiers too."

Shlok 24: "Rama, coming in the form of either Rudra the lord of destruction or Vishnu, the
lord of preservation, or Indra the lord of celestials who performed one hundred ritual sacrifices,
or otherwise Yama, the Lord of Death himself, is killing us."

Shlok 25: "As Rama killed all our great warriors, we are lamenting with a loss of hope in our
lives, failing to see an end to our fear and having become helpless."

Shlok 26: "The valiant Ravana, having been gifted with great boons by Brahma, is not able to
understand this greatly terrific calamity, coming forth from the hand of Rama."

Shlok 27: "Neither the celestials nor Gandharvas the celestial musicians nor the evil spirits
nor the demons are able to protect Ravana, who is about to attack Rama in battle."

Shlok 28: "Bad omens are appearing for Ravana, as and when his warriors are setting out for
each combat. They are indeed telling about the prospective annihilation of Ravana by Rama."

Shlok 29: Brahma, the lord of creation, gratified by the austerity of Ravana, gave protection
to Ravana from celestials, demons and ogres. But Ravana did not seek protection from human
beings."

Shlok 30: "I think that such a calamity has come from that humanity only dreadfully causing an
end to the lives for the demons and for Ravana too. There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 31: "The celestials, tormented by the mighty Ravana, because of the misuse of the boon
bestowed on him, worshipped Brahma the lord of creation with their glowing austerities."

Shlok 32: "The great-souled Brahma, duly gratified, spoke for the benefit of those celestials,
the following words to them:

Shlok 33: "From today onwards, all the ogres and demons, constantly enveloped with fear, will
be wandering always in the three worlds."

Shlok 34: "All the celestials together with Indra and others, got propitiated by Shiva the
lord of destruction, with the ensign of a bull on his flag-staff and who destroyed the three strong
cities built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth for demons."

Shlok 35: "The gracious Shiva spoke the following words to the celestials: 'For your benefit,
a woman will be born, for causing destruction of the demons.'"

Shlok 36: "This Seetha, the destroyer of demons, employed by the celestials, will consume us
along with Ravana, as in the past hunger consumed the demons."

Shlok 37: "As a result of the bad behaviour of Ravana, the wicked demon with an evil
disposition of mind, this terrific havoc with grief occurred."

Shlok 38: "Rama is occupying us, as the Death occupies at the time of dissolution of the
universe. We do not find any one now, who can give protection to us in this world."

Shlok 39: "There is no refuge whatsoever for us, who stand in great danger, as indeed there is
no shelter for female-elephants, enveloped by a wild fire in a forest."

Shlok 40: "The great-souled Vibhishana did something opportune. He sought refuge in him alone
from whom such a peril is perceived."

Shlok 41: Then, all female-demons, embracing each other in their arms, afflicted as they were
with grief and tormented with excessive fear, lamented thus and wept loudly and severely.



SARGA 95
------------------------------

[Text] On beholding the sight of female-demons, afflicted with grief in the houses of
Lanka, Ravana is very much enraged and orders his generals to tell their armies to set out for the
battle immediately. Ravana promises them to take revenge by killing Rama and Lakshmana as also
monkey-chiefs in the battle. Accompanied by several demon-warriors, Ravana marched to the
battle-field, where Rama and Lakshmana are while Ravana is sallying forth for the battle, he sees
several bad omens presaging his death. On hearing the noise of the demons entering the
battle-field, the army of monkeys return to the battle. A tumultuous fight ensues, between the
monkeys and the demons. Ravana fights fiercely with monkeys.

Shlok 1: Ravana for his part heard the mournful and plaintive cry of the afflicted
female-demons in every house at Lanka.

Shlok 2: Sighing for a long time and remaining engrossed in reflection for a while, that
Ravana was very much enraged and assumed a frightful appearance.

Shlok 3: Nipping his lips with his teeth, his eyes becoming blood-red with anger, and his
sight becoming difficult to endure even for the demons, Ravana looked like the augmented fire of
dissolution.

Shlok 4- 5: Ravana, in words indistinct with anger as though consuming them with his glance,
ordered the demons, standing there near him, viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demon
(as follows): "Tell the armies asking them to start immediately, as per my command."

Shlok 6: Hearing that command of Ravana, those demons were tormented with fear and enjoined
those armies of demons, who felt unagitated, in accordance with the orders of the king.

Shlok 7: Saying, 'so it be', all those demons of terrible aspect, praying for the blessing of
the Almighty for averting evil, sallied forth, with their faces turned towards the
battle-field.

Shlok 8: Paying reverence to Ravana according to the rules of propriety, all those great
car-warriors stood with joined palms, wishing victory to their lord.

Shlok 9: Laughing heartily, Ravana then, stupefied as he was with anger, spoke to those
demons viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demons as follows:

Shlok 10: "Today, I will send Rama and Lakshmana to the abode of Death, with my arrows looking
similar to the sun at the time of dissolution of the Universe."

Shlok 11: "By killing the enemies now, I will take vengeance for Khara, Kumbhakarna, Prahasta
and Indrajit."

Shlok 12: "The sky overcast by my arrows, like clouds, will not be distinctly seen. Neither
the quarters, nor the heaven, nor the seas will come to view."

Shlok 13: "With a multitude of plumed arrows joined with my bow, I will kill, by turns, the
troops of monkey-chiefs today."

Shlok 14: "By mounting on a chariot, having a speed equal to that of wind, I will destroy
today the armies of monkeys, with waves of arrows arising out of the ocean of my bow.

Shlok 15: "Like an elephant, today I will destroy ponds in the form of troops of monkeys
shining like the filaments of lotus, with their faces resembling full-blown lotuses."

Shlok 16: "With their faces transfixed with arrows, the monkey-leaders, lying on the
battle-field today will adorn the earth as with lotuses together with the stalks."

Shlok 17: "With each arrow released in battle today, I shall tear one hundred full of monkeys,
the most furious of their troop, fighting with trees."

Shlok 18: "By killing the enemy today, I shall wipe off the tears of those demons, who lost
their brothers and sons."

Shlok 19: "With the monkeys pierced with my arrows, lying scattered in the battle-field and
bereft of their lives today, I shall cover the earth so fully, that it would be possible to see its
surface only with effort."

Shlok 20: "Today, I shall satiate the crows, vultures and all those other creatures which eat
the flesh, with the flesh of enemies, struck by my arrows."

Shlok 21: "Arrange my chariot quickly. Bring my bow swiftly. Let all the remaining demons
here, follow me to the combat."

Shlok 22: Hearing that command of Ravana, Mahaparshva ordered the army-chiefs, standing there,
as follows: "let the army be made ready quickly."

Shlok 23: Going around the city of Lanka, the army-chiefs for their part, with quick
resolution, joined hand in hand and hastened the demons in every house to set out for the
battle.

Shlok 24-26: The demons, of terrible aspect and having awful faces, then roaring, with their arms
equipped with various weapons viz. swords, sharp-edged darts, pikes, maces, clubs, plough-like
weapons, sharp-edged javelins, huge Kutas and Mudgara, staffs, discuses of every kind, sharpened
axes, slings for throwing stones, stones or cylindrical wooden pieces with iron pikes and other
excellent weapons, rushed out within a moment.

Shlok 27: Then, as per the orders of Ravana, the army-commander hurriedly brought a chariot,
moving swiftly, along with a charioteer and yoked with eight horses. Thereupon, the awful Ravana
mounted that chariot, shining with his own splendour.

Shlok 28: Then, surrounded by several demons, Ravana sallied forth quickly, as though he was
cracking the earth with a profundity of his strength.

Shlok 29: Thereupon, a great noise emanated on all sides from tabors, drums, Kettle-drums and
counches along with the clamour of the demons.

Shlok 30- 31: A clamour was heard, saying "There comes the ruler of demons, the abductor of
Seetha, the destroyer of Brahmanas, the enemy of gods, notorious for his bad conduct, accompanied
by his canopy and pair of whisks, to fight with Rama, the foremost among the Raghu dynasty."

Shlok 32: By that huge sound, the earth trembled. Hearing that sound suddenly, the monkeys ran
away in fear.

Shlok 33: The long-armed Ravana, for his part, with extra-ordinary energy, surrounded by his
ministers, turned up for victory in quest of victory.

Shlok 34: Mahaparshva and Mahodara as also Virupaksha, who was difficult to overpower, as
order by Ravana, then ascended their chariots.

Shlok 35: Those demons, roaring elatedly, as though cracking the earth, and emitting an awfull
uproar, sallied forth, longing for victory.

Shlok 36: Then, the powerful Ravana, resembling the all-destroying Time in the form of Yama,
along with his army-troops of demons, set out for the battle with his raised bow.

Shlok 37: Then, that Ravana, the great chariot-warrior, ascending his chariot driven by swift
horses, sallied forth to the gate, where Rama and Lakshmana were.

Shlok 38: Then, the sun lost its radiance. The quarters too were enveloped in darkness. The
birds emitted fearful notes. The earth too trembled violently.

Shlok 39: The cloud rained blood. The horses stumbled. A vulture descended on the top of the
ensign. Jackals emitted sinister howls.

Shlok 40: His left eye too throbbed. His left arm trembled. He became pale-faced. His voice
was a little lowered.

Shlok 41: When Ravana the demon was sallying forth for the battle, the following evil
phenomena, predicting his death, appeared in the battle-field.

Shlok 42: A meteor with a sound similar to a thunder, fell down from the sky. Ill-omened
vultures together with crows cried out aloud.

Shlok 43: Ignoring these dreadful bad omens due to his ignorance, Ravana marched forward for
the purpose of the massacre in battle, driven as he was by fate.

Shlok 44: On hearing the sound of the chariot of those mighty demons, that army of monkeys too
returned for the fight.

Shlok 45: A tumultuous battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were fond of
victory and summoning each other for combat with rage.

Shlok 46: Thereupon, the enraged Ravana, with his arrows decked with that army of monkeys.

Shlok 47: Some monkeys had their heads chopped off by Ravana. Some had their hearts pierced.
Some were made deprived of their ears.

Shlok 48: Some were struck down breathless. Some were torn in their ribs. Some had their
skulls smashed. Some were deprived of their eyes.

Shlok 49: Whichever side Ravana was coming in his chariot on the battle-field, his eyes
rolling in anger, those monkey-warriors, on that side, could not with stand the rapidity of his
arrows.



SARGA 96

[Text] Having destroyed some monkeys in the battle-field, Ravana tries to approach Rama to
continue his fight. Meanwhile, Sugreeva along with some monkeys attack some chiefs of demons and
destroy them. Then, Virupaksha a demon comes and attacks Sugreeva. Sugreeva brings down a violent
slap on the temple-bone of Virupaksha and kills him.

Shlok 1: The battle-field there, on its part, was strewn on that occasion with those monkeys
whose bodies had thus been torn asunder by Ravana with his arrows.

Shlok 2: Those monkeys could not bear that irresistible descent of arrows loosed by Ravana,
any more than moths would bear a blazing fire.

Shlok 3: Those monkeys tormented by sharp arrows, fled away roaring, as elephants run away,
when enveloped in flames of fire and getting scorched by them.

Shlok 4: Ravana was marching forward swiftly in that battle-field, blowing away the army of
monkeys, like the wind blows away large clouds.

Shlok 5: Having brought about with his might the destruction of those monkeys in battle,
Ravana quickly approached Rama on the battle-field.

Shlok 6: Seeing those monkeys running away in defeat in that battle, Sugreeva kept Sushena in
charge of his army and quickly threw his mind into the fight.

Shlok 7: Keeping that Sushena who was equal to himself, his substitute, that Sugreeva, armed
with the tree as a weapon, marched forward towards the enemy.

Shlok 8: Taking huge rocks and various kinds of trees, all the monkey-warriors followed
Sugreeva at his side and behind.

Shlok 9: The gigantic Sugreeva roared at a high pitch in the battle-field. Striking with his
blows, he crushed various other chiefs of demons.

Shlok 10: The colossal bodied Sugreeva smashed the demons, as the grown-up trees are smashed
by the wind at the time of dissolution of the world.

Shlok 11: Sugreeva rained a hail of rocks on the army of demons, as a cloud rains a shower of
hail-stones on a host of birds in a forest.

Shlok 12-14: While those demons, thus defeated by Sugreeva, falling on the floor and then
roaring, get diminished in number from all sides, the indomitable Virupaksha the demon, holding a
bow, pronouncing his name by himself, descended from his chariot and mounted the back of an
elephant.

Shlok 15: That mighty Virupaksha, mounting that elephant, then roared a terrific noise and
rushed towards the monkeys.

Shlok 16: Virupaksha released dreadful arrows on Sugreeva who was at the front-rank of the
army. He strengthened his support to the worried demons, by cheering them up.

Shlok 17: Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, when he was struck severely with sharp arrows by that
demon, shouted loudly. With profuse anger, he set his mind on killing him.

Shlok 18: Uplifting a tree and coming near that huge elephant, the valiant Sugreeva, a
thorough fighter, struck it on its face.

Shlok 19: That huge elephant, struck with the blow of Sugreeva, receded to a distance of four
yards, sank down and roared too.

Shlok 20- 21: Descending quickly from his wounded elephant, that valiant demon then seizing hold
of his sword from a shield made of a bull's hide and advancing in rapid paces, facing towards
Sugreeva his enemy, approached him, who stood firm, threatening him as it were.

Shlok 22: Taking a huge rock, which looked like a cloud, that Sugreeva, who felt enraged,
threw it on Virupaksha.

Shlok 23: Seeing that rock falling, that highly valiant and excellent of demons then receding
away, struck him with a sword.

Shlok 24: Wounded by the blow of the sword of that strong demon, Sugreeva became as though
unconscious on the ground, for a moment.

Shlok 25: Then, bouncing up suddenly in that great battle, Sugreeva, tightening his fist,
brought it down on the demon's chest violently.

Shlok 26: Feeling enraged, when struck by the blow of that fist, Virupaksha the demon brought
down the armour of Sugreeva by his sword at the battle-front. Thus struck by him, Sugreeva fell
down from his feet.

Shlok 27: Getting up when fallen, Sugreeva gave him a slap, which produced a terrific sound
similar to a thunder.

Shlok 28: Setting himself free from that slap, which was about to be raised by Sugreeva
skillfully, Virupaksha the demon struck Sugreeva on the chest with his fist.

Shlok 29: Then, seeing that demon escaping his blow, Sugreeva the monkey-king for his part,
very much enraged.

Shlok 30: That monkey saw an opportunity to strike that Virupaksha. Then, with anger, Sugreeva
brought down another violent slap on his temple-bone.

Shlok 31- 32: Virupaksha, struck by the blow of that palm, which was like the thunderbolt to the
ground, oozing blood profusely from the (nine) apertures* of his body, as water flows from the
spring.

[Commentary] * Nine apertures of body are two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, penis and
anus.

Shlok 33: The monkeys saw Virupaksha, bathed in foaming blood, with his eyes rolling through
anger and as such rendered all the more deformed.*

[Commentary] * There is a pun here on the word 'Virupaksha' which means one with deformed
eyes.

Shlok 34: The monkeys saw their enemy, bathed in blood, turning to and from as also throbbing
on his sides and roaring piteously.

Shlok 35: Confronting together in the battle-field in that way, those two violent and terrific
armies which were extensive as oceans, of monkeys and demons, roared like two large oceans which
had burst their bounds.

Shlok 36: Beholding that mighty Virupaksha killed by Sugreeva, the army of monkeys and demons
together looked like the agitated river of Ganga.



SARGA 97
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana sends Mahodara to the battle-field. Mahodara creates havoc, by cutting off
the hands, feet and thighs of monkeys. Some monkeys seek refuge with Sugreeva and some ran away for
life. Sugreeva attacks Mahodara and initially kills the horses of the latter. Both of them fight
till the weapons in their hands get broken. Then, they start wrestling with each other, till they
get exhausted. Finally, Sugreeva cuts off Mahodara's head with a huge sword.

Shlok 1: Being killed by each other in that major battle, those two armies were very much
diminished soon, like two lakes in a severe summer.

Shlok 2: Ravana the lord of demons got doubly enraged because of the destroyal of his own
army and the fall of Virupaksha.

Shlok 3: He felt restless to find his own army diminished while being killed by the monkeys
and to see the reversal of his fate.

Shlok 4: He spoke to Mahodara, the annihilator of enemies, standing beside him (as follows):
"O the long-armed! At this juncture, my hope for victory is centered in you."

Shlok 5: "O the brave demon! Destroy the army of our enemies. Show your prowess now. This is
the time to repay the debt of your master (received in the form of sustenance from him). Fight
well."

Shlok 6: Hearing the words of Ravana, Mahodara the chief of demons saying "So it be",
penetrated into the army of enemies, as a moth rushed into a flame.

Shlok 7: Emboldened by the words of his master, that mighty demon, with full of energy,
destroyed the monkeys by dint of his own valour.

Shlok 8: Taking hold of huge rocks and penetrating the terrific army of enemies, those highly
strong monkeys too started killing all the demons.

Shlok 9: In that great battle, the highly enraged Mahodara, with his arrows decked in gold,
chopped off the hands, feet and thighs of monkeys.

Shlok 10: Then, among all those monkeys who were tormented by the demons, some ran away into
ten directions. Some others sought refuge with Sugreeva.

Shlok 11: Seeing the large army of monkeys defeated in the battle, Sugreeva rushed towards
Mahodara who was immediately close to him.

Shlok 12: Seizing hold of a large and terrific rock, which looked like a mountain, Sugreeva
who was endowed with a great energy, hurled it with an aim to kill the demon.

Shlok 13: Seeing that rock falling suddenly, Mahodara, then unagitated, tore it with his
arrows, though it was difficult to approach.

Shlok 14: That rock, broken to a thousand pieces by that demon with a multitude of his arrows,
forthwith fell down on earth, like a flock of frightened vultures.

Shlok 15: Filled with rage on seeing that rock broken and uprooting a Sala tree, Sugreeva
hurled it at his enemy and Mahodara chopped it off into many pieces.

Shlok 16: The valiant Mahodara, who was the tormentator of hostile forces, lacerated Sugreeva
with his arrows. That enraged Sugreeva then saw an iron rod on the ground.

Shlok 17: Swinging that flashing iron rod and showing it to him, Sugreeva killed the excellent
horses of Mahodara with that iron rod of terrible speed.

Shlok 18: Jumping down from that huge chariot, whose horses had been killed, that valiant
Mahodara the demon, thereupon seized hold of a mace with anger.

Shlok 19: With a mace and an iron road respectively in their hands and roaring like two bulls
and resembling like two clouds charged with lightning, those two heroes closed in for a battle.

Shlok 20: Mahodara the demon was angry with Sgureeva and thereupon hurled his blazing mace,
which shone like the sun, on Sugreeva.

Shlok 21- 22: Seeing that highly terrible mace, falling on him in that great battle, the mighty
Sugreeva, the King of monkeys, was enraged with red eyes and struck that mace, by lifting up the
iron rod. That iron rod broke off and fell on the ground.

Shlok 23: Thereupon, the spirited Sugreeva took hold of a formidable steel club, entirely
decked with gold, from the earth-surface.

Shlok 24: Lifting that steel club, Sugreeva hurled it. Mahodara too hurled another mace on
him. Those two weapons, clashing each other, broke and fell on the floor.

Shlok 25: As all their weapons were broken, those two warriors, who were endowed with spirit
and strength, resembling two blazing fires, started contending with fists.

Shlok 26: Roaring again and again, those two warriors then banged each other. Slapping each
other with their palms, they rolled on the earth's surface.

Shlok 27: They raised quickly on their feet and then began to strike each other. Remaining
unyielded, the two heroes pushed each other on their shoulders.

Shlok 28: Those two heroes, the annihilators their enemies, felt exhausted in the course of
their wrestling. Then the highly fast Mahodara the demon took hold of a sword and a shield, lying
not very far.

Shlok 29: In the same way, the highly swift Sugreeva the foremost of monkeys took hold of a
large sword together with a shield, lying there.

Shlok 30: Thereupon, those two warriors, who were skilled in the use of weaponry in the
battle-field and whose limbs were seized with anger, galloped forward, roaring with joy, with their
swords upraised.

Shlok 31: With their thoughts concentrated on one point of victory, both the warriors were
enraged with each other and performed circumambulations form left to right, very quickly.

Shlok 32: That valiant and evil-minded Mahodara, who was boasting of his own prowess, let fall
with very high speed, that sword on the heavy shield of Sugreeva.

Shlok 33: Even while Mahodara was extracting his sword which had got struck in the shield,
Sugreeva severed with his own sword, Mahodara's head, which was adorned with ear-rings and
helmet.

Shlok 34: While Mahodara, with his head chopped off, was falling on the ground, Ravana's army,
on seeing it, could no longer be seen on the battle-field.

Shlok 35: Having killed Mahodara, Sugreeva made a rejoicing roar with his monkeys. Ravana was
enraged. Rama looked rejoicing.

Shlok 36: With their faces looking low-spirited all the demons felt dejected. With their minds
stricken with fear, all of them ran away from the battle-field.

Shlok 37: Having thrown down to the ground that Mahodara, looking like a part of a huge
mountain lying shattered the invincible Sugreeva shone in glory in the battle-field like the sun
shines with its rays.

Shlok 38: Having attained victory in the battle-front, Sugreeva then continued to be looked at
by the multitude of gods, Siddhas (a class of demigods who are endowed with mystic powers) and
Yakshas (another class of demigods attending on Kubera, the god of riches) as also a host of beings
standing on the earth's surface who were all overwhelmed with joy.



SARGA 98
------------------------------

[Text] When Mahaparshva enters the battle-field and torments the monkeys, Angada comes to
their rescue and hits him. Jambavan also enters the field and breaks the chariot and the horses of
Mahaparshva. Then, Angada knocks the bow and the helmet of Mahaparshva, as they fall down. Finally,
Mahaparshva falls dead, succumbing to a forcible blow of Angada's fist.

Shlok 1: Seeing Mahodara killed by Sugreeva, the mighty Mahaparsva for his part with his
red-blood eyes through anger, forthwith stirred up the terrific army of Angada with his arrows.

Shlok 2: That demon struck down the heads of monkey-chiefs from their trunks, as wind would
throw down a fruit from its stalk.

Shlok 3: Moreover, that demon very quickly chopped off the arms of some monkeys with his
arrows and struck down the region of the ribs of others.

Shlok 4: Tormented by the flight of arrows of Mahaparshva, all those monkeys were downcast
with despair and lost heart.

Shlok 5: Seeing his army depressed on being tormented by the demon, Angada who was endowed
with a great impetuosity, exhibited his tempo like an ocean on full-moon days.

Shlok 6: Taking hold of a steel rod, with its radiance equal to that of the sun, hurled it on
Mahaparshva in that combat.

Shlok 7: By that blow, that Mahaparsva dropped senseless and unconscious on the ground from
his chariot along with is charioteer

Shlok 8- 9: The energetic Jambavan, looking like a heap of black collyrium, who was exceedingly
powerful, battalion which resembled a black cloud a mountain-peak, killed his horses with his
strength and broke that chariot too.

Shlok 10: Regaining his consciousness within a while, the mighty Mahaparshva again struck
Angada with his many arrows.

Shlok 11: He struck Jambavan, the king of bears with three arrows in his chest and struck
Gavaksha too with many arrows.

Shlok 12: Seeing Gavaksha and Jambavan tormented by the arrows, that Angada was infatuated
with anger and seized hold of a terrific iron rod.

Shlok 13- 14: Firmly holding that iron rod, which shone like the rays of the sun, with both hands
and turning it around with force, Angada son of Vali, his eyes red with anger, hurled it on that
Mahaparshva the demon, who stood at a distance, with an intention to kill him.

Shlok 15: Hurled by the mighty Angada, that iron rod for its part, knocked the bow with the
arrow fitted to it, from the demon's hand and also his helmet.

Shlok 16: Approaching him with speed and with anger, the valiant Angada slapped him on the
temple (root of the ear), shining with an ear-ring.

Shlok 17: Enraged as he was, that Mahaparsva for his part, who was endowed with a great
swiftness and enormous splendour, seized hold of a huge axe in one hand.

Shlok 18: Extremely enraged, the demon hurled that stainless and strong axe, which had been
washed in oil and which was made of steel, on Angada.

Shlok 19: Full of anger, that Angada evaded that axe, which had been aimed by him mostly at
his left shoulder-bone.

Shlok 20: That valiant Angada, with his prowess equal to that of his father, was quite enraged
and firmly tightened his fist resembling a thunder-bolt.

Shlok 21: Knowing the vital parts of the body, Angada pounced his fist, which invaded like a
thunderbolt, on the boson of the demon, in the vicinity of his breasts.

Shlok 22: With the blow of that fist in that great combat, the fleshy part of his heart was
blasted and he fell dead on the ground.

Shlok 23: When Mahaparshva fell dead on the ground, his army got confused. A mammoth anger
arose in Ravana.

Shlok 24- 25: That highly profound lion's roar of the rejoiced monkeys, by its noise, was well
like the loud sound of the gods along with Indra the lord celestials, nay, by its vibrations
breaking asunder as it were the City of Lanka with its attics and town-gates.

Shlok 26: Hearing the loud noise of monkeys, as also of the celestials in the battle-field,
the enraged Ravana the adversary of Indra, then stood prepared for a battle again.



SARGA 99
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana enters the battle-field and with his mystic missile, frightens several
monkeys and destroys them. Rama and Lakshmana come and attack Ravana. Then, Rama and Ravana fight
each other with various kinds of arrows. When the missile employed by Ravana is struck down by
Rama, all the monkeys shout loudly with a rejoice.

Shlok 1- 2: Seeing Mahodara and Mahaparshva the demons having been killed, and that valiant and
mighty Virupaksha struck down in that great battle, a tremendous anger took possession of Ravana.
He urged on his charioteer and addressed to him the following words:

Shlok 3: "Killing those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, I will remove surely the sorrow
caused to me on account of the ministers who have been killed and the city which has been laid
siege to (by the monkeys)."

Shlok 4- 5: "In the battle, I will cut down the tree in the shape of Rama, which is going to
yield fruit through its flower in the form of Seetha, whose principal branches are Sugreeva,
Jambavan, Kumuda, Nala, Dvivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana, Hanuma, Sushena and all the chiefs
of monkey-warriors."

Shlok 6: Ravana, the mighty and the surpassing Chariot-Warrior, went quickly, making a noise
in all the ten directions, with the sound of the chariot, rushing towards Rama.

Shlok 7: Filled with that sound, the entire earth, with its rivers, mountains and forests,
trembled, throwing lions, antelopes and birds, into fright.

Shlok 8: He employed very highly terrific and exceedingly frightful mystic missile called
Tamasa, which began to consume all the monkeys, who started falling down on all sides.

Shlok 9: Dust began to fly up from the earth, while those frustrated monkeys were fleeing
away for they could no longer bear that missile built by Brahma himself.

Shlok 10: Seeing those hundreds of many of his armies shattered by excellent arrows of Ravana,
Rama took his stand, ready for the battle.

Shlok 11- 12: Having driven away the army of monkeys, Ravana the foremost among the demons then
saw Rama, the annihilator of his enemies, who was endowed with long arms and eyes as wide as lotus
petals standing unconquered with his brother Lakshmana-like Indra the lord of celestials is seen
with Vishnu, the supreme lord of preservation-holding up his great bow as though scraping the
sky.

Shlok 13- 14: Seeing the disappointed monkeys and Ravana advancing, the mighty Rama who was
endowed with a great splendour and accompanied by Lakshmana who were born in Raghu dynasty, then
pleasingly seized his bow at the middle.

Shlok 15: Thereupon, Rama began to stretch his excellent bow, which was endowed with great
force and sonorous, as though he was breaking the earth asunder.

Shlok 16: Then, due to that buzzing sound produced by the streams of Ravana's arrows as also
by the twang of Rama's bow, those demons fell down in their hundreds.

Shlok 17: That Ravana, coming within the range of arrow-shots of Rama and Lakshmana, resembled
Rahu (the demon who is supposed to seize the sun and the moon), standing in the vicinity of the
moon and the sun.

Shlok 18: Wishing to fight him with his sharp arrows at the earliest, Lakshmana stretching his
bow, released his arrows which were like flames of fire.

Shlok 19: Ravana of extra ordinary energy prevented those arrows, the moment they were
released by Lakshmana, with his arrows, in the sky itself.

Shlok 20: Showing the dexterity of his hand, Ravana split the arrows of Lakshmana one with
one, three with three and ten with ten arrows.

Shlok 21: Overpassing Lakshmana, Ravana the victorious in battle, approached Rama, who stood
like another mountain, in the battle-field.

Shlok 22: Having approached Rama, Ravana the lord of demons, having his eyes turning red-blood
through anger, released streams of arrows upon him.

Shlok 23: Just on seeing streams of arrows coming forth, loosed from Ravana's bow, Rama
thereupon quickly seized hold of 'Bhalla'* arrows in haste.

[Commentary] Bhalla - A variety of arrows with a crescent - shaped head.

Shlok 24: Then, Rama tore off that multitude of arrows, which were blazing and looking very
terrific like enraged serpents, with his sharp Bhalla - arrows.

Shlok 25: Rama on Ravana and Ravana on Rama, quickly showered each other with streams of
sharp-pointed arrows of various kinds.

Shlok 26: Pushing back each other with the velocity of their arrows and remaining undefeated,
the two warriors described circles of different kinds each moving from left to right, for a long
time.

Shlok 27: Created beings were frightened, even as both the terrific warriors were fighting all
at once, releasing their arrows at each other, thus resembling the god of retribution and the god
of Death respectively.

Shlok 28: The sky at that time became dense with arrows of various kinds, even as it is
covered, at the end of the monsoon, with clouds crowded with crowns of lightning.

Shlok 29: The sky was studded as with eye-holes, by showers of arrows of high velocity, which
were extremely sharp-pointed and adorned with plumes of vultures and were loosed with high
speed.

Shlok 30: They initially made the sky dark with arrows. Even after the sun-set, they made it
dark, like two huge clouds risen in it.

Shlok 31: A great combat ensued between both of them, who were willing to kill each other.
That battle was unimaginable and unapproachable, like the duel that took place between Vritra the
demon and Indra the lord of celestials.

Shlok 32: Both the warriors were excellent archers. Both were skilled in war-fare. Both were
eminently skilled in the use of missiles. Both moved unhindered in the battle-field.

Shlok 33: In whichever course both of them went, in the same respective direction, streams of
arrows went, like waves in two oceans, whipped by the wind.

Shlok 34: Ravana, having skilful hands and a cause for the cry of the world, released a row of
steel arrows on Rama's forehead.

Shlok 35: Rama endured on his head, that row of steel arrows, having a lustre of black
lotus-petals, discharged from the terrific bow. He did not get perturbed.

Shlok 36: Thereupon, seizing hold of more arrows, reciting sacred incantations and making use
of the missile presided over by Rudra and stretching his bow, the valiant Rama of great splendour
was filled with anger and released those arrows.

Shlok 37: Fallen on the unbreakable armour of Ravana, which looked like a large cloud, those
arrows could not cause any pain to him at that time.

Shlok 38: Rama, who was skilled in the use of all types of mystic missiles, forthwith pierced
in the forehead, yet again by a paramount missile, that Ravana seated in his chariot.

Shlok 39: Having pierced the frames of arrows of Ravana, Rama's arrows penetrated like
five-headed hissing serpents into the earth, when rebuffed by Ravana.

Shlok 40: Striking down Rama's missile, that Ravana, who was stupefied with anger, employed
another exceedingly terrific missile presided over by demoniac forces.

Shlok 41- 42: He released sharp arrows, having the heads of lions and tigers, those of buzzards
and crows, even of vultures and faloons, as well as those of jackals and wolves, arrows with their
mouths wide open, having the heads of venomous snakes with five heads, bringing fear.

Shlok 43- 44: Hissing like a serpent provoked to anger Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary
energy and conjuring tricks, released towards Rama these and other arrows, having the heads of
donkeys, those of boars, dogs and cocks as also of alligators and venomous snakes.

Shlok 45: Possessed by a missile presided over by demoniac forces, that Rama endowed with a
great strength and resembling the god of fire, released a missile presided over by the god of
fire.

Shlok 46: Rama employed there, various kinds of arrows, with heads bright as fire, others with
heads shining like the sun, the moon, the crescent, a comet, others shining like planets, lunar
mansions and a huge meteor and some arrows resembling flashes of lightning.

Shlok 48: Struck by Rama's missile, the terrific arrows of Ravana got destroyed in the sky and
fell down in thousands of pieces.

Shlok 49- 50: Rejoiced to see that missile struck down by Rama, who was unweary in action, all the
valiant monkeys, who were capable of changing their form at will, then encompassing Rama, raised a
clamour, facing Sugreeva.

Shlok 51: Striking down with force that missile which came forth from Ravana's arms, the
great-souled Rama, then was filled with rejoice while the chiefs of monkeys, full f joy, shouted
loudly.

[Text] Rama and Ravana confront each other with various arrows and missiles. Meanwhile,
Lakshmana joins the fight and chops off Ravana's bow with his arrows. Vibhishana also fights and
kills Ravana's horses. Lakshmana rescues Vibhishana, when a spear is hurled on him by Ravana. Then,
Ravana throws a spear on Lakshmana. As it penetrates Lakshmana's bossom, Lakshmana falls down
unconscious. Rama hurls hails of arrows on Ravana from his flaming bow. Ravana takes to his heels
out of fear.

Shlok 1: When that missile was made defunct, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, doubled
his fury and in his anger, began to employ another missile immediately.

Shlok 2: Ravana, who was endowed with extraordinary splendour, started to release another
cruel and terrific missile built by Maya the demon, on Rama.

Shlok 3: Then, from that bow, came forth, blazing pikes, maces and clubs, which were hard as
adamant, on all sides.

Shlok 4: Various kinds of furious mallets, deceptive nooses and blazing thunderbolts came
forth, like piercing gales at the time of the destruction of the world.

Shlok 5: The glorious Rama, the foremost among the knower in the use of excellent missiles
and who was endowed with extra ordinary splendour, struck down that missile with an excellent
missile presided over by Gandharvas the celestial musicians.

Shlok 6: When that missile was made defunct by the great souled Rama, Ravana with his coppery
eyes in anger, employed a missile presided over by the sun-god.

Shlok 7: Then came forth resplendent and large discuses, from the bow of that intelligent
Ravana, of terrific impetuosity.

Shlok 8: Even as they came forth and falling on all sides, the sky was blazing and the
quarters illuminated, as by the moon, the sun and other planets.

Shlok 9: In the forefront of Ravana's army, that Rama split those discuses and other strange
weapons, with a multitude of arrows.

Shlok 10: Seeing that missile struck down, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, pierced
Rama with ten arrows in all his vital parts.

Shlok 11: Eventhough that Ravana struck Rama with those ten arrows released from his great
bow, Rama of extraordinary energy was not shaken.

Shlok 12: Then, Rama the victorious in battle, was quite enraged and struck Ravana in all his
organs with a multitude of arrows.

Shlok 13: In the meantime, the mighty and enraged Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, the
destroyer of valiant enemies, seized hold of seven arrows.

Shlok 14: Lakshmana of great brilliance, with those arrows of high velocity, tore off into
many pieces, the flag-staff of Ravana, which bore the emblem of a man's head.

Shlok 15: The glorious and mighty Lakshmana, with a single arrow, tore the head of Ravana's
charioteer, which was adorned with blazing ear-rings.

Shlok 16: With five sharp arrows, Lakshmana then chopped off Ravana's bow, which looked like
an elephant's trunk.

Shlok 17: Bouncing forward, Vibhishana killed, with his mace, the excellent horses of Ravana,
which looked like black clouds and were tall as mountains.

Shlok 18: Leaping down with speed from his large chariot, whose horses had been killed, Ravana
then exhibited a violent anger towards the younger brother of Rama.

Shlok 19: Then, Ravana, of great energy and prowess, hurled a spear looking like a blazing
thunderbolt, on Vibhishana.

Shlok 20: Even before the spear reached Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it with three of his arrows
and a loud cheer then arose from the monkeys in the battle-field.

Shlok 21: That gold-crowned spear, torn into three pieces, fell like a large meteor with
sparks of fire falling from the sky.

Shlok 22: Thereupon, Ravana took hold of another large most competent spear, which was
difficult to be approached even by Yama the lord of Death and blazing as it was, with its own
splendour.

Shlok 23: The mighty and the evil-minded Ravana swiftly hurled that very great spear, burning
with a radiance similar to that of a blazing thunder-bolt.

Shlok 24: In the meanwhile, the valiant Lakshmana quickly rushed towards that Vibhishana, who
got a danger to his life.

Shlok 25: To rescue that Vibhishana, the heroic Lakshmana, having stretched his bow, threw out
streams of arrows on Ravana who was holding a spear in his hand.

Shlok 26: Poured in with a multitude of arrows discharged by the great-souled Lakshmana,
Ravana with his attach frustrated, did not make up his mind to attack Vibhishana further.

Shlok 27: Seeing Vibhishana his brother rescued by Lakshmana, that Ravana, turning his face
towards Lakshmana spoke the following words:

Shlok 28: "O Lakshmana, exalter of your own strength! As Vibhishana was rescued by you in this
way, this spear, on letting off Vibhishana the demon, is being hurled on you now."

Shlok 29: "This spear, having blood-marks and hurled by bludgeon-like arm, having pierced your
heart, will depart only after taking your life."

Shlok 30- 31: Thus saying, the greatly enraged Ravana roared and hurled towards Lakshmana, that
unfailing spear, which was adorned with eight loudly clamouring bells, which had been designed by
Maya the demon by dint of his conjuring trick, capable of destroying adversaries and blazing as it
was with splendour.

Shlok 32: That spear, with a sound equal to Indra's thunder-bolt, hurled by the terribly swift
Ravana, soon fell with speed on Lakshmana in the battle-front.

Shlok 33: Rama repeatedly uttered to that spear even as it was rushing forth (on Lakshmana) as
follows: "May it be well with Lakshmana! May you prove useless! May your effort be frustrated!"

Shlok 34: That spear, which was looking like a venomous serpent, released by the enraged
Ravana in the battle, quickly penetrated the bosom of Lakshmana, who stood fearless.

Shlok 35: That spear, like the tongue of Vasuki (the lord of serpents), blazing with a great
dazzle, fell on the broad chest of Lakshmana, with enormous speed.

Shlok 36: Penetrated very deeply and pierced through his heart by the spear due to the force
exerted by Ravana, Lakshmana fell to the ground.

Shlok 37: Seeing Lakshmana in that state, Rama, of extraordinary splendour, who was stationed
in the vicinity, became sorrowful at heart because of the love towards his brother.

Shlok 38: Rama, whose eyes were filled with tears, reflected just for a while and then was
very much enraged, like fire at the time of dissolution of the world.

Shlok 39: Becoming aware that it was not the time for feeling despondent, and looking at
Lakshmana, Rama resumed that highly tumultuous battle with a great and whole-hearted endeavour,
determined as he was to destroy Ravana.

Shlok 40: Then, Rama saw Lakshmana, who was struck by the spear in that Great War, bathed as
he was in blood and looking like a mountain with a snake (entering its centre).

Shlok 41- 42: Even with an exertion to pull out that spear hurled by the mighty Ravana, those
foremost of the monkeys could not those foremost of the monkeys could not do it because they were
being tormented by Ravana the foremost of demons with a stream of his arrows.

Shlok 43: Penetrating through Lakshmana's bosom, that spear touched the earth. Seizing hold of
awful spear with his hands, the mighty Rama drew it out and getting enraged, broke it during the
course of the battle.

Shlok 44: While Rama was drawing the spear out; arrow, which pierced his vital organs, were
sunk by the mighty Ravana on all his limbs.

Shlok 45: Ignoring those arrows and having embraced Lakshmana, Rama spoke to Hanuma and
Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, as follows:

Shlok 46- 47: "O the chiefs of monkeys! Remain just encompassing Lakshmana. Let this malicious
Ravana of evil designs be killed. The time to manifest my prowess, which I have been wishing for
long, has come, as for a chataka bird, the site of a cloud would come, as sought by it, at the end
of a hot season."

Shlok 48: "I take this vow in truth before you, at this moment, O monkeys, that without delay,
you will see the world devoid of Ravana or Rama (myself)."

Shlok 49: "I encountered with the loss of sovereignity, the dwelling in the forest, the
wandering around in the woods of Dandaka and the rough treatment of Seetha by the demons."

Shlok 50: "A great and terrible suffering has happened to me and an agony equivalent to hell.
Now, by killing Ravana in battle, I will relieve myself of all that agony."

Shlok 51- 52: "That sinful demon, for whose sake, this army of monkeys has been brought by me,
Sugreeva has been anointed on the throne after killing Vali and for whose sake the ocean has been
crossed and a bridge built on it, has come within the range of my sight in the battle-field
now."

Shlok 53- 54: "This Ravana, having come within the range of my vision, cannot survive, any more
than the one who has come within the range of vision of a snake injecting deadly poison with its
very glance or than a serpent who has come within the range of vision of Garuda, the king of birds
and the enemy of serpents."

Shlok 55: "O the foremost of the monkeys who are so difficult to conquer! Seated on the
mountain-peaks, you witness at ease, this battle between myself and Ravana."

Shlok 56: "Let the three worlds (viz. the earth, heaven and the intermediate region) including
Gandharvas the celestial musicians, the gods, the sages and the celestial bards see today the
Ramahood of Rama during the course of my battle."

Shlok 57: "I shall perform today a feat, which people in the world including all living beings
both mobile and immobile, as also gods, will ever narrate together, describing how the battle
proceeded, as long as the earth is able to support those who occupy it."

Shlok 58: Thus speaking, Rama with an attentive mind in the battle-field, struck Rama with
sharp arrows, decked in pure gold.

Shlok 59: Thereupon, Ravana streamed forth blazing steel arrows and then clubs, as clouds
would stream forth the rains.

Shlok 60: A tumultuous sound arose from the excellent arrows, released by Rama and Ravana, as
they struck each other.

Shlok 61: The arrows of Rama and Ravana, split asunder and scattered off, with their blazing
points, fell from the space on to the surface of the earth.

Shlok 62: The loud sound, produced by the impact of the bow-string on the palms of those two
heroes Rama and Ravana, which struck terror in all the living beings, was felt astonished by the
audience.

Shlok 63: Torn asunder by the streams of a multitude of arrows by the great-souled Rama, who
was armed with a blazing bow, while coming in collusion with him, Ravana took to his heels out of
fear, like a cloud when pushed by a tempest.



SARGA 101
------------------------------

[Text] Rama laments over the uncertain condition of Lakshmana. He calls Sushena, the
monkey-physician. Sushena tests Lakshmana and says he is still alive. Sushena then requests Hanuma
to go all the way to Himalayas and bring the required herbs to treat Lakshmana. Hanuma proceeds to
Mount Mahodara and failing to identify the herbs there, carries the mountain-peak itself and brings
it to Sushena. Lakshmana regains consciousness, after getting treated with that herb by
Sushena.

Shlok 1- 2: Seeing the valiant Lakshmana bathed in a stream of blood, when struck down in battle
with a spear by the mighty Ravana and having given a tumultuous fight, to the evil-minded Ravana,
Rama spoke as follows to Sushena, even while releasing a multitude of arrows (at Ravana).

Shlok 3: "This heroic Lakshmana, falling down on earth yielding to Ravana's prowess, is
wiggling like a serpent, causing an increase in grief to me."

Shlok 4: "My energy to fight is failing, even as I see this valiant Lakshmana, who is dearer
to me than life, bathed in blood, my mind being greatly disturbed."

Shlok 5: "Of what use is life or happiness to me, if this illustrious brother of mine, who is
endowed with auspicious bodily marks and who always speaks highly of war, meets with his
death?"

Shlok 6: "My valour is feeling shy, as it were. My bow seems to fall down from any hand. My
arrows are dropping down. My vision has been overcome with tears."

Shlok 7: "My limbs seem to sink down, like those of men in sleep. I have a serious tension,
growing in me. I even wish to die."

Shlok 8: "My brother has been struck down by the evil-minded Ravana, seriously wounded in his
vital parts, afflicted with agony and groaming."

Shlok 9: Seeing his beloved brother, who was his very life-breath moving outside, Rama was
afflicted with excessive agony and gave himself up to anxiety and grief.

Shlok 10: Seeing Lakshmana his brother lying wounded in the dust of the battle-field, he got
into extreme despondency and lamented (as follows), confused in mind, as he was:

Shlok 11: "O the valiant Lakshmana! Even victory cannot create a pleasure for me. What
pleasure can the moon create for a man who has lost his vision?"

Shlok 12: "What purpose of mine will be served by fighting or eve by life? When this Lakshmana
lies killed in the forefront of battle here, I have no use for the war."

Shlok 13: "In the same way as the very glorious Lakshmana followed me When I was going to the
forest, I too will in the same way follow him to the abode of Yama the lord of Death."

Shlok 14: "The demons, who fight treacherously, created this condition to Lakshmana, who loved
his relatives and who was ardently devoted forever to me."

Shlok 15: "Wives may be obtained ever where. Relatives can be had every where. However, I do
not find a brother, born of the same womb, at such a place whatesoever."

Shlok 16: The monkeys saw that Rama, thus lamenting with his mind reeling and distressed in
grief and pitiably sighing his breath repeatedly.

Shlok 17: "Of what use is the kingdom for me, without Lakshmana, who was difficult to over
power? What can I tell to Sumitra, the mother who was so fond of her son?"

Shlok 18: "I shall not be able to bear the reproach, which will be levelled by Sumitra. What
shall I pay to kausalya the mother or what shall I say to Kaikeya?"

Shlok 19: "What shall I say to Bharata or to the mighty Shatrughna, when they ask me, how I
came back without Lakshmana even though I went to the forest along with him?"

Shlok 20: "It is better to die at this place only, rather than hear the reproaches of one's
own people. What sinful act was done by me in a previous birth due to which my righteous brother
lies killed before me?

Shlok 21: "Alas! O the powerful brother, the best of men! O the foremost among the valiant
men! Why are you going to the other world, deserting me?"

Shlok 22: "O brother! Why don't you talk to me, even though I am lamenting? Rise and see! Why
are you lying down? See me, by opening your own eyes, miserable as I am."

Shlok 23: "O the mighty armed! You have been indeed comforting me, whenever stricken with
grief, I roamed listlessly among mountains and forests or felt low-spirited."

Shlok 24: Comforting Rama, whose mind was full of grief and who was thus lamenting, Sushena,
for his part, addressed the following excellent words:

Shlok 25: "O the excellent among men! Give up this notion, which causes despondency in you,
this anguish which gives rise to grief and is as piercing as arrows, in the forefront of
battle."

Shlok 26: "Lakshmana, the augmenter of prosperity, has not got into death. His countenance is
not changed, nor has it become dark."

Shlok 27: "His face may be seen with a good brightness and very much placid. The palms of his
hands are resembling the petals of a lotus. His eyes too are very bright."

Shlok 28: "O king! The appearance of the dead does not look like this. O hero, the annihilator
of enemies! He is all with his life. Do not worry."

Shlok 29: "The repeatedly beating heart with the signs of breath of Lakshmana, lying on the
earth's surface, fast asleep, with his limbs relaxed are telling it, O the gallant prince!"

Shlok 30: Having addressed the words thus to Rama, the highly learned Sushena spoke the
following words to Hanuma the great monkey, who was standing nearby:

Shlok 31- 32- 33: "Proceeding from this place with full speed, O gentle one!, to the mountain called
Oushadhi (Mahodaya), which was already described to you previously by Jambavan, O brave one! Bring
here for restoring the great-souled and heroic Lakshmana to consciousness, the precious herb
Vishalyakarani (1) by name which was sprung up on its southern peak, Savarnakarnani (2),
Samjivakarani(3) and the precious herb, Samdhanakarani (4)."

[Commentary] (1) Vishalyakarani: A herb credited with the virtue of expelling an arrow /other
weapons from the body, healing the wound and relieving pain. (2) Savarnakarani: Another herb
supposed to possess the property of counteracting the discolouration caused by a wound, burns etc.
and restoring the original colour of the skin. (3) Samjivakarani: Another herb believed to possess
the virtue of bringing back an unconscious person to consciousness. (4) Samdhani: A herb credited
with the property of joining a fractured bone.

Shlok 34: Hearing those words, Hanuma, having sprung to Mount Oushadhi, could not identify
those precious herbs and became thoughtful.

Shlok 35: The following thought arose to that Hanuma, whose strength was unlimited: "I will go
back, taking this mountain-peak itself."

Shlok 36: "By conjecture, I understand that the delightful herb must have sprouted in this
mountain-peak. Sushena indeed has said so."

Shlok 37: "If I go without taking Vishalyakarani, harm may come through passage of time and a
great perplexity may arise."

Shlok 38- 39: Thinking thus, the mighty Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, having gone quickly and
approaching that excellent mountain, taking that mountain-peak with his arms, shaking it violently
for three times and uprooting the mountain-peak, which was endowed with many trees in bloom, lifted
it up, so mighty as he was.

Shlok 40: Taking that mountain-peak, which looked like a dark rainy cloud, that Hanuman jumped
up into the sky.

Shlok 41: Arriving with a great speed, Hanuma putting down the mountain-peak and resting for a
while, spoke the following words to Sushena:

Shlok 42: "O the excellent of monkeys! I have brought the entire mountain-peak, as I could not
identify those herbs."

Shlok 43: Eulogizing Hanuma, who was thus narrating his trip, Sushena, the excellent of
monkeys, pulling out the herbs, took hold off them.

Shlok 44: All those monkey-chiefs and even the gods were surprised to see that most difficult
feat of Hanuma.

Shlok 45: Then, crushign that herb, Sushena the excellent of monkeys, having a great
splendour, administered it through Lakshmana's nose.

Shlok 46: Duly inhaling it well, that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries, having the
spear lodged in his body, raised quickly from the earth's surface rid as he was of the spear and
his pain.

Shlok 47: Seeing that Lakshmana risen from the ground, the mokneys were overjoyed and
applauded Lakshmana, saying, "Excellent, excellent!".

Shlok 48: Rama, the destroyer of enemies, said to Lakshmana, "come, come!" and embraced him
firmly with affection, with his eyes clouded with tears.

Shlok 49: After embracing Lakshmana, Rama then said to him: "Luckily, O valiant one, I see you
here, returned from death."

Shlok 50: "There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If you
have attained demise, tell me what significnace is there for it to me?"

Shlok 51: While the great souled Rama was speaking thus, the exhausted Lakshmana, in a feeble
tone, spoke the following words:

Shlok 52: "Having solemnly taken that pledge (of killing Ravana) before, O brother true to
your promise, you ought not to speak as you have done like a weak and courageless man."

Shlok 53: "There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If you
have attained demise, tell me what significance is there for it to me?"

Shlok 54: "O the faultless one! Getting into homelessness for my sake is not befitting of you.
Fulfill your promise now, by killing Ravana."

Shlok 55: "An enemy who falls victim to your arrows, cannot turn out alive, as a huge elephant
which gets into the path of a roaring lion possessing terrible tusks."

Shlok 56: "I, for my part, wish to see the death of this evil-minded fellow instantly, even
before this sun, having finished his task, does not sink below the horizon."

Shlok 57: "O venerable hero! If you wish to kill Ravana in battle, if you wish to fulfill your
promise and if you feel affectionate towards Seetha, do as I tell you soon and now."



SARGA 102
------------------------------

[Text] The battle between Rama and Ravana starts. Indra sends a chariot, an armour, some
arrows and a powerful spear. A tumultuous and thrilling battle ensues between Rama and Ravana. A
spear hurled by Ravana is thwarted by a powerful spear (sent by Indra) of Rama. Then, Rama strikes
Ravana's horses with arrows. He also pierces the chest region and the forehead of Ravana with his
fierce arrows. Ravana gets severely hurt.

Shlok 1: Hearing those words of Lakshmana, that valiant Rama, the annihilator of his enemies,
taking hold of his bow, fixed an arrow on the bow-string.

Shlok 2: In the forefront of battle, Rama released terrific arrows towards Ravana. Then,
occupying another chariot, Ravana the king of demons rushed towards Rama, even as Rahu the
seizer-demon rushes towards the sun.

Shlok 3: Ravana for his part, standing in his chariot struck Rama with thunderbolt-like
arrows, as a cloud strikes gushes of rain on a huge mountain.

Shlok 4: With an attentive mind, Rama showered golden decked arrows, looking like blazing
flames of fire, on Ravana in the battle-field.

Shlok 5: The gods, celestial musicians and kinnaras the mythical beings thought that the
battle was not equal between Rama standing on the ground and Ravana fighting from a chariot.

Shlok 6: Hearing their nectar-like words, the illustrious Indra, the chief f celestials then
called Matali and spoke as follows:

Shlok 7: "Go quickly with my chariot to Rama, who is standing on the earth. After reaching
the earth, invite him to take his seat in the chariot and carry out a great service to the
gods."

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of Indra, Matali, the charioteer of Indra, offering salutation to
him by bowing his head, spoke then the following words:

Shlok 9: "O Indra! Providing with green horses the excellent chariot, I will proceed then
immediately and perform the duty of a charioteer to Rama."

Shlok 10- 11- 12- 13: Then came the glorious and excellent chariot of Indra, having variegated body decked
in gold, which was fitted with hundreds of tiny bells, with its pole of cat's eye gems shone like
the morning sun, yoked to excellent green horses, having golden chaplets on their heads, having
white whisks, covered with nets of gold, shining like the sun and bearing a flag-staff raised on a
golden bamboo. Ascending the chariot, as enjoined by Indra and descending from paradise, Matali
approached Rama.

Shlok 14: Then Matali, the charioteer of Indra, along with a whip in his hand, stayed in the
chariot itself and joining his palms in salutation, spoke the following words to Rama.

Shlok 15: "Indra has sent this chariot to you for your victory, O the mighty and the glorious
Rama, the destroyer of adversaries!"

Shlok 16: "Here is the great bow belonging to Indra, an armour shining as fire, some arrows as
bright as sun and a stainless auspicious spear."

Shlok 17: "O heroic king! Mounting this chariot with me as a charioteer, kill Ravana the king,
as earlier Indra the lord of celestials killed the demons."

Shlok 18: Duly circumambulating that chariot (as a mark of respect) and offering his
salutation, when thus spoken by Matali, Rama then ascended the chariot, causing the three worlds to
shine forth with his splendour.

Shlok 19: Then ensued a tumultuous and thrilling battle, between the great armed Rama and
Ravana, the demon.

Shlok 20: That Rama, who was skilled in the use of great missiles, struck the missile presided
over by Gandharvas and the missile presided over by gods, by means of missiles of the same
type.

Shlok 21: Ravana, the king of demons was very much enraged and again released another
extra-ordinarily terrific missile presided over by demons.

Shlok 22: Those arrows, decked with gold, discharged from Ravana's bow, turning as they were
into highly poisonous snakes and rolled towards Rama.

Shlok 23: With flaming mouths wide open and vomiting blazing fire, those dreadful snake-like
arrows dashed towards Rama alone.

Shlok 24: All the quarters stood covered by highly poisonous serpents, whose impact was as
hard as that of Vasuki (the king of serpents), with the flaming coils. Even the corners between the
quarters stood enveloped by them.

Shlok 25: Seeing those serpents rushing towards him in the battle-field, Rama released the
terrific and dangerous missile presided over by Garuda the eagle (an enemy of serpents).

Shlok 26: With golden shafts which shone like flames, discharged by Rama's bow turning into
golden eagles (the enemies of serpents) those arrows flew all around.

Shlok 27: Those arrows of Rama, which can assume any form at will, appeared in the form of
eagles and destroyed all those arrows, which flew with a great speed in the form of snakes.

Shlok 28: Enraged on his missile having been frustrated by Rama, Ravana streamed forth
terrific showers of arrows on Rama.

Shlok 29: Tormenting Rama of unwearied action with thousand arrows, Ravana then pierced Matali
with a multitude of arrows.

Shlok 30: Targeting with only one arrow, Ravana tore off the flag-staff. Striking down the
golden flag-staff from the top of the chariot down to the seat of the chariot, Ravana struck even
Indra's horses with a multitude of arrows.

Shlok 31- 32: Seeing Rama afflicted, the gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Charanas the
celestials bards along with the demons, as also Siddhas the demi-gods and the great sages felt
dejected. Seeing the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by Rahu in the shape of Ravana, the
monkey-chiefs too, along with Vibhishana, felt perturbed.

Shlok 33: Seeing thus the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by the planet Rahu in the shape
of Ravana, the planet Mercury stood, assailing the constellation Rohini presided over by the god
Prajapati (the lord of creation), the beloved of the moon the heavenly body and spelling disaster
to all created beings.

Shlok 34: Blazing as it were in fury, the ocean rose high at that time, as though it was going
to touch the sun, its mist-wreathed waves moving to-and-fro.

Shlok 35: The sun, looking ashy in colour assuming a piercing aspect, and its rays grown
exhilarated, appeared in a headless trunk in its lap and united with a comet.

Shlok 36: The planet Mars stood assailing in the sky, the constellation Vishakha, presided
over by the gods Indra and Agni (the god of fire), which is adorned by the kings of Kosala.

Shlok 37: That Ravana, having ten faces and twenty arms, holding a bow tightly in his hands,
looked like Mount Mainaka.

Shlok 38: Being overwhelmed by Ravana the demon in the battle-front, Rama could not fit his
arrows to his bow.

Shlok 39: The enraged Rama, knitting his eye-brows and with his eyes turned slightly
blood-red, was provoked to fierce anger, as though he would burn out the demons.

Shlok 40: Seeing the face of the sagacious Rama getting provoked of anger, all the living
beings got frightened. The earth too began to tremble.

Shlok 41: The mountain, with lions, tigers and swaying trees, was trembled. Even the ocean,
the lord of rivers, became agitated.

Shlok 42: Dense clouds, emitting harsh sounds and assuming a stern aspect, roamed all over in
the sky, thundering.

Shlok 43: Seeing the very much enraged Rama and also the terrific portents, all the living
beings were frightened. Fear seized Ravana too.

Shlok 44- 45: Seated in their aerial cars, gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, great Nagas
(semi divine beings having the face of a man and the tail of a serpent), the sages, demons, giants
and those eagles remaining in the air, saw then the battle of two heroes, fighting steadily with
various dreadful weapons and looking like the final dissolution of the world.

Shlok 46: Getting rejoiced on observing that great battle, all the gods and demons who had
come to witness the conflict at that time, responded:

Shlok 47: The demons who reached there cried out to Ravana, "Be victorious!". Those gods
called to Rama saying again and again: "Be you victorious!".

Shlok 48-51: In the meantime, that evil-minded Ravana, who caused enemies to cry, stroking with
anger a great weapon wishing to strike Rama, took hold off with fury, a spike, which was powerful
as a thunderbolt, which made a loud noise (when hurled at a target), capable of exterminating all
enemies, resembling the mountain-peaks, which with its sharp points dreadful to conceive and to
behold, resembling a smoke-crested mass of fire blazing at the end of the world-cycle, exceedingly
furious, which was difficult to approach even for Death, which was unassailable, which was a terror
for all beings, capable as it was of tearing and splitting them and blazing as it was.

Shlok 52: That valiant Ravana, surrounded by warriors of demons in battle, was very much
enraged and took hold of that spear at its middle.

Shlok 53: With blood-red eyes in anger, Ravana with his collossal body, duly raising the spear
and bringing rejoice to his own army, roared terribly in battle.

Shlok 54: The terrific noise made by Ravana then trembled the earth, the sky, the four
quarters and the angles of the compass

Shlok 55: By that roar of that evil-minded Ravana of a collossal body, all the living beings
were frightened. The ocean too got agitated.

Shlok 56: Taking hold of that large spear, that Ravana of great prowess, emitting a very loud
roar, spoke the following harsh words to Rama:

Shlok 57: "Raised in fury by me, O Rama! This spear with the power of a thunder-bolt, will
take away surely your life along with the life of your bother, your help-mate."

Shlok 58: "Killing you with my strength now, I, who always commend war-fare, will make you
level with the valiant demons, who have been killed in the battle-front."

Shlok 59: "Wait, I will kill you with the spear now, O Rama!" Saying so, that demon hurled
that spear.

Shlok 60: That spear, wreathed as it was in a circle of lightning, provided as it was with
eight bells and making a loud noise, released from Ravana's hand, splashed, as it went into tehs
sky.

Shlok 61: Seeing that blazing spear of terrible appearance, the valiant Rama who was born in
Raghu dynasty, having stretched his bow, released the arrows.

Shlok 62: With streams of arrows, Rama warded off that spear, which was rushing upon him, as
with streams of water, Indra the lord of celestials warded off the fire shooting up at the time of
dissolution of the world.

Shlok 63: That large spear of Ravana consumed those arrows coming forth from Rama's bow, as
fire would consume the moths.

Shlok 64: Seeing those arrows smashed by coming into contact with the spear and reduced to
ashes even while positioned in the sky, Rama was seized with fury.

Shlok 65: That Rama, the delight of Raghus, was quite enraged and took hold of that spear
brought by Matali the charioteer, as desired by Indra the lord of celestials.

Shlok 66: That spear, lifted up by the powerful Rama, which was rendered resonated by the
bells, began to blaze like a blazing meteor at the time of the dissolution of the world.

Shlok 67: That spear, hurled by Rama, fell on that Ravana's spear. Torn down by Rama's spear,
the large spear of Ravana fell on the ground, with its lustre extinguished.

Shlok 68: With terrific arrows of high speed, with their shafts made of reeds, going straight
to their target, Rama pierced the exceedingly fleet horses of Ravana.

Shlok 69: With his sharp arrows, Rama then pierced the chest-region of Ravana. He also struck,
quite deliberately, the forehead of Ravana with three arrows.

Shlok 70: With all his limbs torn down by arrows and with blood flowing from his limbs, that
Ravana in the midst of demons, shone like a blooming Ashoka tree in the midst of a multitude of
trees.

Shlok 71: With his limbs severely injured by Rama's arrows and with his body bathed in blood,
that Ravana felt exhausted in the middle of a multitude of demons and gave went to a violent anger
at that time.

[Text] A ferocious battle ensues between Rama and Ravana, hurling thousands of arrows on
each other. Each one intercepts the other's arrows. Rama speaks harsh words to Ravana for having
carried away Seetha from Janasthana-forest to Lanka and vows that he will soon dispatch him surely
to the world of Death. Rama then pours down streams of arrows on Ravana. Rama more vehemently
torments Ravana with his sharp arrows and mystic missiles, till Ravana becomes helplessly weak and
confused. Ravana's charioteer carries away Ravana in the chariot, camly and slowly away from the
battle-front.

Shlok 1: Tormented by Rama in fury, that Ravana then for his part, who was boasting of his
fight, flew into a great rage.

Shlok 2- 3: Raising his bow, his eyes blazing with anger, extremely enraged as he was with Rama
in that great battle, the valiant Ravana of prowess continued to oppress, by covering Rama with
thousands of streams of arrows, as a rainy cloud would fill a pond with thousands of arrow-like
torrents from the sky.

Shlok 4: Covered by a multitude of arrows discharged from Ravana's bow in battle, Rama did
not wince, like a large mountain which was unshakable.

Shlok 5: The valiant Rama stood interrupting the torrents of arrows with his own arrows in
the battle-field and endured them as rays of the sun.

Shlok 6: Then, the enraged Ravana of brisk hand, struck thousands of arrows into the breast
of the great-souled Rama.

Shlok 7: Rama, bathed in blood in the battle-field, appeared like a very big Kimshuka tree
with bloom in a forest.

Shlok 8: Enraged at the impact of the arrows, that Rama of very great splendour , took hold
of arrows which shone like the sun at the time of dissolution of the world.

Shlok 9: Both Rama and Ravana who were see each other at that time in the battle-field, which
was shrouded in darkness by the arrows.

Shlok 10: Bursting into laughter, though filled with anger, the valiant Rama, the son of
Dasaratha spoke the following harsh words to Ravana.

Shlok 11: "O the worst of demons! Since you took away my helpless wife without my notice from
Janasthana, hence you are not a person of prowess."

Shlok 12: "Having taken away by force the miserable Seetha while she was staying in the forest
away from me, you think: ï¿½I am a champion'."

Shlok 13: "Having done an act of cowardly persons of laying your hands on another's wife,
posing as a hero in relation to women without a protector, you think: "I am a champion'."

Shlok 14: "O shameless person, who have broken the bounds of morality and are unstable of
customs, having laid hold through vanity of death (in the form of Seetha) you think ï¿½I am a
champion'."

Shlok 15: "Indeed a praiseworthy, great and glorious act has been performed by you, a valiant
brother of Kubera, the god of wealth, rich in strength!"

Shlok 16: "Reap now and today the stupendous fruit of that noxious and contemptible act,
perpetrated through sheer vanity."

Shlok 17: "O evil-minded one! You think: ï¿½I am a champion' yourself! Shame did not stand in
your way at all, for having taken away Seetha like a thief."

Shlok 18: "If Seetha were laid hands upon by you in my presence, you would have surely seen
your brother Khara at that very moment when killed with my arrows."

Shlok 19: "Thank heaven, O stupid fellow, you have come within the range of my sight. I will
dispatch you to the world of Death, by my sharp arrows, today."

Shlok 20: "Let your head, having blazing ear-rings lying on the dust-laden battle-field, be
carried away by beasts of prey, after being chopped off by my arrows today."

Shlok 21: "O Ravana! Let vultures fly down on your wounded breast when you have been thrown
down on the ground and oozing out from the orifices caused by the impact of my pointed
arrow-tips."

Shlok 22: "Let birds (such as crows and vultures) tear out your bowels, as eagles would drag
serpents when you fall down dead when pierced by my arrows today."

Shlok 23: Thus speaking, the valiant Rama, the annihilator of enemies, poured out streams of
arrows on Ravana, who was in the vicinity.

Shlok 24: The prowess, the strength, the enthusiasm and the stamina of arms of Rama became
two-fold, when he longed for the death of his enemy in battle.

Shlok 25: All kinds of mystic missiles came to light in the mind of Rama the learned self and
in his excessive enthusiasm, Rama of extra-ordinary energy became all the more swift-handed.

Shlok 26: Recognizing those good omens, Rama, the destroyer of demons, tormented Ravana even
more vehemently.

Shlok 27: While being struck by volleys of stones hurled by the monkeys and the showers of
arrows coming from Rama, Ravana felt bewildered at heart.

Shlok 28: Ravana could no longer take up weapons, nor stretch his bow, nor reacted to Rama's
prowess - on account of his mind being confused.

Shlok 29: As the time of his death approached, the arrows swiftly hurled and the various kinds
of missiles employed by Ravana did not turn to be of any use in battle.

Shlok 30: Seeing Ravana reduced to such a plight, the charioteer driving the chariot, for his
part, without getting excited, calmly and slowly carried off his chariot away from the
battle-front.

Shlok 31: On seeing Ravana, the king sunk down; hopelessly bereft of energy, the charioteer
diverting in haste the chariot of Ravana, which was rumbling like a cloud, thereupon sneaked away
from the battle-field in dismay.



SARGA 104
------------------------------

[Text] Ravana reproached the charioteer for having turned back his chariot away from the
battle-field. The charioteer explains to Ravana, the various reasons as to why he has taken back
the chariot. Satisfied with the explanation given by his charioteer, Ravana instructs him to take
the chariot back to the battle-field. Thereupon, the charioteer brings the chariot in an instant
before Rama on the battle-field.

Shlok 1: Impelled by force of Destiny and with his red-blood eyes through anger due to
infatuation, that Ravana spoke to his charioteer as follows:

Shlok 2- 3: "O evil-minded fellow! Despising me as though I were bereft of manliness, incapable,
deficient in prowess, cowardly, petty-minded, devoid of energy, bereft of brilliance, deserted of
conjuring tricks and abandoned by mystic missiles, you are acting as per your discretion!"

Shlok 4: "Why have you carried away this chariot of mine, thus humiliating me in the presence
of my enemies and overlooking my will?"

Shlok 5: "O vulgar fellow! You have destroyed my fame which was earned through a long period,
prowess, vital power and the trust of people today."

Shlok 6: "While my adversary, having an illustrious prowess and making others delightful
through feats of his valour, stood looking on, myself, who has an ardent desire for fighting and
who was made contemptible by you!"

Shlok 7: "O evil-minded fellow! In case you do not, by perversity, carry away this chariot at
any event, this expectation of mine that you stand corrupted by the enemy, will be a fact."

Shlok 8: "This act, which has been done by you, is only befitting of enemies. This is indeed
not the work of a friend, who wishes me well."

Shlok 9: "If you inhabited with me in Lanka for a long time and if you remember my merit,
drive back the chariot swiftly till my enemy does not withdraw."

Shlok 10: Hearing those harsh words of the foolish Ravana, the friendly-minded charioteer
spoke the following conciliatory words of Ravana:

Shlok 11: "I was neither frightened nor I was stupid. I was not bribed by the enemies, nor was
I a blunderer. I was not disloyal to you. I have not forgotten the benefits conferred by you."

Shlok 12: "An act which was not to your taste was done by me as something conducive to your
interest, by wishing well of you, for protecting your honour and with mind affectionately disposed
towards you through attachment."

Shlok 13: "O monarch! Like somebody who is petty-minded and unworthy, you ought not to hold
me, devoted as I am to your pleasure and good, quilty in this matter."

Shlok 14: "O monarch! Like somebody who is petty-minded and unworthy, you ought not to hold
me, devoted as I am to your pleasure and good, guilty in this matter."

Shlok 15: "I understand your exhaustion, due to your strenuous fighting in the great battle. I
am not reflecting on the inclination of your valour or on your superiority over your enemy."

Shlok 16: "The horses of my chariot were broken down and were exhausted by drawing the
chariot. They became miserable and thoroughly fatigued, like the cows lashed by heavy rain."

Shlok 17: "I am seeing inauspiciousness in all the portents, which appear to us in large
numbers and duly examined by me."

Shlok 18: "(Propitious and unpropitious) time and place, (good and bad) omens, facial as also
the strength and weakness of the warrior occupying the chariot must be ascertained (by a
charioteer)."

Shlok 19: "The eminences and depressions of the ground as well as the parts which are level
and rugged, the time appropriate for the combat and the visible weak points of the enemy must be
known (by a charioteer)."

Shlok 20: "How to arrive and retreat, how to hold one's position and to recede all this must
be known by a charioteer, seated in the chariot."

Shlok 21: "This action appropriate was taken by me in order to give rest to you and to these
horses of the chariot as also to relieve your terrible fatigue."

Shlok 22: "O the valiant lord! This chariot was not removed by me arbitrarily. That which was
done by me was because I was overwhelmed with affection for my master."

Shlok 23: "O annihilator of enemies! O hero! Give me a command! I will do that which you will
enjoin me to do, with due attention and with a mind which feels relieved of all that is due."

Shlok 24: Satisfied with the explanation given by his charioteer and applauding him in many
ways, Ravana who was avaricious of fighting, spoke the following words:

Shlok 25: "O charioteer! Take this chariot quickly towards Rama. Ravana does not turn back in
battle, without killing his enemies."

Shlok 26: Thus speaking Ravna the lord of demons was pleased and then presented a beautiful
and excellent ornament for the hand to him. That charioteer, after hearing Ravana's instruction,s
drove the chariot back to the battle-field.

Shlok 27: Impelled by Ravana's command, that charioteer thereupon quickly drove the horses
forward. Then, that chariot of Ravana stood within a moment, before Rama's chariot on the
battle-field.

[Text] Sage Agastya advises Rama to recites the 'Aditya Hridaya', a collection of verses in
praise of the sun-god, with a view to gaining victory.

Shlok 1- 2: Approaching Rama standing absorbed in fight in the battle-field, exhausted as he was
by the fight, and seeing Ravana who came nearby, facing him duly prepared for the battle, the
glorious sage, Agastya, who had come together with the gods, to perceive the battle, then spoke as
foolows:

Shlok 3: "O Rama, the mighty armed! Hear the following eternal secret, by which you can
conquer all the enemies in battle, my child!"

the wind-god, the fire-god, the created beings, the life-breath of the universe, the source of teh
seasons and the store-house of light."

Shlok 10: "An off-spring of Aditi, the progenitor of all, Surya the sun-god and the provocator
of acts in people, the courser in the sky, the nourisher of all iwth rain, the possessor of rays
the golden, the brilliant, having golden seed whose energy constitutes the seed of the universe and
the maker of the day."

Shlok 11: "He has seven green horses, is thousand-rayed, full of rays, the destroyer of
darkness, the source of happiness, maker of thinness, the infuser of life in the lifeless cosmic
egg and radiant."

Shlok 12: "He is a golden foetus, maker of coolness, creator of heat, the bringer of a day,
the one who is eulogized by all, pregnant with fire, the son of Aditi, the one who pacifies himself
in the evening and the destroyer of frost."

Shlok 13: "He is the lord of the sky, the disperser of darkness, the master of the three Vedas
(Viz. Rik, Sama and Yajur), the sender of thick rain, the friend of water and the on who courses
swiftly in the path of the sky."

Shlok 14: "He is the radiator of heat and adrned with a circle of rays. He is death himself,
tawny of hue, a giver of warmth to all, omniscent, all-formed, endowed with extra-ordinary
splendour, the one who has an affection in all and the source of all evolutes."

Shlok 15: "He is the controller of all lunar mansions, planets and stars, the creator of all
and the resplendent among the splendid. O god, appearing in twelve forms (in the shape of twelve
months in a year), hail to you."

Shlok 16: "Hail to you in the form of eastern mountain and hail to the western mountain. Hail
to the lord of host of luminaries and hail to the lord of the day."

Shlok 17: "Hail to you, the giver of victory, hail to you, the joy born of victory! Hail to
you, the god with green horses, hail to you, having thousands of rays! Hail, hail to you the son of
Aditi!

Shlok 18: "Hail to you, the fierce one, hail to you the valiant one! Hail to you, the one with
variegated colours! Hail to you, the awakener of the louts, hail to you, the furious one!"

Shlok 19: "Hail to you, the ruler of Brahma, Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu the infallible, the
sun-god, the light indwelling the solar orb, the resplendent one, the devourer of all, appearing in
form of Rudra."

Shlok 20: "Hail to you, the dispeller of darkness, the destroyer of cold, the exterminator of
foes, the one whose extent in immeasurable, the destroyer of the ungrateful, the god, who is the
ruler of all lights."

Shlok 21: "Hail to you, possessing the lustre of refined gold, the dispeller of ignorance, the
architect of the universe, the uprooter of darkness, the splendour incarnate, the onlooker of the
world!'"

Shlok 22: "This sun, the lord alone destroys and brings into existence all the brings. He
radiates heat by his rays. He sends the rain."

Shlok 23: "Planted in all created beings, he remains awake, when they have fallen asleep. He
alone is the oblation to the fire-god and the fruit attained by those who pour such oblations."

Shlok 24: "He comprises all the gods, as well as the sacrifies as also the fruit of all
sacrifices. He is a supremely competent one of all activities, which are found in all the
worlds."

Shlok 25: "O Rama! No individual glorifying this sun-god, in distresses in difficulties; in
the woods or in times of peril, comes to grief."

Shlok 26: "Worship this sun-god, the lord of the universe and the god of all gods with
undivided attention. Muttering this praise three times, you will come out victorious in
battles."

Shlok 27: "You will be able to kill Ravana at this very moment, O mighty armed one!" Saying
so, the sage, Agastya, thereupon, left as in the same way as he had come.

Shlok 28: Hearing this, Rama of extra ordinary energy, then became bereft of anguish. Feeling
greatly delighted, Rama retained that hymn in his memory with a devoted mind.

Shlok 29- 30: Sipping the water thrice and getting purified looking intently on the orb of the sun
and repeating this prayer, the valiant Rama obtained a great rejoice. Seizing hold of his bow and
seeing Ravana, Rama felt delighted in mind and marched forward for the fight. He stood voed to kill
Ravana, with an intense and all-sided effort.

Shlok 31: Seeing Rama with a delighted mind, and becoming most exhildrated on foreseeing the
death of Ravana, the sun-god, standing in the middle of a troop of celestials, exclaimed, "Hasten
up."

[Text] Seeing Ravana's chariot coming, Rama asks Matali the charioteer to be on his guard.
Bad omens prognosticating the fall of Ravana and good omens predicting the victory of Rama appeared
in the scene of battle-field.

Shlok 1- 2: Thrilling with rapture, that charioteer, the charioteer of Ravana, drove forward
quickly, his chariot, a chariot, which was capable of attacking the army of enemies, a wonderful
piece of art like Gandharva-city, an imaginary city in the sky, mounted with flags, yoked with
horses of excellent quality adorned with golden necklaces, filled with war-implements, adorned with
rows of flags and banners, which was devouring the sky as it were, making the earth resound, which
was the destroyer of the army of adversaries and caused delight to its own.

Shlok 3- 4- 5- 6: Rama saw that Ravana's chariot, which was coming speedily with a noise, bearing a
large flag-staff, yoked with black horses, endowed with a terrific luster, blazing like an aerial
car in the sky, with a luster of the sun, filled with lightning-like flags and with a beautiful
appearance of a rain-bow.

Shlok 7- 8: Seeing that chariot, releasing streams of arrows, like a cloud releasing streams of
rain, with a noise equal to that of a bursting mountain, struck with a diamond, Rama after
stretching his bow in a crescent shape, spoke to Matali, Indra's charioteer as follows:

Shlok 9- 10: "O Matali! From the way in which the enemy is marching forward from left to right
with a great speed in his chariot more, it appears that heart has been set by him upon destroying
himself in the battle."

Shlok 11: "Therefore, take care and march forward, facing the chariot of the enemy I wish to
destroy it, even as the wind would blow a cloud."

Shlok 12: "Without fear and flurry and with a steady heart and vision, and the movement of the
reins fully controlled, drive the chariot swiftly."

Shlok 13: "You need not be instructed by me, accustomed as you are to drive the chariot of
Indra the lord of celestials. Keen as I am to fight with a close attention, I am just reminding you
and not teaching you."

Shlok 14: Extremely gratified with those words of Rama, that Matali the excellent charioteer
of gods drove on the chariot.

Shlok 15: Passing the huge chariot of Ravana on the right, the charioteer then set Ravana
shaking, by the dust risen from the wheels of his own chariot.

Shlok 16: The enraged Ravana then, with his coppery eyes wide open, trembled Rama, who stood
facing his chariot, with arrows.

Shlok 17: Meeting fortitude with anger, though provoked with assault, Rama took hold of
Indra's bow, which was possessed of extra ordinary impulse in the battle-field.

Shlok 18: He also seized hold of arrows of exceeding swiftness, which were shining like
sun-beams. Then began that great battle between the two warriors (Rama and Ravana) who were
desirous of killing each other, while facing each other like two proud lions.

Shlok 19: Then, the gods along with the Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas the
demigods and great sages, desirous of Ravana's ruin, arrived to see the battle of both the
chariot-warrriors.

Shlok 20: Thereupon, terrific portents that caused one's hair to stand on end, appeared giving
an augury of doom to Ravana and prosperity to Rama.

Shlok 21: The god of rains poured blood on Ravana's chariot. Horrible winds blew from right to
left, forming circles.

Shlok 22: A large flock of vultures, roaming about in the sky, was flying forward in the same
direction in which Ravana's chariot was going.

Shlok 23: Lanka was overcast with dusk, resembling a (red) Japa flower. The land in Lanka, as
also the day appeared as if they were blazing.

Shlok 24: Large meteors, along with lightnings fell with great noise. Those entities, inimical
to Ravana, made demons to lament.

Shlok 25: The earth on which Ravana was there, trembled. The arms of fighting demons looked as
if they were clasped.

Shlok 26: Fallen before Ravana, the rays of the sun appeared coppery, yellow, white and dark,
like mineral ores on a mountain.

Shlok 27: The she-jackals followed by vultures hastily uttered inauspicious howls, on
beholding Ravana's face as also vomiting fire from their mouths.

Shlok 28: Scattering the dust upwards over the battle-field and clouding the vision of that
Ravana, the wind blew in a direction inimicable to him.

Shlok 29: Even without the appearance of clouds, thunderbolts fell on his army on all sides,
with a noise which was hard to endure.

Shlok 30: All the quarters and intermediate points of the compass became covered with darkness
and due to outpourings of dust, the sky became difficult to be seen.

Shlok 31: Hundreds of dreadful Sarika* birds, with their awful howls, terribly fighting there,
fell down upon Ravana's chariot.

[Commentary] *Sarika bird: zoological name: Turdus salica.

Shlok 32: His horses discharged sparks of fire from their hips and loins as also tears from
their eyes, releasing out fire and water at the same time continuously.

Shlok 33: Frightful portents in multitude thus sprang up, bringing danger and destruction to
Ravana.

Shlok 34: Pleasant and auspicious omens, depicting victory of Rama appeared on all sides,
before Rama.

Shlok 35: Seeing the pleasant omens depicting his victory, Rama was very much pleased and
considered Ravana as (already) dead.

Shlok 36: Then Rama, with the knowledge of all omens, having seen those portents in his own
way in the battle-field, obtained rejoice as well as extreme happiness and shown enhanced prowess
in combat.

[Text] Loosing arrows at each other, Rama and Ravana perform a fierce battle. Ravana's
flag-staff is thrown down by Rama's arrows. When Rama begins to cut off Ravana's head, another head
starts to crop up in its place. The fierce encounter continues thus for seven days.

Shlok 1: Then ensued a fierce and a prolonged chariot-duel between Rama and Ravana, which was
frightful to all the worlds.

Shlok 2: Then, the army of demons and the huge army of mokeys, stood motionless with their
weapons held fast in their hands.

Shlok 3: Having their hearts captivated in seeing those two warriors, a human being and a
demon, both in full strength engaged in a fight, all for their part experienced a great wonder.

Shlok 4: Having their hands occupied with various kinds of weapons, all those warriors stood
amazed in mind in beholding that duel. They did not go for war on each other.

Shlok 5: The demons beholding Ravana and the army of monkeys seeing Rama with their eyes in
amazement appeared as though they were paintings.

Shlok 6: Having made up their minds and being firm in their anger, those two warriors for
their part, Rama and Ravana fought fearlessly, as it were, on seeing the portents in the
battle.

Shlok 7: Rama, who was convinced that he was going to win and Ravana who was firmly persuaded
that he would die, then demonstrated the entire wealth of their prowess in battle on that
occasion.

Shlok 8: Thereupon, the valiant Ravana, fitting his arrows with anger, released them,
directing them towards the flag-staff fixed on Rama's chariot.

Shlok 9: Without even reaching the ensign on Indra's chariot and touching off the staff which
supported the banner of the chariot, the arrows fell on the ground.

Shlok 10: Thereafter, the valiant Rama too, in great anger, stretching his bow, proceeded with
his mind, to return blow for blow.

Shlok 11: Rama released a sharp arrow, looking like a huge serpent and which was unbearable,
as though blazing with its own splendour, directing towards Ravana's flag-staff.

Shlok 12: As the brilliant Rama released the arrow towards the flag-staff, that arrow, tearing
asunder Ravana's flag-staf, entered the earth.

Shlok 13- 14: That standard, mounted on Ravana's chariot, having been torn off, fell on the
ground. Seeing the thrown-down piece of his flag-staff, that mighty Ravana stood blazing as though
he was laughing with intolerance. Flaming up with anger, he showered a stream of arrows afflicted
as he was, with the power of wrath.

Shlok 15: Ravana struck Rama's horses with blazing arrows. Those divine horses were neither
shaken nor stumbled in the battle-field. They were indeed healthy at heart and felt as though they
were just struck with lotus-stalks.

Shlok 16: Seeing those horses unstumbled, Ravana then was very much enraged and released
showers of arrows.

Shlok 17: He also hurled maces, iron bludgeons, discs, iron clubs, mountain-tops, trees,
spikes and axes.

Shlok 18: Unwearied as he was in his heart and in effort, Ravana then employed streams of
missiles as a creation of magic and also thousands of arrows.

Shlok 19: In that battle, abundant rain of various missiles, which were tumultuous, generating
fear, terrific and attended with a terrible echo, descended.

Shlok 20: Leaving alone Rama's chariot, Ravana released arrows on the army of monkeys on all
sides, thus wholly covering the sky.

Shlok 21- 22: Ravana released arrows with a mind, which had given up all hope of survival. Seeing
that Ravana, who was interested in the battle, putting forth his great effort, Rama fitted Sharp
arrows to his bow, as though laughing and thereupon he loosed the arrows in hundreds and
thousands.

Shlok 23-24: Seeing those arrows, Ravana completely covered the sky with his own arrows. Due to
that dazzling shower of arrows then employed by the two warriors, the shining sky looked like a
second sky built with arrows.

Shlok 25: While Rama and Ravana were discharging the arrows thus in the battle0field, no arrow
missed the target, no one failed to pierce the target and none had gone in vain. Colliding with
each other, they fell on the ground.

Shlok 26: Releasing the arrows left and right continually, they fought at each other. With
their terrific arrows, they made the sky, bereft of even a breathing space.

Shlok 27: Rama struck Ravana's horses. Ravana struck Rama's horses. Both the warriors then
struck at each other, doing anything before and after.

Shlok 28: Those two extremely enraged warriors in this way, carried out are excellent combat.
A tumultuous battle ensued for an hour or so, causing the hair to stand erect.

Shlok 29: The mighty Ravana and Rama carried out the fight well with sharp arrows in the
battle-field. That Ravana at that time was very much enraged with Rama, as his flag-staff was
thrown down.

Shlok 30: All the created beings for their part gazed with an astonished mind on Rama and
Ravana, who thus were fighting at each other in the battle-field.

Shlok 31: Furiously attacking each other in the battle-field, those excellent chariots of the
two warriors ran towards each other.

Shlok 32: Intent on destroying each other, those chariots, displaying various types of
movements such as, moving in circles, moving straight and darting forward as also receding
forthwith, originated from the capabilities of those charioteers, assumed a terrible aspect.

Shlok 33: Rama wounding Ravana and Ravana too wounding Rama, both of them had recourse to
speed in movement in their forward and backward motions.

Shlok 34: Those excellent chariots, casting streams of arrows, strolled in the battle-field,
like two clouds pouring showers.

Shlok 35: Showing various kinds of movement in the battle-field, those chariots then again
stood facing each other.

Shlok 36: The shaft of the two chariots even as they stood at that moment, met one with the
other shaft the muzzle of the horses met the one with the other and the flags met the one with the
other flags.

Shlok 37: Then Rama, with his four sharp arrows discharged from his bow, drove back the four
splendid horses of Ravana.

Shlok 38: That Ravana, falling a prey to anger for retreating his horses, discharged sharp
arrows on Rama.

Shlok 39: Rama, who was severely struck by the mighty Ravana, did not get upset nor was even
tottered.

Shlok 40: Directing towards Matali, Indra's charioteer, Ravana hurled arrows with a sound
similar to that of a thunder-bolt.

Shlok 41: Arrows of great speed, fallen on Matali's body, did not cause even a pretty little
of bewilderment or hurt on him in that battle.

Shlok 42: Enraged at that daring attack on Matali, Rama who for his part did not feel provoked
by the attack on himself, made his enemy turn away by hurling a net work of arrows on him.

Shlok 43: The valiant Rama discharged twenty, thirty, sixty and hundreds and thousands of
arrows on the enemy's chariot.

Shlok 44: Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in the chariot,
tormented Rama, by showering maces and mallets on him in the battle.

Shlok 45-46: The battle thus started again by then, was tumultuous, causing one's hair to stand
erect. With the sounds of maces, mallets and iron rods and with the gusts raised by the plumes
adorning the flying arrows, the seven agitated oceans felt disquieted.

Shlok 47: Thousands of all the demons and serpents, inhabiting in the nethermost subterranean
region of the agitated oceans, felt disturbed.

Shlok 48: The entire earth, including mountains, groves and forests trembled. The sun too
became gloomy even the wind did not blow.

Shlok 49: Then, the gods along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas the
semi-divine beings, great sages and all including Kinnaras the mythical beings and great serpents
became disquieted.

Shlok 50-51: At that time, those gods along with troops of sages, saying "May all be well with
the cows and Brahmanas, May all the worlds endure forever, May Rama conquer Ravana!", saw a
terrific battle between Rama and Ravana, which caused one's hair to stand on end.

Shlok 52-53: Seeing that matchless struggle and observing that the sky is its own compeer and the
ocean is its own analogue, the battle between Rama and Ravana can be likened only to the battle
between Rama and Ravana, the hosts of Gandharvas the celestial musicians and Apsaras, the heavenly
lymphs, looked on that battle between Rama and Ravana.

Shlok 54-55: Thereupon, the great-armed Rama who augmented the fame of the kings born in Raghu
dynasty, stretching with anger, the serpent-like arrow with his bow, chopped off the glorious head
of Ravana, which was graced with blazing ear-rings. Then, all the three worlds saw that head,
fallen on the ground.

Shlok 56: Another head, exactly similar to that head, cropped up on the shoulders of Ravana.
That second head was again chopped off by Rama, possessing a swift hand and who was swift in his
act.

Shlok 57: The second head of Ravana was cut off by arrows in that battle. Soon after that head
was chopped off, it again rose into view.

Shlok 58: Rama chopped off that head too with his arrows looking like thunderbolts. In the
same manner, a hundred of Ravana's heads of equal splendour were chopped off by Rama.

Shlok 59: Yet, no certainty about Ravana's death could be seen. Thought equipped with many
arrows and well-versed with all kinds of missiles, the valiant Rama, the augmentor of Kausalya's
joy, then became thoughtful (said to himself as follows):

Shlok 60-61: "What is the reason, these arrows by which Mareecha, Khara, Dushana, Kabandha in
Kroucha-forest, and Viradha in Dandaka-forest were killed, by which seven Sala trees and the
mountains were burst, by which Vali was killed and the ocean shaken up all these arrows which
provided immediate succour to me in battle, have proved of little efficacy in the case of
Ravana."

Shlok 62: Thus absorbed in thought, Rama remained vigilant in the battle-field. He showered
streams of arrows in Ravana's chest.

Shlok 63: Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in his chariot,
tormented Rama by showering maces and mallets on him in the combat.

Shlok 64: That great tumultuous battle, which caused one's hair to stand on end, took place in
the sky, on the ground and furthermore on the mountain.

Shlok 65: While the gods, the demons, Yakshas the super-natural beings, the devils, the
serpents and the ogres were witnessing, that great battle occurred for seven days.

Shlok 66: There was no respite in battle between Rama and Ravana, either in the might or in
the day-time or for an hour or even for a instant.

Shlok 67: Not beholding the victory of Rama in the combat between Rama and Ravana that
great-souled Matali, the charioteer of Indra quickly spoke the following words to Rama, who was
still engaged in fighting.



SARGA 108
------------------------------

[Text] On the advice of Matali the charioteer, Rama employs on Ravana, a mystic missile
presided over by Brahma. That arrow penetrates Ravana's heart and kills him. Ravana falls down dead
from his chariot to the earth.

Shlok 1: Thereupon, Matali refreshed the memory of Rama as follows: "O the valiant one! Why
are you still carrying out the battle with Ravana as though you are unaware (of how to dispose of
him)?

Shlok 2: "O lord! You can employ a mystic missile presided over by Brahma the lord of
creation. The time for his destruction has come now, as expressed by the celestials."

Shlok 3-4: Then, the valiant Rama, who was reminded thus by Matali, took hold of a blazing
arrow, which was given by Brahma and which in turn was given to him by the glorious sage, Agastya
earlier in the battle-field and which looked like a hissing serpent.

Shlok 5: Having been made formerly for Indra, the lord of celestials by Brahma, the lord of
creation of infinite strength, it was bestowed in the past on the ruler of gods, who was desirous
of conquering the three worlds.

Shlok 6: In its feathers, wind was established. In its end-point were the fire and the sun.
In its heaviness were Mounts Meru and Mandara. Its shaft was made of ether.

Shlok 7: Provided with good shaft decked with gold, the arrow which had its body shining, had
been made up of the efficacy of all the elements and an illuminating power of the sun.

Shlok 8: Blazing like a fire at the time of universal dissolution enveloped in smoke and
looking like a venomous snake, it was swift in action and capable of bursting hosts of men,
elephants and horses.

Shlok 9: It broke gate-ways, iron bars, and even mountains. Smeared witht he blood of various
victims and quoted with their marrow, it presented a very terrific appearance.

Shlok 10: That arrow had an efficacy of a thunder bolt, loud-sounding, tearing off armies of
adversaries in many battles and creating fear to all, like a hissing serpent.

Shlok 11: It was giving perennial feed to vultures, eagles, cranes, troops of jackals and
demons in the battle-field, possessing a form of Yama the lord of Death and was fearful.

Shlok 12: That arrow bestowed joy on the monkey-leaders and destroyed the demons. It was made
speedy, by tying various kinds of beautiful coloured feathers of Garuda, the king of eagles, to
it.

Shlok 13-14: Making it sacred by a special formula as per the procedure specified in scriptures,
Rama who was endowed with an extraordinary strength then fixed that arrow which was the foremost
among the three worlds, capable of removing the fear of Ikshwaku dynasty, taking away the glory of
the enemies and bestowing joy to one's own self on his bow.

Shlok 15: While that excellent arrow was being fixed by Rama, all the beings were frightened
and the earth trembled.

Shlok 16: That enraged Rama, stretching his bow well and with an attentive mind, hurled that
arrow which can tear off the vitals, towards Ravana.

Shlok 17: That arrow, which was inviolable as a thunderbolt hurled by the arms of Indra and
irresistible as Yama the lord of Death, fell upon Ravana's chest.

Shlok 18: That arrow, released with great speed and which was capable of destroying the body,
tore off the heart of that evil-minded Ravana.

Shlok 19: That arrow, which was capable of causing death to the body, after taking away the
life of Ravana and having been anointed with blood, penetrated the earth.

Shlok 20: Smeared with blood on having killed Ravana and thereby accomplishing its mission,
that arrow re-entered its own quiver (of Rama) silently.

Shlok 21: From the hands of the slain Ravana, who was being separated from his life, fell his
bow with its arrows (fitted to it), at the same time coinciding indeed with his life-breath.

Shlok 22: Having lost his life, that king of demons for his part, who was endowed with
terrible swiftness and invested with great splendour, fell down from the chariot to the ground ,
like Vritra the demon when the latter was struck down by the thunderbolt.

Shlok 23: Seeing Ravana fallen down on earth, the surviving demons whose king had been killed,
were panic stricken and ran away to all sides.

Shlok 24: The monkeys, who fought with trees, fell upon the demons from all sides. Seeing the
killing of Rvana, the monkeys assumed a triumphant appearance.

Shlok 25: Tormented by the monkeys, the demons rushed back with panic towards Lanka, with
faces looking miserable and tears flowing down, their supporter having been killed.

Shlok 26: Roaring shouts of joy, quite rejoiced as they were, and proclaiming Rama's victory
and the killing of Ravana in his hands, the monkeys behaved like conquerors.

Shlok 27: Then the cheerful kettle-drum of the gods reverberated in the sky. Very pleasant
winds, carrying divine odour, blew there.

Shlok 28: Pouring over the chariot of Rama quite fascinating shower of flowers, which was
difficult to be accomplished (elsewhere), fell from the heavens to the earth on that occasion.

Shlok 29: Excellent pronouncements of the great-souled gods saying "well done! Bravo!",
combined with a panegyric in praise of Rama, was distinctly heard in the sky.

Shlok 30: When Ravana, the cruel demon and the terror of all the worlds, was killed, a great
rejoice filled the hearts of gods and charanas the celestial bards.

Shlok 31: Having been pleased with the killing of Ravana, Rama then fulfilled the desire of
Sugreeva, Angada and Vibhishana.

Shlok 32: Then, troops of celestials got their mental peace. All the quarters were brightened
up and the sky became clear. The earth did not tremble. The wind blew gently. The sun too shed a
steady light.

Shlok 33: Rejoiced with the victory in battle, Sugreeva, Vibhishana and Angada together with
Lakshmana along with their friends paid their respects with due ceremony to Rama, who looked
charming.

Shlok 34: That Rama, the delight of Dasaratha, for his part, who had just killed his enemy and
thus who was steadfast in his vows and who was endowed with a great splendour, who stood surrounded
on the battle-field by his own people and the army shone like Indra the lord of celestials.



SARGA 109
------------------------------

[Text] Vibhishana laments a lot, after seeing Ravana lying dead on the battle-field. Rama
comforts him, saying that a warrior killed in battle, need not be mourned. Vibhishana describes the
personality of Ravana and his qualities to Rama and seeks permission of Rama to perform funeral
rites to Ravana. Rama directs Vibhishana to perform the obsequies to Ravana, his deceased
brother.

Shlok 1: Seeing his brother lying down dead after defeat in battle, Vibhishana lamented, with
his mind filled with an outburst of sorrow:

Shlok 2: "Why are you lying killed on the ground, though you are highly worthy of turning
towards lofty beds, O hero! The valiant one, the celebrated one, prudent in polity?"

Shlok 3: "Having thrown about your two long arms which though decked wit armlets, are now
motionless and with your diadem brilliant as the sun, knocked down; why are you lying killed on the
ground/"

Shlok 4: "O the valiant brother! That which was told by me earlier and that which was not
liked by you, as you were overcome with sensuality and infatuation; that very fate has been
obtained by you."

Shlok 5: "For that which, because of arrogance, neither Prahasta nor Indrajit and others, nor
Kumbhakarna nor Atiratha nor Narantaka nor you yourself has agreed to my counsel, the consequence
of it has come now."

Shlok 6-7: "As this hero, the foremost of those who wield the weapons, has fallen on the
ground, the established rule of well-conducted persons has gone. The incarnation of virtue has
departed. The epitome of strength has gone. The refuge of enlogies has gone out of sight. The sun
has fallen to the earth. The moon has merged in darkness. Fire has extinguished its flames and a
strennous effort has become inactive."

Shlok 8: "What is remaining in this world now, while Ravana the foremost of demons, is at
present lying fast asleep in the dust?"

Shlok 9: "With firmness for its shoot, endurance for its excellent blossom, asceticism for
its strength, and valour for its firm root, the large tree in the shape of Ravana has been crushed
in the battle-field, by the tempest in the shape of Rama."

Shlok 10: "With sharpness for its tusks, the line of ancestors for its back-bone, anger for
its lower parts and graciousness for its proboscis, the elephant in rut in the shape of Ravana is
lying asleep on the ground, its body having been overthrown by a lion in the shape of Rama."

Shlok 11: "With prowess and power for its expanded flames, sighs for its smoke and his native
strength for its glowing heat, the blazing fire in the shape of Ravana the demon has been
extingushed in the battle-field by the rainy cloud in the shape of Rama."

Shlok 12: "With the demons for its tail; hump and horn and fickleness for its ears and eyes,
the bull in the shape of Ravana the demon, the conqueror of its enemies, which vied with the wind
in energy, is lying dead, struck down by a tiger in the shape of Rama, the ruler of the earth."

Shlok 13: To Vibhishana, who was thus speaking; enveloped in sorrow, Rama spoke the following
words, full of reason and which revealed his determined view of the matter.

Shlok 14: "Ravana did not die in battle, without making an effort. He has fallen in combat,
eventhough he was endowed with terrible prowess and exhibited extra ordinary enthusiasm of a very
exalted type and remained confident throughout."

Shlok 15: "There is no occasion to grieve for him having fallen into death in the battle-field
and by whom the development of his country was wished for, while remaining steadfast in the duty of
Kshatriya the warrior."

Shlok 16: "There is no occasion to grieve for his having been brought under the sway of death
by whom intelligent as he was, all the three worlds including indra were frightened."

Shlok 17: "In the past, none has ever been exclusively victorious in a combat. A hero either
has been killed by his adversaries or had killed the enemies in battle."

Shlok 18: "Such is the destiny proclaimed by the ancients, as highly esteemed for a warrior. A
warrior killed in battle, does not deserve to be mourned. Such is the ascertainment of the sacred
scriptures."

Shlok 19: "Therefore, seeing this ascertainment, understanding the true principle, and free
from grief, think here of what duty that deserves to be performed."

Shlok 20: To that valiant prince (Rama) by whom the aforesaid words were spoken, Vibhishana,
who was tormented with grief, spoke (as follows) about the suitable action to be done next in
relation to his brother.

Shlok 21: "The demon, who had never been conquered before in battles, by even all the gods
combined or by Indra himself, has been conquered, on confronting you in the battle-field, as the
sea breaks up, on reaching the shore."

Shlok 22: "By him, gifts were endowed to to mendicents. Pleasures too were enjoyed. The king's
servents were fully maintained. Rches were made over to friends. Grudges against enemiies were
revenged."

Shlok 23: "He maintained a perpetually sacred fire. he practised great religious austerities.
He completely mastered Vedas, the sacred scriptures. He was highly proficient even in the ritual
acts. I desire to do, with you graciousness, that which is to be performed to him, who has departed
to the other world."

Shlok 24: Thus getting the personality of Ravana well-acquainted by vibhishana by his
compassionate words, Rama possessing unimpaired goodness, directed Vibhishana to perfom funeral
rites, which were intended to lead the departed soul to heaven:

Shlok 25: "Hostilities end with death. Our purpose has been accomplished. Let his funeral
rites be performed. He is even as good mine, as yours."



SARGA 110
------------------------------

[Text] All the consorts of Ravana lament, recollecting the valour of Ravana and with a
stunning surprise of how he has been killed by an ordinary mortal. They feel sorry that, had Seetha
been restored by Ravana to Rama, this major disaster would not have befallen them.

Shlok 1: Seeing Ravana killed by the great-souled Rama, the female-demons were stricken with
grief and rushed out from their gynaecium.

Shlok 2: Even though impeded now and then by their maid servants, they were rolling in the
dust of the streets, with their hair dishevelled, tormented as they were with grief like cows that
had lost their calf.

Shlok 3-4: Issuing out of the northern gate along with demons and penetrating into the terrific
battle-field, searching for their husband, who had been killed and crying out, "Ah my lord! Ah my
husband!" they all ran hither and thither on the ground which was covered with headless trunks and
rendered muddy with blood."

Shlok 5: Those women, who were overcome with grief about the death of their husband, having
their eyes filled with tears, loudly lamented like female-elephants who had lost the leader of
their herd.

Shlok 6: Those women saw the gigantic Ravana, who was endowed with a great strength and
invested with a great splendour, lying killed on the ground, like a heap of black collyrium.

Shlok 7: Suddenly seeing their husband lying in dust of the battle-field, those women fell
down on his limbs, like uprooted wild creepers.

Shlok 8: A woman wept, embracing him out of great regard, another woman clinging to his feet
and another, catching hold of his neck.

Shlok 9: A woman rolled over the ground, with her arms thrown up. On seeing the face of her
deceased husband, another woman fell into a swoon.

Shlok 10: Keeping Ravana's head in her lap, a woman, looking at his face, wept moistening that
face with her tears, as dew drops moisten a lotus-flower.

Shlok 11-13: "That Ravana, by whom Indra was thrown into fear, Yama was struck with terror, by
whom Kubera the king was deprived of Pushpaka the aerial car, and by whom fear was caused on the
battle-field in the Gandharva the celestial musicians, in the sages and the great-souled gods, lies
killed in the battle-field."

Shlok 14: "This danger has come from a mortal to him, who did not conceive any fear from the
demons or the gods or even the serpents for that matter!"

Shlok 15: "Here lies killed in battle, by a pedestrian man coming from Ayodhya, that Ravana,
who was incapable of being killed by gods and even so by devils and demons too."

Shlok 16: "He who could not be killed by gods, Yakshas and demons alike, could be killed by a
mortal like one devoid of strength."

Shlok 17: Thus uttering, those women of Ravana, wailing as aforesaid, burst into tears. They
once more and repeatedly lamented, stricken, as they were, with grief (as follows):

Shlok 18: "For your own death, Seetha was borne away by you, who did not listen to your near
and dear ones, who always offered friendly counsel to you. The demons were struck down. Here, stand
we (your consorts) as well as your own self, struck down now."

Shlok 19: "Though tendering salutary advice to you, Vibhishana your beloved brother, was
harshly scolded through ignorance by you, who sought your own destruction."

Shlok 20: "If you had restored Seetha a princess of Mithila to Rama, this appallingly terrific
disaster, which has robbed us of every root, would not have befallen us."

Shlok 21: "If you had restored Seetha to Rama, Vibhishana your brother would have had his
desire fulfilled. Rama would have been in the company of our allies. All of us would have been
spared the curse of widowhood and our enemies would not have realized their ambition."

Shlok 22: "By you, however, who forcefully captivated Seetha cruelly, the demons, we (your
consorts) and your own self all the three have been destroyed all at once."

Shlok 23: "O the excellent demon! Your act of following your own free will, may not be the
reason for your destruction, either for, all is being run by a divine power, struck and ruined by
the divine power."

Shlok 24: "This destruction of the monkeys, your demons as also yourself, in the battle, has
happened at the juncture of the Providence (alone), O the great armed!"

Shlok 25: "The course of destiny, when ready to bear fruit, cannot be diverted either by
money, or by wish, or by valour or even by command in this world."



Those consorts of Ravana, depressed as they were and afflicted with grief, with
their eyes full of tears, thus lamented like female ospreys.



SARGA 111
------------------------------

[Text] Mandodari stares at the dead body of Ravana and laments, recollecting the strength
and power of Ravana. But, she realizes that Rama, who killed Ravana, is none other than Vishnu the
lord of maintenance of the world. She further laments that Ravana has done a sinful deed in
abducting Seetha and that he has faced the consequence in the form of his death; in the hands of
Rama. She describes the charming personality and the unconquerable prowess of Ravana, but expresses
her surprise how he has been killed by a mortal like Rama. Mandodari's co-wives console her.
Meanwhile, Rama asks Vibhishana to perform obsequies to Ravana. Initially, Vibhishana refuses to
perform the last rites, but when Rama convinces him, he begins to perform the funeral of Ravana.
After the funeral is over, Vibhishana comes and joins Rama, who along with Lakshmana, Sugreeva and
others experience happiness for having destroyed their enemy.

Shlok 1: While those consorts were weeping on that occasion, Mandodari, the senior most and
beloved wife of Ravana, who was feeling miserable, stared at her husband.

Shlok 2: Gazing at Ravana, her husband who was killed by Rama of unimaginable exploits,
Mandodari there, miserably lamented (as follows):

Shlok 3: "O the great armed, the brother of Kubera! Even Indra the destroyer of strongholds,
indeed dares not to stand before you, when you were enraged."

Shlok 4: "Because of fear from you, eminent sages, illustrious Gandharvas the celestial
musicians and the wandering bards indeed fled in all directions."

Shlok 5: "O the lord of demons! O king! How is it that you are not ashamed, though you were
conquered in battle, by Rama, a mere mortal?"

Shlok 6: "How did a mortal, wandering in a forest, killed you, who having overcome the three
worlds by dint of your prowess, had grown irresistible and were endowed with glory?"

Shlok 7: "It is not possible of annihilation of yourself, who lived in a place not accessible
to men and was able to assume any form at your will, by Rama in battle."

Shlok 8: "I do not believe this act of Rama in the battle-front, nor do I believe of the
attack by him, on your army, fully equipped with all the implements of war."

Shlok 9: "The moment your brother Khara was killed by Rama in Janasthana, though surrounded
by a multitude of demons, it became evident that Rama was really no mortal."

Shlok 10: "We felt painful, the moment Hanuma penetrated, by dint of his prowess, deep into
the City of Lanka, which was difficult to be entered even for gods."

Shlok 11: "The day when the terrific monkeys built a bridge on the great ocean, that day
itself I believed that Rama was not an ordinary mortal."

Shlok 12: "Otherwise, for your destruction, Yama, the lord of Death came himself assuming the
form of Rama having arranged an unimaginable form of illusion."

Shlok 13: "O the mighty lord! Otherwise, you might have been overpowered by Indra the lord of
celestials. But for Indra, where is the capacity even to behold you in battle?

Shlok 14-17: "This Rama is certainly a great ascetic, an eternal person, having no beginning
middle or end, greater than distinguished universal spirit like Brahma, the one beyond ignorance,
the nourisher, wielding a conch, a disc and a mace, wearing the 'Srivatsa' mark on his chest, of
lasting beauty, incapable of being conquered, a perpetual one, being the constant soul of the
universe, truly mighty, the lord of all the worlds, the prosperous one having a great splendour and
Vishnu, the lord of maintenance of the world with a wish to benefit the worlds, assuming a human
form surrounded by all the gods in the form of monkeys, Rama killed you, surrounded by demons.

Shlok 18: "In the past, by performing a great penance, you conquered the senses and conquered
the three worlds. Now, as if revenging that enmity, those very senses conquered you."

Shlok 19-20: "The moment your brother Khara was killed by Rama in Janasthana, though surrounded
by a multitude of demons, it became evident that Rama was really no mortal. We felt perturbed, the
moment Hanuma penetrated, by dint of his prowess, deeply into the City of Lanka, which was
difficult to be entered even for gods."

Shlok 21: "This evil result has come upon you, since you did not heed to my advice, saying
that no hostility should be entered into with Rama."

Shlok 22: "O the foremost of demons! For the annihilation of your power, your body and your
own people, you conceived a desire for Seetha suddenly."

Shlok 23: "O the foolish one! An unworthy act was indeed done by you, in offending Seetha, who
was more distinguished and more respectable than Arundhati (wife of sage Vasishta) and Rohini (the
principal spouse of moon-god)."

Shlok 24-25: "O my lord, who annihilated yourself and your people! Seetha is the model of
forbearance even to the Goddess Earth and a model of grace to Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune and
charm. She is extremely fond of her husband. By a recourse to a fraud in bringing that Seetha in a
lonely forest, faultless in every limb as she was, and charming though miserable, and having failed
to fulfill your desire for union with Seetha and due to your own fault you have been surely
consumed by the asceticism of that woman, devoted as she was to her husband."

Shlok 26: "It is because, the gods together with Indra the ruler of gods including those
headed by the fire-god fear you, that you were not consumed even while you were laying hands on
Seetha, the slender-waisted woman."

Shlok 27: "There is no doubt that when the time comes, the doer surely reaps a harsh fruit of
his sinful deed."

Shlok 28: "The doer of an auspicious act obtains happiness, while the doer of a sinful act
reaps misery. While Vibhishana has obtained happiness, you met with such an evil destiny."

Shlok 29: "There are other women, more excellent in form than Seetha for you in your
gynaecium. Having fallen a prey to the power of passion, you did not know it through
ignorance."

Shlok 30: "Seetha is no match for me either in birth or in beauty or in amiability. You did
not perceive this through infatuation."

Shlok 31: "At any time, there is no causeless death for any living being. As for you, this
Seetha has become a cause."

Shlok 32: "Death which was brought about on account of Seetha was invited by you from a
far-off distance. Free from sorrow, Seetha will now be enjoying herself with Rama."

Shlok 33-35: "I, however, whose stock of merit was deficient, have fallen into a terrific ocean
of grief. I, who having enjoyed myself with you in suitable aerial cars in Mount Kailasa, mount
Mandara, Mount Meru and in a grove named Chaitraratha and in all celestial gardens, decked as was
with lovely garlands and clad in colorful robes and invested in matchless splendour, visiting and
seeing various lands of every description have now been deprived of all sense- enjoyments because
of your death. Though the same, I stand transformed into another as it were. Woe be to the
flickering fortunes of kings!"

Shlok 36-39: "Alas, O king! That face of yours which was so tender, O lord, and distinguished by
charming eye-brows, a gloss surface, having an exceptionally prominent nose, coppery lips and
brilliant ear-rings, which vied with the moon the lotus and the sun in loveliness, light and
luster, was illumined by a number of diadems, which shone with its eyes wild and rolling through
inebriety in banqueting places, bore garlands of various kinds, was lovely and charming in every
way, was lit with a captivating smile and indulged in a delightful talk - that face of yours does
not actually shine as before today pierced with Rama's arrows, it lies dyed with streams of blood.
It has its marrow shattered and has got soiled through the dust raised by the chariots."

Shlok 40: "Alas! The last stage of my life, which conferred widow ship on me, has come and
which was never contemplated me at any time; a stupid woman as I am."

Shlok 41: "I was very much proud that my father was king of demons, my husband a lord of
demons and my son, a conqueror of Indra the lord of celestials."

Shlok 42: "I had a firm conviction that my guardians were capable of crushing their arrogant
adversaries, heroes as they were, renowned for their might and valour, and as such had no fear from
any quarter."

Shlok 43: "How did this unknown danger come from a mortal to you, who were so powerful?"

Shlok 44-48: "O king! The body of yours which was really dark as glossy sapphire, gigantic like a
lofty mountain and resplendent with Keyuras and Angadas (two varieties of armlets) and necklace of
cat's eye-gems and pearls and wreaths of flowers, which body looked more charming during your
pleasure-walks and dazzling in battle-fields, which shone with luster of jewels as a rainy cloud
with flashes of lightning lies transfixed in numerous sharp arrows today. Though it will be
difficult for me to touch it again, it is no longer possible to embrace it. It has tendons cut to
pieces, by arrows of Rama, dug deep into your vital parts and closely transfixed like the spines of
a porcupine. Though dark of complexion, it is now transformed into the colour of blood and lies
fallen on the ground like a mountain broken into pieces when hit by a stroke of thunder-bolt."

Shlok 49: "Alas! Is it a dream? Is it the reality? But, how could you be killed by Rama? You
were the death, even to Death himself. How did you depart from this world, falling under the sway
of Death?

Shlok 50: "My husband enjoyed the wealth of all the three worlds. He gave tremendous fear to
the three worlds. He conquered the guardians of the worlds and lifted up Lord Shiva (along with his
seat, Mount Kailasa)."

Shlok 51: "My husband held down those who were arrogant. He manifested his prowess and shook
up the worlds. He caused the living beings to weep, with his roars."

Shlok 52: "He used to utter arrogant words with vigour in the presence of his enemies. He was
the protector for his troop and his servants. He was the killer of those who indulged in terrible
acts."

Shlok 53: "He was the killer of the lords of demons and Yakshas the super natural beings in
thousands. He was drawing to himself, the demons called Nivatakavachas, in battles."

Shlok 54: "My husband ruined several sacrificial performances. He was the protector of his own
people. He violated the moral order. He violated the moral order. He created conjuring tricks on
the battle-field."

Shlok 55: "He used to bring the virgin-daughters of gods, demons and human beings from here
and there. He brought mourning to his enemy's wives. He was the leader of his own people."

Shlok 56: "He was the protector of the island of Lanka. He was the doer of terrible deeds. He
was the bestower of desires and sensual gratifications to us. He was excellent among the
chariot-warriors."

Shlok 57: "Seeing my husband with such power struck down by Rama, I, having my husband killed,
am hard-hearted indeed, still bearing this body."

Shlok 58: "Having reposed on very valuable coaches, O the king of demons, why are you lying
buried in sleep slumber on the bare ground and shrouded in dust?"

Shlok 59: "When Indrajit, your son was killed in battle by Lakshmana, I was hard-hit then and
today, of course, I am completely beaten down."

Shlok 60: "Bereft of kinsfolk and forsaken by you, my lord, and deprived of desires and
sensual enjoyments, I shall lament for ever more years."

Shlok 61: "O king! Having embarked today on a long journey, which is very difficult to be
traversed, take me too with you, tormented as I am with grief. I shall not survive without
you."

Shlok 62: "Why do you intend to go, leaving me here, miserable as I am? Why do you not speak
to me, a sad and lamenting creature, and unfortunate as I am?"

Shlok 63: "O Lord! Are you not indeed enraged, in seeing me on foot in this way out through
the city-gate, unveiled and come on foot in the way?

Shlok 64: "O lover of your consorts! Look at all your spouses, who came out, with their veils
dropped off. Why are you not getting enraged in seeing this?"

Shlok 65: "This Mandodari, who was helping in your sport with you, is weeping with
helplessness. You are not consoling her. Do you not have a high esteem of her?"

Shlok 66-67: "You have fallen under the sway of your enemies in that you were cursed by the
numerous women of noble lineage, who, though devoted to their husband, fond of piety and intent on
the service of their elders, had been widowed by you, O king, and were accordingly tormented with
grief. That curse which was pronounced at that time by those aggrieved women on their having been
wronged by you, has fallen on you."

Shlok 68: "The popular saying that the tears of virtuous wives d not generally fall on the
ground in vain' has come out probably true in your case O king!"

Shlok 69: "How was this mean act of abducting a lady, done by you, who having invaded the
three worlds, were proud f your prowess?"

Shlok 70: "It was indeed a mark of your cowardice that Rama's consort was borne away by you,
after luring away Rama from his hermitage in the pretext of deer"

Shlok 71: "I do not recall your faint-heartedness at any time on the battle-field. That case
of abduction of Seetha, however, was due to your ill-luck and certainly as the result of your
sins."

Shlok 72-74: "O the mighty armed one! Whatever my younger brother-in-law, Vibhishana who knows
matters relating to the pat and of the future and also conversant with the present said after
reflecting and sighing for long, on seeing Seetha abducted by you: 'The destruction of the chiefs
among the demons now is imminent, have become true words. This misfortune had come from the lust,
wrath and addiction to the vice of deep attachment."

Shlok 75: "This major disaster occurred, destroying our very root, because of you. This entire
race of demons has been deprived of its protector, by you."

Shlok 76: "You, who were far illustrious for your strength and prowess, do not deserve to be
lamented for by me. But, because of feminine nature, my mind is leaning towards melancholy."

Shlok 77: "By taking away your merit and sin, you obtained your course of fate. I, however,
mourn for my own self, so afflicted as I am, by your death."

Shlok 78: "O Ravana! You did not hear the advice of your friends, who wish for your welfare.
Nor did you hear the words of your brothers completely."

Shlok 79: "The counsel offered by Vibhishana, which was endowed with reason, meaning, rule of
conduct, wholesome, gentle and well-founded, was not implemented by you."

Shlok 80: "The advices offered by Mareecha, Kumbhakarna, myself and my father have not been
heeded by you, who were arrogant of your prowess. What is followed is a bitter consequence of your
perversity."

Shlok 81: "My lord, resembling a dark cloud in hue, clad in yellow and decked with brilliant
armlets, why are you lying with your limbs, cast away on the ground and bathed in blood?"

Shlok 82: "As though fast asleep, why are you not replying to me, the granddaughter of Somali
the demon who was clever, endowed with extraordinary prowess and never retreated in battles,
tormented with grief as I am?"

Shlok 83: "Arise, arise! Why are you lying down, though subjected to a fresh insult? The sun's
rays have penetrated deep into Lanka today, without any fear."

Shlok 84-85: "Torn into thousand pieces, that iron bludgeon of yours, which was brilliant as the
sun, like a thunderbolt of Indra, with which you killed your enemies in the battle-field, which was
constantly honoured by you, which had struck many in battle and which was decked with gold, lies
scattered."

Shlok 86: Why are you lying down, embracing the battle-ground, as one would embrace a loved
one? Why do you not feel inclined to reply to me, as though I were abhorrent to you?"

Shlok 87: "Woe be to me, that my heart is not bursting into pieces, tormented as I am with
grief, now that you have returned to the five elements."

Shlok 88: Lamenting thus, with her eyes filled with tears and her heart moistened with love,
Mandodari, at that time, fell into a swoon.

Shlok 89: Fallen on the breast of Ravana, that dispirited Mandodari, stricken as she was with
grief, shone like a vivid flash of lightning across a rainy cloud, reddened by the flow of
twilight.

Shlok 90: Raising up Mandodari, who was in that condition bitterly weeping, her co-wives who
were also weeping, very much distressed as they were, began to console her (as follows):

Shlok 91: "Don't you know the uncertain state of the worlds, O queen, that the wealth of kings
is unsteady, when there is a change in the tide of their fate?"

Shlok 92: While they were consoling thus, Mandodari, moistening her breasts and her spotless
face in tears, wept aloud at that moment.

Shlok 93: In the meanwhile, Rama spoke to Vibhishana as follows: "Let the obsequies of your
brother be performed and let these crews of women be consoled."

Shlok 94: Reflecting with his intellect, the intelligent Vibhishana, the knower of virtue,
thereupon, spoke to Rama, the following words, which were in conformity with righteousness and
self-interest.

Shlok 95: "I am not obliged to perform the obsequies to him, who had abandoned the vow of
virtue, who was cruel, who killed human beings, who was a cheater and who had longed for others'
wives."

Shlok 96: "This Ravana, who was interested in wishing evil to all, though venerable as a
respectable elder, is not fit for honour. He is my enemy, in the guise of a brother."

Shlok 97: "If I do not perform obsequies, O Rama, the human beings on earth will speak about
me as ruthless. But, on hearing about his bad qualities all of them will speak of it as a good
act."

Shlok 98: Hearing those words, Rama the best among the supporters of virtue and skilled in
speech, was very much pleased and spoke the following words to Vibhishana, the intelligent one in
his speech.

Shlok 99: "O king of demons! I too have to do a favour to you. I won the battle because of
you. Certainly I have to give you an appropriate advice."

Shlok 100: "This demon may be full of unrighteousness and falsehood. But, he was brilliant,
strong and ever a brave warrior in battles."

Shlok 101: "It is heard that Ravana who was mighty, endowed with strength and who was causing
people to cry, was not conquered by the chiefs like Indra and others."

Shlok 102: "Hostilities end with death. Our purpose has been accomplished. Let his funeral
rites be performed. He is even as good mine also, as yours."

Shlok 103: "According to rule, Ravana is eligible to get the last rites on his dead body from
you, by usage. You will also become fit for glory."

Shlok 104: Having heard the words of Rama, Vibhishana in haste began to do obsequies to Ravana,
his dead brother.

Shlok 105: Entering the City of Lanka, that Vibhishana, the lord of demons, quickly concluded
the Agnihotra (the act of pouring oblations into the sacred fire) carried on by Ravana.

Shlok 106-107: Vibhishana actually caused to be brought together, carts, excellent varieties of
firewood, the three sacred fires and the priests required to officiate at the obsequies, logs of
sandalwood, various types of firewood, pieces of fragrant aloe-wood, odorous perfumes, as well as
gems, pearls and corals.

Shlok 108: Surrounded with demons, he came back for a while and thereupon, Vibhishana along
with malyavan (the father of his own mother) initiated the obsequies.

Shlok 109-111: Placing Ravana, the lord of demons, who was covered with linen, accompanied by
blasts of various musical instruments as well as panegyrists singing his the Brahmanas (forming
part of the demon's race, which was apparently divided into four classes, like human beings) stood
around him with their faces filled in tears. Lifting up that palanquin, which had been decorated
with colorful flags and flowers and taking up blocks of wood, all the demons for their part, with
Vibhishana in front, proceeded with their face turned towards the south.

Shlok 112: Those sacrificial fires were ignited and re-animated, as they were, by Adhvaryu
priests, the performers of the sacrificial act, at that time. Those sacrificial fires were
contained in earthen pots and went in front of Ravana's body.

Shlok 113: All those women of the gynaecium, while weeping, followed at his heels with quick
paces, stumbling, as they were, on all sides.

Shlok 114-115: Keeping the body of Ravana on a consecrated spot, Vibhishana and others, who were
very much afflicted with grief, piled up a sacred pyre, with logs of sandalwood, moistened with
perfumes called Padmaka and Koshira and covered with the skin of black antelopes, turned about to
perform the obsequies in accordance with Vedic rites in honour of the king.

Shlok 116: They performed the ancestral oblations to Ravana in a superb way. They constructed
an altar in the south-east the funeral pile) and placed the sacred fire in its proper place.

Shlok 117: They poured a ladle-full of ghee mixed with curds on his shoulders, placed a cart at
his feet and then a wooden mortar at his thighs.

Shlok 118: Having set at their proper place, all the wooden vessels (used in Agnihotra), the
lower piece of wood used for kindling fire at a sacrifice and the upper piece of wood (which is
rotated at great speed on to lower one, to produce fire by friction), the wooden pestle and other
things used in the sacrifice, they circled around the funeral pyre.

Shlok 119-120: According to ordinance laid down by eminent sages and according to the rules viewed
in Vedas, having sacrificed a goat fit for sacrifice at that spot, the demons dampened with ghee on
Ravana the King of demons.

Shlok 121-122: Having decorated the body of Ravana with perfumes, garlands and various kinds of
clothes; those demons accompanied by Vibhishana, distressed as they were in their minds, poured
parched grains of rice, with their faces bathed in tears.

Shlok 123-125: That Vibhishana set fire to Ravana, according to the rules in the scriptures.
Washing himself and offering in his wet clothes, according to scriptural ordinance, sesame seeds
mixed with water, as well as blades of Kusha grass and offering obeisance to Ravana by bowing his
head, Vibhishana entreated those women to return, consoling them again and again. Then, all of the
returned to the City.

Shlok 126: When those women were re-entering the City, Vibhishana the lord of demons on
approaching Rama's vicinity then remained standing there with humility.

Shlok 127: Having destroyed the enemy, Rama too experienced happiness, along with his army as
well as with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, even as Indra the wielder of thunderbolt did on destroying
Vritra the demon.

Shlok 128: Thereupon, taking off his bow and arrows as also that great armour endowed to him by
Indra, Rama the annihilator of his enemies, taking off his anger too, because of the enemy's
defeat, then obtained a charming benevolence.

[Text] Matali, Indra's charioteer leaves the battle-field and returns to his heaven. Then,
Rama instructs Lakshmana to arrange for the installation of Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.
Lakshmana arranges to get sea-water from some monkey-chiefs and sprinkles it on vibhishana, to
instal him as the King of Lanka, in the presence of the demons there. Then, Rama sends his message
to Seetha through Hanuma.

Shlok 1: Having seen the destruction of Ravana, those gods, celestial musicians and demons,
while chatting about the auspicious narrative, went away in their respective aerial cars.

Shlok 2-3: Chatting themselves about the awful destruction of Ravana, the terrific prowess of
Rama, the admirable combat of the monkeys, the counsel tendered by Sugreeva, the affection and
valour of Lakshmana; the son of Sumitra; the loyaltyof Seetha to her husband and about the strength
of Hanuma, the illustrious celestials and others rejoicingly returned as they had come.

Shlok 4: Taking leave of the celestial chariot, which had been given by Indra the lord of
celestials and which shone like fire, the mighty armed Rama respectfully saluted Matali.

Shlok 5: As assented by Rama, Matali Indra's charioteer, mounting that celestial chariot,
ascended to the heaven itself.

Shlok 6: When Matali ascended to heaven along with his chariot, Rama, the foremost one among
the chariot-warriors was highly rejoiced and embraced Sugreeva.

Shlok 7: Having embraced Sugreeva greeted by Lakshmana and having been honoured by the
monkey-troops. Rama came to the camp where the army had been stationed.

Shlok 8: Then, Rama spoke (as follows) to Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, who was endowed with
strength and having auspicious marks, who stayed nearby.

Shlok 9: "O the benevolent Lakshmana! Consecrate on the throne of Lanka, this Vibhishana to
whom everyone is attached, a loyal person as he is and the one who has formerly done a service to
us."

Shlok 10: "O gentle one! This s my paramount desire that I should see this Vibhishana, the
brother of Ravana being consecrated for throne in Lanka."

Shlok 11: Hearing the words of the great soled Rama, Lakshmana replied, 'so it be' and
rejoicingly procured a golden pot.

Shlok 12: That mighty Lakshmana, then placing that pot in the hands of the monkey-chiefs,
instructed them, who were as swift as thought, to bring sea-water.

Shlok 13: Thereupon, those excellent monkeys, with the swiftness of thought, moving very
quickly from that place, returned, having obtained the water from the sea.

Shlok 14-15: Thereupon, Lakshmana together with his friends, taking one pot and making Vibhishana
to sit on the throne, sprinkled him with sea-water from that pot in accordance with the rule
prescribed in Vedic scriptures, while the demons were witnessing the ceremony, to make him the king
for Lanka, as directed by Rama.

Shlok 16: Then, all the demons as well as the monkeys consecrated Vibhishana. Having gained
extra ordinary delight, they indeed eulogized Rama.

Shlok 17: Seeing Vibhishana the lord of demons consecrated for the throne of Lanka, his four
counsellors who were always together with him and such of those demons who were devoted to him,
were rejoiced.

Shlok 18: Rama together with Lakshmana were greatly delighted. That Vibhishana, having gained
that great kingdom bestowed on him by Rama, was also greatly delighted.

Shlok 19-20: After consoling his people, Vibhishana then sought to presence of Rama. Now, the
demons who were residing in the city were quite delighted and brought to him (by way of presents)
curds, unbroken grains of rice, sweets shaped like balls, parched grains of unhusked rice and
flowers too.

Shlok 21: Accepting them, the valiant and unconquerable Vibhishana happily offered all those
auspicious objects to Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 22: Seeing Vibhishana, who had accomplished his act and increased his resources, Rama
accepted it all, with a sole desire to show gratefulness to him.

Shlok 23: Thereupon, Rama spoke the following words to the valiant Hanuma the monkey who was
equal in size to a mountain and who was standing in humility, with his hands joined in
salutation.

Shlok 24: "O the benevolent one! Taking permission from this Vibhishana, the great king and
entering into the City of Lanka, inform about our welfare to Seetha."

Shlok 25: "O Hanuma, the proficient one in speech! Inform Seetha that myself together with
Lakshmana and Sugreeva are well and that Ravana had been killed in battle."

Shlok 26: "O Hanuma the master of monkeys! Making clear this favourite news to Seetha, you
ought to return, taking back her message."



SARGA 113
------------------------------

[Text] Matali, Indra's charioteer leaves the battle-field and returns to his heaven. Then,
Rama instructs Lakshmana to arrange for the installation of Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.
Lakshmana arranges to get sea-water from some monkey-chiefs and sprinkles it on Vibhishana, to
install him as the King of Lanka, in the presence of the demons there. Then, Rama sends his message
to Seetha through Hanuma.

Shlok 1: Thus directed by Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god, entered deeply into the City of
Lanka, being respectfully received by the demons.

Shlok 2-4: That Hanuma, the monkey, known to Seetha, having entered the City of Lanka, seeking
permission from Vibhishana, getting approval from him and entering Ashoka grove as per the
prevailing regulation, saw at the foot of a tree, Seetha, who was bereft of freshness, looking
joylessly like a frightened cow and surrounded with female-demons. Approaching her humbly by
offering salutation to her in bending his head, he stood there silently.

Shlok 5: Even after seeing the mighty Hanuma who came there, Seetha kept herself silent.
Then, seeing and recollecting him, she became rejoiced.

Shlok 6: Seeing her cool face, Hanuma the excellent monkey began to narrate the entire
message of Rama.

Shlok 7: "O Seetha! Rama is well, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, along with Vibhishana
as his supporter and collectively with the army of monkeys."

Shlok 8: "O the divine lady! Having destroyed his enemy, Rama the annihilator of his
adversaries, having accomplished his object, is informing you about his welfare. Rama and
Lakshmana, with the support of Vibhishana and the monkeys, killed the valiant Ravana."

Shlok 9-10: "O the divine lady! I am telling a pleasant news and again eulogizing you. O Seetha,
the knower of righteousness! Rama accomplished this great victory in the battle, because of your
power. Be free from your grief and be comfortable."

Shlok 11: "Ravana, the enemy was killed. Even the Lanka has been subdued. With a firm
determination to win you back, by me who have had no sleep, a bridge has been constructed across
the great ocean and this vow (of winning you back) has been fulfilled."

Shlok 12: "You ought not to have any fear, living as you do in Ravana's abode. This kingdom of
Lanka has now been placed indeed under the dominion ship of Vibhishana."

Shlok 13: "That is why, console yourself complacently. You are staying in your own house. This
Vibhishana too is coming to you with a rejoice, as he is so eager to see you."

Shlok 14: Hearing these words, that Seetha the divine lady, whose face resembled the moon,
could not speak, tongue-tied as she was with a thrill of delight.

Shlok 15: Thereupon, Hanuma spoke to Seetha, who was not making any answer (as follows): "O
divine lady! What are you reflecting upon? Why don't you speak to me?"

Shlok 16: Thus asked by Hanuma, Seetha, who was ever established in a righteous path, was very
much delighted and spoke (as follows) in a voice choked with tears.

Shlok 17: "Hearing these pleasant tidings about the victory of my husband, I became speechless
for a while, overpowered as I was, by extreme joy."

Shlok 18: "O, Hanuman! I indeed do not see any appropriate thing here, which pleases you in
return, to offer you, who have announced these tidings pleasant to me, even after enervating my
brain."

Shlok 19: "Nor, do I perceive anything worthy for you on this earth for you act of conveying
this agreeable news to me and on bestowing which on you, happiness may come to me."

Shlok 20: "Neither silver, nor gold nor even diamonds nor the sovereignty of the three worlds,
can be worthy of this message."

Shlok 21: Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma standing with his face turned towards Seetha and
with his hands joined in salutation, joyfully replied as follows:

Shlok 22: "O faultless lady, interested in things agreeable and beneficial to husband and
wishing for his victory! You alone deserve to speak such words filled with affection."

Shlok 23: "O gentle lady! These words of yours, endowed with preciousness and affection, are
better than various kinds of collection of diamonds or the sovereignty over the celestials."

Shlok 24: "I see Rama victorious and happy, he having killed the enemies and having obtained
victory. That is to say, I have attained the blessing like the sovereignty over the celestials and
other good qualities."

Shlok 25: Hearing those words of Hanuma, Seetha the daughter of Janaka thereupon spoke the
following auspicious words to Hanuma.

Shlok 26: "You alone can utter these words, endowed with exceedingly good attributes,
embellished with a grace of style and filled with an intelligence, consisting of eight
excellences.*"

[Commentary] *1) Keenness to hear discourse on the Spirit 2) readiness to hear such
discourses, 3) receptivity, 4) retentive power, 5) reasoning for and 6) against a proposition, 7)
the faculty of comprehension and 8) realization of truth: These are the eight characteristics of
good intelligence, according to Neetisara Kamandaka, often quoted by the commentators in Sanskrit:
shushruShaa shravaNaM chaiva | ghruhaNaM dhaaraNaM tathaa | uuhoapehoarthavijJnaanaM |
tattvajJNaanaM cha dhiiguNaaH ||

Shlok 27-28: "You are a praiseworthy and supremely virtuous son of the wind-god. Numerous good
qualities are there in you along (as follows, along with others): strength, valour, knowledge of
scriptures, vigour, prowess, superlative skill (in action), spirit, forbearance, firmness,
stability and re is no humility. There is no doubt about it."

Shlok 29: Thereafter, having joined his hands together in salutation, standing in front of
Seetha in humility and free from flurry, Hanuma again spoke to Seetha (as follows):

Shlok 30: "If you permit me, I wish to kill of all these notorious female-demons, by whom you
have been frightened earlier."

Shlok 31-32: "These cruel female-demons of terrific form and behavior, with still more cruel
eyes, having ugly faces, were heard by me here speaking again and again harsh words to you, who are
so devoted to your husband, at Ravana's command, when you were suffering hardships in the Ashoka
grove, O divine lady!"

Shlok 33-34: "I wish to kill with various kinds of strokes, these cruel, extremely rough and
deformed female-demons, with distorted features and terrific hairs and eyes, talking together
roughly. (Pray) grant this boon to me."

Shlok 35-37: "I wish to kill the female-demons, who have spoken harsh words to you and wronged
you, striking them down with my fists, hand-blows, long arms, blows of my shanks and knees, by
causing pain to their teeth, biting off their ears and nose and pulling out their hair, making them
severely dry-mouthed, tearing them off, leaping over them, encountering them and throwing down
their bodies, with their burst cheeks, necks, shoulders and ribs."

Shlok 38: "O illustrious lady! Striking them with several blows in this way, I would destroy
the female-demons of terrible form, by whom you have been threatened in the past."

Shlok 39: Reflecting as pondering for a while, when spoke thus by Hanuma, the compassionate
Seetha, who was kind to the miserable, spoke to Hanuma as follows:

Shlok 40: "O the foremost of monkey! Who will be angry with servant-maids, who are dependent
on their king's command and work in obedience to the orders of others?"

Shlok 41: "All this is reaped by me, as a consequence of my bad fortune or an account of a
misdeed committed by me in the past. The fruit of one's own making is indeed experienced (in one's
life)."

Shlok 42: "O the great-armed Hanuma! Do not speak like this. This is indeed a great divine
strategy. It was ordained that this type of situation is to be obtained by me, due to the
application of fate. Feeble as I am in these matters, I am forgiving the servant-maids of Ravana
here."

Shlok 43: "O Hanuma! As commanded by Ravana the threatened me. As he is dead now, they will
not do the threatening."

Shlok 44: "O Hanuma! There is an old axim possessed of merit, actually uttered by a bear in
the presence of a tiger. Hear it from me."

Shlok 45: "A superior person does not take into account the sin of those who have committed an
offence evil for evil must be carried out at all costs virtuous persons account good conduct as an
ornament."

[Commentary] Formerly a tiger ran in pursuit of a hunter. The latter climbed up a tree. There
was bear already preached on a bough of the tree. Making to the foot of the tree, the tiger
addressed the following words to the bear: "Look here, both of us are denizens of the forest. The
hunter is our common enemy. Therefore, knock him down from the tree." The bear, however, replied:
"Having reached my abode, the hunter has in a way sought asylum with me. I am therefore not going
to hurl him down; I would be deviating from my duty if I do so." Saying so, the bear laid himself
down to sleep. The tiger now turned to the hunter and said, "Push the bear down. I shall afford
protection to you." The hunter thereupon pushed the sleeping bear. The bear, however, clutched at
another bough and thus escaped from falling down. The tiger now addressed the following appeal to
the bear: "The hunter sought to hurl you down and has thus wronged you. Therefore push him down."
Though pressed by the tiger again and again, the bear refused to hurl him down and repeated the
above quoted verse in support of his attitude.

Shlok 46: "Kindness is to be shown by a noble person either towards a sinner or to a virtuous
person or even to a person who deserves death, for, there is none who never commits a wrong."

Shlok 47: "No evil is to be done, even to those cruel persons of sinful deeds, who take
pleasure to harm the life of others and continue to perpetrate their sinful acts."

Shlok 48: Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma who was skilled in speech, then replied to the
faultless Seetha, Rama's consort (as follows):

Shlok 49: "O divine lady! You are the apt wife of Rama, full of virtue. Give me a message in
return. I will go to the place where Rama is."

Shlok 50: Thus spoken by Hanuma, that Seetha the daughter of Janaka spoke as follows: "O the
foremost of monkeys! I long to see my husband."

Shlok 51: Hearing those words of Seetha, the highly intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god,
bringing delight to Seetha, spoke the following words:

Shlok 52: "You shall see today, Rama whose countenance is like a full moon, whose friends
(like Sugreeva and Vibhishana) are alive, whose enemies have been killed along with Lakshmana, as
Shachi (the consort of Indra) would see Indra the lord of gods."

Shlok 53: Thus speaking to that Seetha, who appeared radiant before his eyes as Lakshmi the
goddess of prosperity, Hanuma of great splendor, came to the place where Rama was.

Shlok 54: Then, Hanuma the excellent of monkeys speedily narrated, in order of sequence, the
message given by Seetha, to Rama who was equal to Indra the chief of celestials.



SARGA 114
------------------------------

[Text] Rama sends Vibhishana to bring Seetha to his presence. Vibhishana brings Seetha to
Rama's presence. Seetha casts her looks on the moon-like face of Rama, her beloved husband.

Shlok 1: Having offered his salutation to that Rama, who was excellent among all the wielders
of the bow and whose eyes resembled the lotus-petals, that highly intelligent Hanuma spoke to him
as follows:

Shlok 2: "You ought to see Seetha that divine lady who is consumed by grief, for whose sake
this course of actions was undertaken and which has (now) borne fruit."

Shlok 3: "Hearing the news of your victory, that Seetha, stricken as she was with grief, is
now longing to see you, her eyes filled with tears of joy."

Shlok 4: "By her, who has trust in me because of confidence which has trust in me because of
confidence which had been inspired me on a former occasion, I was spoken as follows: 'I desire to
see my husband, who has accomplished his purpose, together with Lakshmana.'"

Shlok 5: Hearing Hanuma's words, Rama who was the foremost among the supporters of
righteousness, was a little over whelmed with tears and suddenly became a bit thoughtful.

Shlok 6: Drawing a deep and warm breath and casting his looks on the ground, he spoke (as
follows) to Vibhishana, who closely resembled a cloud in hue and who was standing nearby.

Shlok 7: "Bring here Seetha, after she has bathed her head, has been anointed with charming
cosmetics and adorned with beautiful jewels. Let there be no delay."

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana, after entering the gynaecium in haste,
communicated his presence to Seetha, through his own women.

Shlok 9: Then, the glorious Vibhishana the king of demons, after seeing the highly fortunate
Seetha, with his palms joined over his head, humbly spoke to her as follows:

Shlok 10: "O Seetha! Anointed with charming cosmetics and adorned with beautiful jewels if you
please, mount on the vehicle. Your husband wants to see you."

Shlok 11: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, replied as follows: "O king of demons! I wish to
see my husband, even without taking my bath."

Shlok 12: Hearing those words of Seetha, Vibhishana replied as follows: "You ought to do the
bidding of Rama, your husband, as he has enjoined you to do."

Shlok 13: Hearing those words of Vibhishana, the virtuous Seetha, regarding her husband as a
divinity, endowed as she was with a devotion to her husband, said in reply, "So t be!"

Shlok 14-15: Prevailing upon Seetha to ascend a shining palanquin, covered with an exceedingly
valuable cloth and guarded by numerous demons, after she had bathed her head and cleansed her body,
had put on costly robes and had been adorned with exceedingly valuable jewels, Vibhishana then
brought her to the presence of Rama.

Shlok 16: Approaching the great-souled Rama, who was absorbed in thought, even after coming to
know that Seetha had arrived, Vibhishana offered his obeisance and with full of great joy,
announced to him that Seetha had arrived.

Shlok 17: Hearing that Seetha had arrived after living long in the abode of a demon, Rama was
filled with joy, indignation and felt miserable too all the three emotions at the same time.

Shlok 18: Feeling unhappy on considering with deep thought, the question of Seetha having come
in a palanquin, all the way, Rama then spoke the following words, looking at Vibhishana who was
beside him.

Shlok 19: "O the gently king of demons, who is forever intent on my victory! Let Seetha duly
seek my presence quickly."

Shlok 20: Hearing those words of that Rama, Vibhishana, who knew what was right, began to
disperse the crowd there quickly.

Shlok 21: Demons wearing jackets and turbans, their hands carrying staffs which made a
jingling sound, walked there all round, dispersing those warriors.

Shlok 22: Crowds of bears, monkeys and demons, dispersed on all sides, bounced for a distance,
from their nearness to the palanquin.

Shlok 23: While those warriors were being driven away, there was a very great sound,
resembling the roar of a sea, lashed by a storm.

Shlok 24: Seeing them being dispersed on all sides excited, Rama then stopped that operation
of those who were dispersing them, out of kindness (for those who were being driven away) and
resentment (at the behaviour of the demons who were dispersing them).

Shlok 25: The enraged Rama, consuming the demons with his looks as it were, Rama spoke the
following reproaching words to the highly intelligent Vibhishana

Shlok 26: "Why disregarding me, are these people harassed by you? Stop this exertion. They are
my own people."

Shlok 27: "An apartment is not a thing that protects a woman, nor robes, nor compound-walls,
nor concealments nor such royal honours. Her character is her shield."

Shlok 28: "A woman becoming visible to public in times of a calamity is not condemned in
difficult situations, nor in battles, nor in self-choosing of a husband by a princess at a public
assembly of suitors, nor in sacrificial ceremonies nor in marriage-functions."

Shlok 29: "The younder Seetha is in distress and beset with a great difficulty. There is no
fault in her appearance in public, particularly in my presence."

Shlok 30: "That is why, let her come on foot alone, leaving the palanquin there. Let these
monkeys see Seetha in my presence."

Shlok 31: Hearing the words of Rama the intelligent Vibhishana, with decency, brought Seetha
to Rama's vicinity.

Shlok 32: Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana Sugreeva and Hanuma the monkey then felt very
much perturbed.

Shlok 33: From the pitiless facial features of Rama, showing indifference to his consort, they
conjectured as if Rama had some displeasure towards Seetha.

Shlok 34: Seetha, for her part, shrinking into her limbs with modesty, approached her husband,
duly followed by Vibhishana.

Shlok 35: The pleasant-faced Seetha, who considered her husband as the divinity, saw the
charming face of her husband, with a surprise, rejoice and affection.

Shlok 36: Seeing the face of her beloved husband, which had not been seen for a long time and
which was charming like the rising full moon, she forth dispelled her mental fatigue.



SARGA 115
------------------------------

[Text] Rama informs Seetha that the dishonour meted out to him and the wrong done to her by
Ravana have been wiped off, by his victory over the enemy with the assistance of Hanuma, Sugreeva
and Vibhishana. However, regarding with suspicion the character of Seetha, Rama disowns her and
asks her to seek shelter elsewhere.

Shlok 1: Seeing that Seetha, who stood at his vicinity bowing low, Rama began to tell his
feeling hidden in his heart (as follows):

Shlok 2: "You are won back by me, after conquering the enemy in the battle-field, my dear
lady! That which is to be done through human effort, has been accomplished by me."

Shlok 3: "I have come to the end of my indignation and my outrage has been completely
requited as also the contempt against the enemy have been wiped out, all at once, by me."

Shlok 4: "Now, my manly strength has been seen by all. Today, my toil has borne fruit. Now, I
have fulfilled my promise. Today, I am the master of myself."

Shlok 5: "The wrong done to you, when you were deserted from me, in that you were taken away
by a fickle-minded demon, which was ordained by the destiny, has been corrected by me as a human
being."

Shlok 6: "What is the use of a prowess, however great, of that weak-minded man who does not
wipe out, by his energy, the insult fallen to his lot?"

Shlok 7: "The praise-worthy act of Hanuma in the form of crossing of the ocean and the
destroying of Lanka, has borne fruit today."

Shlok 8: "The endeavour of Sugreeva, who exhibited his prowess on the battle-field with his
army and tendered a good advice, is fruitful today."

Shlok 9: "Furthermore, the exertion of Vibhishana, who after deserting his brother who was
void of good qualities, sought my presence, is fruitful today.

Shlok 10: Hearing those words spoken thus by Rama, Seetha with her eyes wide open like those
of a female-deer, was bathed in tears.

Shlok 11: The heart of King Rama, as he saw Seetha, (the beloved of his heart) near him, was
torn for fear of public scandal.

Shlok 12: In the midst of monkeys and demons, Rama spoke (as follows) to Seetha, whose eyes
resembled the petals of a lotus, who wore dark curly hair and was endowed with fine hips.

Shlok 13: "I, wanting for an honour, have done this particular act, which ought to be done by
a man, in killing Ravana and thus wiping away the insult meted out to me."

Shlok 14: "You have been won by me, whose mind stands purified by asceticism as the southern
quarter, which was difficult to be approached by the world of mortals, was conquered by the Sage
Agastya."

Shlok 15-16: "Let it be known to you that this endeavor in the shape of war, which has been
successful carried through, due to the strength of my friends was not undertaken for your sake. Let
there be prosperity to you! This was done by me in order to keep up my good conduct and to wipe off
the evil-speaking from all sides as well as the insinuation on my own illustrious dynasty."

Shlok 17: "You, with a suspicion arisen on your character, standing in front of me, are
extremely disagreeable to me, even as a light to one, who is suffering from a poor eye-sight."

Shlok 18: "O Seetha! That is why, I am permitting you now. Go wherever you like. All these ten
directions are open to you, my dear lady! There is no work to be done to me, by you."

Shlok 19: "Which noble man, born in an illustrious race, will take back a woman who lived in
another's abode, with an eager mind?"

Shlok 20: "While mentioning greatly about my lineage, how can I accept again, you who were
harassed in Ravana's lap (while being borne away by him) and who were seen (by him) with evil
looks?"

Shlok 21: "You were won by me with that end in view (viz. the retrieval of my lost honour).
The honour has been restored by me. For me, there is no intense attachment in you. You may go
wherever you like from here."

Shlok 22: "O gracious lady! Therefore, this has been spoken by me today, with a resolved mind.
Set you mind on Lakshmana or Bharata, as per your ease."

Shlok 23: "O Seetha! Otherwise, set your mind either on Shatrughna or on Sugreeva or on
Vibhishana the demon; or according to your own comfort."

Shlok 24: "Seeing you, who are endowed with a beautiful form and attractive to the sense,
detained for long in his abode, Ravana could not have endured your separation."

Shlok 25: Hearing that unpalatable speech of her beloved husband, Seetha who used to hear
pleasing words alone, was very much trembled for long, like a creeper attacked by the proboscis of
an elephant and thereupon shed tears.



SARGA 116
------------------------------

[Text] Seetha gives a taunting reply to Rama, saying that why she was not abandoned by the
latter, even at the time when Hanuma came to see her in Lanka. Then, Seetha requests Lakshmana to
prepare a pile of fire for her to enter. When Lakshmana prepares a pyre, Seetha prays the fire-god
and enters into it, in order toprove her conjugal fidelity.

Shlok 1: Hearing the harsh words with indignation, spoken by Rama, which caused her hair to
stand on end, Seetha became very much perturbed.

Shlok 2: Hearing the terrific words of her husband, which were never actually heard by her
before, amidst a large gathering of people, Seetha stood bent low with shame.

Shlok 3: As though her own limbs were pierced by those words, which were arrow-like with
pointed splinters, Seetha shed profuse tears.

Shlok 4: Then, wiping clean her face, which was bathed in tears, she spoke the following
words slowly, in a stammering voice to her husband.

Shlok 5: "O valiant Rama! Why are you speaking such harsh words, which are violent to hear
for me, like a common man speaking to a common woman?"

Shlok 6: "O the long-armed one! I am not the one in the way you understand me. Have a faith
in me. I swear to you by my own character."

Shlok 7: "By the conduct of vulgar woman you distrust the entire race of women. Give up this
doubt, if I have been actually tested (and found trustworthy) by you."

Shlok 8: "O lord! It was not my willfulness, when I came into contact with the person of
Ravana. I was helpless. My adverse fate was to blame on that score."

Shlok 9: "My heart, which was subservient to me, was abiding in you. What could I do,
helpless as I was, with regard to my limbs which had fallen under the sway of another?"

Shlok 10: "O bestower of honour! If I could not be fully known to you, in spite of our love
having simultaneously grown and despite of our having lived together, I am ruined permanently by
such ignorance."

Shlok 11: "O king! Hanuma, the great hero, was sent by you as your search-agent. Why I, who
was still in Lanka, was not abandoned then itself?"

Shlok 12: "O hero! Life would have been given up by me, when deserted by you; immediately on
hearing the message (conveying your desertion) before the eyes of the monkey."

Shlok 13: "This wasteful endeavour (in the form of crossing over to Lanka and waging war
against the mighty Ravana, keeping your life in jeopardy), would not have been there, nor would
have your friends been put to such fruitless hardship."

Shlok 14: "O excellent king! You, however, like a feeble man, gave priority to womanliness,
conforming yourself to just an emotion of anger."

Shlok 15: "O knower of virtuous conduct! My birth was from Janaka in disguise; but was
actually from the earth. My sacred birth of such a high degree, was not honoured by you."

Shlok 16: "My hand taken (by you as a bride) in our childhood was not duly recognized by you.
My devotion, my chastity and all have been ignored by you."

Shlok 17: Seetha, thus speaking, weeping and stammering with tears, said to Lakshmana, who was
sad and engaged in thoughtfulness (as follows):

Shlok 18: "O Lakshmana! Create a pile of fire, for me, which is a remedy for this disaster. I
no longer wish to survive, smitten as am with false blames."

Shlok 19: "I will enter a fire, to obtain the only course appropriate for me, who has been
abandoned amidst an assembly of men, by my husband who was not satisfied with my traits."

Shlok 20: Hearing the words of Seetha, Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemy warriors, giving way
to wrath, looked towards Rama.

Shlok 21: Understanding the inclination of the mind of Rama, hinted by the expression in his
face, that valiant Lakshmana prepared a pyre, in deference to the wishes of Rama.

Shlok 22: No one near and dear was indeed able to cajole on that occasion or to speak or even
to look upon Rama, who appeared like Yama the lord of death at the time of dissolution of the
world.

Shlok 23: Thereupon, Seetha, after doing circumambulation to Rama, who was standing with his
head bent low, proceeded towards the blazing fire.

Shlok 24: Having offered salutation to gods and brahmins as also having joined her palms in
the vicinity of the fire, Seetha spoke the following words:

Shlok 25: "As my heart never moves off from Rama, so let the fire-god, the witness of the
world, protect me from all sides."

Shlok 26: "As Rama apprehends me, though of unimpeachable conduct, to be spoilt, let the
fire-god the witness of the world protect me from all sides."

Shlok 27: "As I have never been unfaithful in act, thought and speech to Rama, who knows all
the virtues, so let the fire-god protect me."

Shlok 28: "Since the adorable sun-god, wind-god, the four quarters and even so the moon-god,
as also the deity presiding over the day-time and the twilights and the night and the earth and
even others know me to be endowed with good conduct, so let the fire-god protect me."

Shlok 29: Thus speaking, Seetha walking around the fire-god, with her mind free from
hesitation, entered the blazing fire.

Shlok 30: A large gathering of men including children and elders, saw the shining Seetha
having entered the fire there.

Shlok 31: That Seetha, with the shining of fresh refined gold and decked with ornaments of
refined gold, plunged into the blazing fire, in the presence of all people.

Shlok 32: All the living beings saw then that wide-eyed Seetha, who looked like a golden
altar, plunging into the fire.

Shlok 33: The sages, gods, and the Gandharvas saw that illustrious Seetha entering deep into
the fire as a sacred oblation of clarified butter.

Shlok 34: All the women (who were present there) screamed on seeing her, rushing into the
fire, like a gush of clarified butter plunging into the sacrificial fire, duly consecrated by Vedic
hymns.

Shlok 35: The denizens of the entire three worlds including the gods, Gandharvas and demons,
beheld her falling into the fire, like a goddess, subjected to a curse, falling from heaven to
hell.

Shlok 36: While she was entering deeply into the fire, a loud sound, which appeared strange,
uttering 'Alas, Alas' rose both from the demons and the monkeys alike.



SARGA 117
------------------------------

[Text] Gods reach Lanka in aerial cars and approach Rama. They ask Rama why he ignores
Seetha, when she is entering into the fire. Rama appeals them to describe in reality who he is.
Brahma (the creator) proclaims his divinity and eulogizes him with hymns.

Shlok 1: Hearing the cries of these who were thus wailing, the virtuous minded Rama then
became thoughtful for a while, afflicted as he was with melancholy, his eyes filled with tears.

Shlok 2-4: Thereupon, Kubera the King of Yakshas, Yama the lord of death together with the
deceased ancestors, Indra the lord of celestials Varuna the lord of waters, the illustrious Shiva
the great deity who bears the device of a bull as his banner and having three eyes, Brahma the
creator of all the worlds and the best among the knowers of sacred knowledge all these together
reaching the City of Lanka in aerial cars, shining like the sun approached Rama.

Shlok 5: Lifting their long arms, their hands decked with ornaments, those excellent gods
thereupon, spoke (as follows) to Rama who stood there, making a respectful salutation to them with
his folded hands.

Shlok 6: "How do you, the maker of the entire cosmos, the foremost among those endowed with
knowledge and an all-capable person, ignore Seetha who is falling into the fire? How do you not
recognize yourself to be the foremost of the troop of gods?"

Shlok 7: "Among the Vasus (a class of gods, eight in number), you are the Vasu, named
R^itadhama (one whose abode is Truth or the Divine Law) who was formerly the self-constituted
ruler, the first creator of all the three worlds and the lord of creatures."

Shlok 8: "You are the eighth Rudra among (eleven) Rudras and the fifth (Viryavan by name)
among the Sadhyas (a particular class of celestials belonging to Gana Devata). The twin Aswinis are
your ears. The sun and the moon constitute your eyes."

Shlok 9: "O the destroyer of the adversaries. You are seen (to exist) at the beginning and at
the end of creation. Yet, you ignore Seetha, just like a common man."

Shlok 10: Hearing the words of those guardians of the world, Rama, the lord of creation, who
was born in Raghu dynasty and the foremost one among protectors of righteousness, spoke to those
god-chiefs as follows:

Shlok 11: "I think of myself to be a human being, by name Rama, the son of Dasaratha. You, as
a gracious Divinity, tell me that which I as such really am like this."

Shlok 12: Hearing the words of Rama, Brahma (the creator), the foremost among the knowers of
Brahma the Absolute, spoke as follows: "Listen to my true word, O the truly brave lord!"

Shlok 13: "You are the Lord Narayana himself the glorious god, who wields the discus. You are
the Divine Boar with a single tusk, the conqueror of your past and future enemies."

Shlok 14: "You are Brahma, the imperishable, the Truth abiding in the middle as well as at the
end of the universe. You are the supreme righteousness of people, whose powers go everywhere. You
are the four-armed."

Shlok 15: "You are the wielder of a bow called Sarnga, the lord of the senses, the supreme
soul of the universe, the best of men, the invincible, the wielder of a sword named Nandaka, the
all-pervader, the bestower of happiness to the earth and endowed with great might."

Shlok 16: "You are the leader of the army and the village headman. You are the intellect. You
are the endurance and the subduer of the senses. You are the origin and the dissolution of all,
Upendra the Divine Dwarf and (the younger brother of Indra) as also the destroyer Madhu, the
demon."

Shlok 17: "You perform action for Indra the lord of celestials, the Supreme Ruler, the one
having a lotus in one's navel and who puts an end to all in battle. The divine sages pronounce you
to be fit to afford protection to all and the refuge for all."

Shlok 18-19: "In the form of the Vedas, you are the great Bull with hundred heads (rules) and
thousand horns (precepts). You are the first creator of all, the three worlds, and the self
constituted Lord of all. You are the refuge and the forbear of Siddhas (a class of demi-gods
endowed with mystic powers by virtue of their very birth) and Sadhyas (a class of celestial
beings.)"

Shlok 20: "You are the sacrificial performance. You are the sacred syllable 'Vashat' (on
hearing which the Adhvaryu priest casts the oblation to a deity into the sacrificial fire). You are
the mystic syllable 'OM'. You are higher than the highest. People neither know your end nor your
origin nor who you are in reality."

Shlok 21: "You appear in all created beings in the cattle and in brahmanas. You exist in all
quarters, in the sky, in mountains and in rivers."

Shlok 22: "With thousand feet, with hundred heads and with thousand eyes along with Lakshmi
the goddess of wealth, you bear the earth with all its created beings along with its
mountains."

Shlok 23: "O Rama! You appear as Sesha, a large serpent in water, at the earth's bottom,
bearing the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas, the celestial musicians and the demons."

Shlok 24: "O Rama! I (brahma) am your heart. Saraswathi, the goddess (of learning) is your
tongue. O lord! The gods created by Brahma are the hair on all your limbs."

Shlok 25: "Night has been recognized as the closing of your eye-lids and the day, as the
opening of eye-lids. The correct usages of your words are the Vedas. Bereft of you, this visible
universe does not exist."

Shlok 26: "The entire cosmos is your body. The earth constitutes your firmness. Fire is your
anger. The moon constitutes your placidity. You are Lord Vishnu (who bears the mark Srivatsa - a
curl of white hair on his breast)."

Shlok 27: "In the past, the three worlds were occupied by you in your three strides, after
binding the exceptionally formidable Bali (the ruler of the three worlds) and Indra was made the
king (by you)."

Shlok 28: "Seetha is no other than Goddess Lakshmi (the divine consort of Lord Vishnu), while
you are Lord Vishnu. You are having a shining dark-blue hue. You are the Lord of created beings.
For the destruction of Ravana, you entered a human body here, on this earth."

Shlok 29: "O Rama, the foremost among the supporters of righteousness! The aforesaid purpose
of ours has been fulfilled. Ravana has been killed. Return to your divine abode, with a
rejoice."

Shlok 30: "O Lord! Unerring is your valour. Your exploits are never in vain. O Rama! Your
blessed sight is powerful. The songs in praise of you never go in vain."

Shlok 31-32: "Those humans who are full of devotion to you will never be unsuccessful on this
earth. Those who are devoted to you, the primeval and the eternal lord, belonging to ancient times
and the Supreme Person, will forever attain their desired objects here as well as hereafter."

Shlok 33: "Humiliation will never be the plight of those humans who will recite this hymn in a
divine ancient history, sung by Brahma, the foremost seer."



SARGA 118
------------------------------

[Text] The fire-god appears in person from the burning pyre, carrying Seetha in his arms
and restores her to Rama, testifying to her purity. Rama later joyfully accepts her.

Shlok 1: Hearing the foregoing auspicious words of Brahma (the creator), the fire-god came
up, taking Seetha in his arms.

Shlok 2: Shaking off that funeral pile and taking that Seetha, the daughter of Janaka in his
arms, the fire-god forthwith sprang up at once in a personified form.

Shlok 3-4: Bearing in his arms the youthful Seetha, who was shining brightly as the rising sun,
was decked in ornaments of refined gold, attired in a red robe and wore dark curly hair, who was
further adorned with ornaments of flowers, which had not abraded (on her entering the fire and
coming out of it), who was absolutely beyond reproach and looked just the same (as she did while
entering the fire and coming out of it), who was absolutely beyond reproach and looked just the
same (as she did while entering the flames), the fire-god restored her to Rama.

Shlok 5: Then, the fire-god, the witness of the whole world, spoke to Rama as follows "Here
is your Seetha. No sin exists in her."

Shlok 6: "This auspicious lady, whose character has been good, has never been unfaithful to
you who are endowed with strength of character either by word or by mind or even by intellect or by
her glances."

Shlok 7: "Separated from you, this miserable and helpless lady, was taken away by Ravana the
demon, who was arrogant of his valour, from a lonely hermitage."

Shlok 8: "This Seetha, who was fixing her mind upon you ad looking on you as her final
attainment, was detained in the gynaecium and hidden there. She was guarded by rightful
female-demons with horrible intellect."

Shlok 9: "Seetha, whose mind was directed towards you, ignored that demon even though allured
and frightened through various means."

Shlok 10: "Take back Seetha, who is sinless, with a pure character. She should not be told
anything harsh. I hereby command you."

Shlok 11: Rama, the excellent among the eloquent, whose mind was set on virtue, with a
pleasant mind to hear the aforesaid speech, reflected for a while, his eyes, entirely filed with
tears of joy.

Shlok 12: Hearing those words, the courageous Rama of great prowess and the foremost of those
upholding the virtue, replied to the fire-god, the best of gods.

Shlok 13: "Seetha certainly deserves this pure factory ordeal in the eyes of the people in as
much as this blessed woman had resided for a long time indeed in the gynaecium of Ravana.

Shlok 14: "The world would chatter against me, saying that Rama, the son of Dasaratha, was
really foolish and that his mind was dominated by lust, if I accept Seetha without examining her
with regard to her chastity."

Shlok 15: "I also know that Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who ever revolves in my mind, is
undivided in her affection to me."

Shlok 16: "Ravana could not violate this wide-eyed woman, protected as she was by her own
splendour, any more than an ocean would transgress its bounds."

Shlok 17: "In order to convince the three worlds, I, whose refugee is truth, ignored Seetha
while she was entering the fire."

Shlok 18: "The evil-minded Ravana was not able to lay his violent hands, even in thought, o
the unobtainable Seetha, who was blazing like a flaming tongue of fire."

Shlok 19: "This auspicious woman could not give way to the sovereignty, existing in the
gynaecium of Ravana, in as much as Seetha is not different from me, even as sunlight is not
different from the sun."

Shlok 20: "Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, is completely pure in her character, in all the
three worlds and can no longer be renounced by me, as a good name cannot be cast aside by a prudent
man."

Shlok 21: The salutary advice of you all, the affectionate guardians of the world, who are
saying what is conducive to our good, must be certainly carried out by me."

Shlok 22: Saying thus and getting reunited with her beloved Seetha, the victorious and highly
illustrious Rama, a scion of Raghu dynasty, who was endowed with a great strength and deserved
happiness and was being glorified by his exploits, performed by his own self, experienced joy.



SARGA 119
------------------------------

[Text] Lord Shiva informs Rama that his father, Dasaratha, in an ethereal form and as a
replica of his extinct personality, has arrived in an aerial car along with Indra, the lord of
celestials. Shiva asks Rama and Lakshmana to pay their respects to the soul of Dasaratha and they
respond in approaching him and offer their salutations. Dasaratha says he is overjoyed in seeing
him, having defeated Ravana and having completed the exile for fourteen years. He asks Rama to
return to Ayodhya, meet Bharata and get consecrated to the throne of Ayodhya. Dasaratha further
advises Lakshmana and Seetha to continue to serve Rama, the supreme deity. Dasaratha returns to the
abode of Indra, by the aerial car.

Shlok 1: Hearing the auspicious words thus spoken by Rama, Lord Shiva the Supreme Lord
thereupon delivered the following still more beautiful speech:

Shlok 2: "O lotus-eyed, long-armed, broad-chested, annihilator of enemies and excellent among
those upholding the cause of virtue! Thank heaven! You accomplished this task."

Shlok 3: "Fortunately has the fear born of Ravana - which increased the severe darkness on
the entire world has been removed by you, on the battle-field, O Rama!"

Shlok 4-6: "You are fit to go to the heaven, by comforting the depressed Bharata and the
illustrious Kausalya as well as seeing Kaikeyi and Sumitra, the mother of Lakshmana having got the
sovereignty of Ayodhya, bringing delight to your friends, stabilizing the back-bone in the race of
Ikshvaku, getting excellent glory by performing a horse-sacrifice and by granting riches to
Brahmanas."

Shlok 7: "This king Dasaratha, your father in this mortal world and the highly glorious as
well as the venerable person, is seated in an aerial car, O Rama!"

Shlok 8: "Having been delivered by you, his (godly) son, the glorious king obtained the abode
of Indra the lord of celestials. you offer your respectful salutation to him, along with Lakshmana,
your brother."

Shlok 9: Hearing the words of Shiva, Rama along with Lakshmana his brother, offered their
salutation to their father, seated on the topmost part of an aerial car.

Shlok 10: The lord Rama along with Lakshmana his brother saw their father, who was blazing
with his own splendour and clad in brilliant garments.

Shlok 11-12: Then the king Dasaratha the lord who was sitting in the aerial car, in an excellent
seat, was filled with excessive delight to see his son (Rama), who was dearer to him than life.
Placing him in his lap and embracing him in his arms, he thereupon commenced his speech as
follows:

Shlok 13: "O Rama! Separated from you, the heaven is not a liking to me, nor the respect given
to me by the foremost of celestials. I am telling you the truth."

Shlok 14: "Today, there is a great joy for me, for having seen you, fully satisfied in your
mind, now that your enemies have been destroyed and you have fully gone through the period of
exile."

Shlok 15: "O excellent among the eloquent! The words, which were uttered by Kaikeyi, with an
aim to send you into exile, are still imprinted in my heart."

Shlok 16: "Seeing you in a fine fettle with Lakshmana and hugging you today, I stand
completely rid of sorrow - even as the sun is freed from mist."

Shlok 17: "O great-souled son! I have been redeemed by you, my worthy son, even as Kahola a
brahmana was redeemed by Ashtavakra."

Shlok 18: "O gently one! I recognize you now to be the Supreme person, duly enjoined here by
the rulers of gods, for the destruction of Ravana."

Shlok 19: "Blessed indeed is Kausalya, who will see you, the destroyer of your enemies,
returned home from the forest."

Shlok 20: "Blessed indeed are those men, who will see you returned to the City of Ayodhya and
consecrated on the throne as a lord of the earth."

Shlok 21: "I desire to see you, re-united with the mighty Bharata, who is affectionate towards
you, honest and virtuous."

Shlok 22: "O gentle one! You spent fourteen years, residing in the forest with Lakshmana and
Seetha."

Shlok 23: "You completed the term of your exile. My pledge was implemented by you. The
celestials too have been fully gratified, by your killing of Ravana in battle."

Shlok 24: "O the destroyer of enemies! A laudable act has been done and glory has been earned
by you. Getting consecrated on the throne, may you attain a long life, along with your
brothers."

Shlok 25: To Dasaratha, who was thus speaking, Rama with joined palms in salutation, submitted
(as follows): "Be gracious to Kaikeyi and Bharata, O the knower of virtues!"

Shlok 26: You will remember those words spoken by you saying, I disown you, with your son
(Bharata)'. May that terrific curse not touch Kaikeyi and her son, O Lord!"

Shlok 27: Saying 'May it be" to Rama who stood with joined palms embraced Lakshmana. Dasaratha
again uttered the following words to Lakshmana:

Shlok 28: "A great gratification has been rendered to me and reward in the form of religious
merit earned by you in that you served Rama and Seetha, the princess of Videha kingdom, with
devotion."

Shlok 29: "Rama, being pleased with you, you will attain religious merit and extensive glory
on earth, as also heaven and excellent power O knower of righteousness!"

Shlok 30: "Happiness to you, O the augmentor of the joy of Sumitra, your mother! Serve Rama
well. Rama forever is intent on advancing the interests of the entire world."

Shlok 31: "These three worlds, including Indra Siddhas (a class of demi-gods) and great sages
pay homage to the great-souled Rama as a Supreme person, on approaching him."

Shlok 32: "O great one! O the destroyer of adversaries! Rama has been spoken of as the
unmanifest and the imperishable Brahama (the absolute), established by the Vedas, the heart of gods
and the secret of all gods."

Shlok 33: "Having served him, along with Seetha with devotion, you obtained the reward of the
practice of all virtues as also celebrity, abundantly."

Shlok 34: Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the (former) king, addressing his daughter-in-law
standing before him with joined palms as "My daughter", slowly and affectionately advised her as
follows:

Shlok 35: "No wrath indeed should be rendered by you towards Rama, for having repudiated you.
This has been done by him, wishing for your welfare and in order to demostrate your purity."

Shlok 36: "This act (of entering into fire) which has been done by you and which reveals your
true character, my daughter, is the most difficult task to perform for other ladies and will
overshadow their illustriousness."

Shlok 37: "You need not be instructed about the matter of rendering service to your husband.
But, it is to be told certainly by me. He is your supreme deity."

Shlok 38: Having instructed thus to his sons and Seetha, the King Dasaratha who was born in
Raghu dynasty went to the abode of Indra, the lord of celestials, by an aerial car.

Shlok 39: With a satisfied self, Dasaratha the excellent king of noble-mindedness endowed with
splendour, taking leave of his sons and Seetha and mounting the aerial car, went to the abode of
Indra, the chief of gods.

[Text] When Indra the lord of celestials asks Rama for a boon, Rama requested Indra to
bring back to life, all the monkeys who had lost their life in the battle. Indra grants the boon
and all the dead monkeys are restored to life. The celestials disperse and the whole army of
monkeys enjoy their well-earned rest.

Shlok 1: When Dasaratha returned, the Lord Indra, the destroyer of Paka the demon, was very
much pleased and spoke to Rama, who stood there with his oined palms.

Shlok 2: "O Rama, the foremost among men! Your sight of us, should not go in vain. Therefore,
tell us whatever is desired by you."

Shlok 3: Hearing the words of the great souled Indra the lord of celestials, after having
been pleased, Rama with the most placid mind spoke the following words with rejoice:

Shlok 4: "O the foremst among the eloquent! O Indra! If you have affection in me, I shall
speak out my words. Make my words real."

Shlok 5: "Let all the monkeys, who reached the abode of death, after displaying their
energyfor

Shlok 6: "O the bestower of honour! I wish to see all those monkeys, who for my sake, were
removed from their sons and wives, be delighted at heart."

Shlok 7: "They were all valiant, proving their energies and did not take their death into
account. They made their strenuous efforts and died. O Indra! Restore their lives to them."

Shlok 8: "Those mokeys - who coutned death as nothing and who were fond of doing favour to me
- let them get re-united with their near and dear ones by your grace. I seek this boon of you."

Shlok 9: "O bestower of honour! I wish to see the monkeys and bears, free from wounds and
pains, with augmented strength and valour."

Shlok 10: "Wherever the aforesaid monkeys live, let there be rivers with crystal-clear water,
flowers, roots and fruits even in an off-season."

Shlok 11: Hearing the words of that great-souled Rama, Indra the lord of celestials endowed as
he was with delight, again spoke the following words:

Shlok 12: "O beloved Rama! This boon, which has been sought by you is hard to grant. No offer
has, however, been revised by me in the past. Therefore this will come to be."

Shlok 13: "Let all those monkeys and bears along with long-tailed monkeys, who have been
killed in battle, by the demons and whose heads and arms have been severed, be alive and active
again."

Shlok 14: "Without any ill-health andwounds and with boosted strength and valour, the monkeys
will srise again, as those fallen asleep would do at the end of their sleep."

Shlok 15: "All of them, full of delight, will get re-united with their friends, relatives,
kinsmen and family members."

Shlok 16: "O the wielder of a great bow! The trees will look colourful with flowers and fruits
even in the off-season. Rivers too will remain constantly with water."

Shlok 17: Thereupon, all those monkey-warriors got up, as if from a sleep, with all their
limbs completely healed of wounds. All the monkeys felt surprised, saying to one another "What
miracle is this?"

Shlok 18: Seeing Rama, whose wish has been fully realised, all the foremost of celestials,
with a great delight, spoke praisingly to Rama and Lakshmana:

Shlok 19: "O monarch! Proceed to Ayodhya from here and disband the monkeys. Reassure this
illustrious and devoted Seetha."

Shlok 20-21: "O destroyer of adversaries! See Bharata, your brother, who is practising
austerities through grief caused by separation from you, the great-souled Shatrughna and all your
mohters. Get yourself consecrated on the throne. Bring rejoice to the citizens, by going
there."

Shlok 22: Thus speaking to Rama and Lakshmana, Idnra the thousand-eyed god of celestials,
having beenpleased, returned to heaven with other gods in their aerial cars, shining liek the
sun.

Shlok 23: having respectfully saluted all those celestials, Rama along with Lakshmana his
brother, then instructed all the monkeys to take rest in their respective places.

Shlok 24: Thereupon, that illustrious and mighty army of rejoiced troops, for its part, whichw
as protected by Lakshmana and Rama, and was blazing with splendour on all sides, shone brightly
like the might, illumined by the moon.

[Text] Rama prepares to leave for Ayodhya. Even though Vibhishana requests Rama to remain
at Lanka for some more time and receive his hospitality, Rama gently refuses to do so, adding that
he needs to proceed to Ayodhya quickly, to see his mothers, brothers and people there. Vibhishana
arranges the aerial car, Pushpaka to transport Rama and others to Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: Vibhishana, wishing victory to Rama, (the destroyer of adversaries) who having
reposed during the previous night and had risen fresh, spoke to him with joined palms, the
following words:

Shlok 2-3: "These women with lotus-like eyes, who are skilled in the art of decoration, came
with bathing accessories like garments, ornaments, sandal-pastes and beautiful garlands of various
kinds. They will assist you in bathing O Rama!"

Shlok 4: Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Rama replied as follows: "You invite the monkeys
headed by Sugreeva for the bath."

Shlok 5: "That Bharata, the virtuous man, who was accustomed to comfort, a delicate youth,
the great-armed and the one consistent with the truth is suffering on my account."

Shlok 6: In the absence of Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, who is practicing virtue, ritual
bathing, garments and jewels are not to my liking."

Shlok 7: "See how we may return to that City of Ayodhya soon. It is indeed very difficult to
travel over this path to reach Ayodhya City, so soon."

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana replied : "O prince! I will get you t that
City in a day."

Shlok 9-10: "O Rama of unequalled prowess! The aerial car shining like the sun, which moves as
one pleases, wonderful and excellent, named Pushpaka of Kubera my brother was robbed by the mighty
Ravana after conquering Kubera in battle. May prosperity attend you! It is retained there for your
sake."

Shlok 11: "The yonder aerial car, looking like a cloud, stands here and by which transport,
you can reach Ayodhya without any trouble."

Shlok 12: "O sagacious prince! If I deserve to be treated with kindness by you, if you think
of any virtue in me and if you think of any virtue in me and if you have any affection in me, stay
here for some more time."

Shlok 13: "O Rama! When you have been offered with reference all the entertainments, you along
with Lakshmana, your brother and Seetha your consort, shall then depart."

Shlok 14: "O Rama! In the meantime, accept you, with your entire army and assemblage of
friends, my hospitality which has been fixed and arranged by me, full of affection as I am."

Shlok 15: "O Rama! I entreat you with affection, respect and friendship I am your servant. I
am not in any way commanding you to do so."

Shlok 16: Hearing those words, Rama replied to Vibhishana as follows, while all the demons and
the monkeys present there, listened:

Shlok 17: "O destroyer of enemies! O hero! I stand honoured by you by your valued counsel,
your efforts put forth with your whole soul and more so by your friendship.

Shlok 18: "O king of demons! It is not that I am not carrying out your words. But, my heart is
hastening to see that Bharata, my brother."

Shlok 19-20: "My heart is hastening to see that Bharata, who came all the way to Mount Chitrakuta
to take me back to Ayodhya, yet whose appeal was not executed by me, even though he requested me
with his head bent low and Kausalya my mother as also Sumitra and the illustrious Kaikeyi (my
step-mothers) as also Guha my friend, as well as the citizens of Ayodhya and the inhabitants of the
country-side."

Shlok 21: "O gentle Vibhishana! Allow me to go. I am honoured. O friend! You need not be
disappointed, I entreat you."

Shlok 22: "O the king of demons! Fetch the aerial car immediately. How is it advisable for my
continued stay here, now that my task has been accomplished?"

Shlok 23-28: Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the king of demons then hastily invoked the
presence of that aerial car shining like the sun, with colourful parts made of gold, with the
platform made of cat's-eye gems, which was full of attics, shone like silver on all sides,
decorated well with white flags and flag-staff, decked with gold and golden lotuses, graced with
golden mansions, hung all over with networks of tiny bells, giving forth a melodious sound on all
sides, resembling a summit of Mount Meru, built by Vishvakarma, which was graced with stately
palaces decked with pearls and silver, provided with pavements inlaid with crystal, furnished with
excellent seats of cat's eye gems of great value and upholstered with highly valuable
coverings.

Shlok 29: Informing Rama that the said aerial car which could not be assailed and was as swift
as though- had arrived, Vibhishana stood there.

Shlok 30: The generous minded Rama along with Lakshmana felt amazed to see the aforesaid
aerial car, Pushpaka, which resembled a mountain and which could travel everywhere at will, arrived
on that occasion.



SARGA 122
------------------------------

[Text] Rama commands Vibhishana to honour the monkeys with gold and precious stones. When
Vibhishana has honoured them with the gifts, Rama along with Lakshmana and Seetha ascend the aerial
car. When the monkeys and Vibhishana request Rama to permit them to accompany in the aerial car
upto Ayodhya to witness his coronation-ceremony, Rama gladly permits them to do so. All of them
start on their aerial journey in Pushpaka, the wonderful aerial car which can accommodate all,
spaciously.

Shlok 1: Keeping ready Pushpaka the aerial car decorated with flowers, Vibhishana, for his
part, standing not very far, spoke to Rama (as follows):

Shlok 2: "What more can I do?" thus spoke with haste, Vibhishana endowed as he was with
modesty and with joined palms, to Rama.

Shlok 3: After some circumspection, Rama of great splendor, affectionately spoke the
following words to him, while Lakshmana was listening:

Shlok 4: "Let all these monkeys and bears (ie. Denizens of forests), who performed tasks of
exertion, be honoured with tasks of exertion, be honoured with precious stones and riches of
various kinds, O Vibhishana!"

Shlok 5: "O Vibhishana the king of demons! Lanka has conquered by you, in collaboration with
these monkeys, who never turned their backs in battles and fought joyfully, ignoring all risk to
their lives."

Shlok 6: "All these monkeys, without exceptions, have accomplished their task. Reward their
achievement with gifts of gold and precious stones."

Shlok 7: "Highly honoured in this way any duly cheered by you, acknowledging their services,
the chiefs of monkey-troops, will feel happy."

Shlok 8: "All will come nearer to you, for having possessed this quality of generosity, for
propitiating them, for showing compassion to them and for having subjugated your senses. Hence, I
am reminding you."

Shlok 9: "O king! Feeling agitated, the army deserts that king, who is bereft of all loving
qualities and who merely orders them to kill people in battle."

Shlok 10: Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana honoured all those monkeys, by dispersing
precious stones and gold to them.

Shlok 11: Thereafter, having seen on that occasion all those commanders of monkey-troops
honoured with precious stones and gold, Rama then mounted that excellent aerial car.

Shlok 12: He mounted the aerial car along with Lakshmana, his valiant brother wielding a bow
and taking the illustrious Seetha, who was feeling abashed, in his arms.

Shlok 13: Bestowing attention on all the monkeys as well as Vibhishana and the mighty
Sugreeva, Rama remaining in the aerial car, spoke (as follows):

Shlok 14: "O the foremost of monkeys! This work of a friend has been accomplished by you.
Permitted by me, all of you can go, where you will."

Shlok 15: "O Sugreeva! All that which ought to be done by an affectionate and service-minded
friend, has been done for your part by you, trembling alive as you are to righteousness.
Accompanied by your army, proceed to Kishkindha at once."

Shlok 16: "O Vibhishana! Settle down in your kingdom at Lanka, conferred by me. Even the
celestials including Indra shall not be able to attack you."

Shlok 17: " I am going to Ayodhya, the seat of government of my father. I bid adieu to you and
wish to take leave of you all."

Shlok 18: Hearing the words of Rama, the monkey-chiefs, the monkeys, Vibhishana the demon and
all of them there, with their joined palms, spoke (as follows):

Shlok 19: "We also wish to proceed to Ayodhya. You take all of us there we shall range the
gardens and groves there with rejoice."

Shlok 20: "O the excellent king! Seeing you, drench with ablution (in the coronation ceremony)
and offering our salutations to Kausalya, we shall return to our homes."

Shlok 21: Hearing those words of the monkeys and Vibhishana, that pious-minded Rama spoke to
those monkeys, Sugreeva and Vibhishana as follows:

Shlok 22: "Something more dearer than everything dear will be achieved by me, if I reach
Ayodhya with the host of my friends along with all of you, for, I shall feel delighted."

Shlok 23: "O Sugreeva! Mount the aerial cars quickly, along with the monkeys. O Vibhishana,
the king of demons! You also ascend it, along with your counsellors."

Shlok 24: Thereupon, that Sugreeva along with the monkeys gladly ascended that wonderful
Pushpaka, the aerial car. Vibhishana together with his counselors also ascended it.

Shlok 25: When all of them ascended, that excellent aerial car, belonging to Kubera, flew into
the sky, after having been duly authorized by Rama.

Shlok 26: Feeling greatly rejoiced and satisfied while travelling in that splendid aerial car,
which was now in the air and was provided with the image of a swan, Rama shone like Kubera.

Shlok 27: All those mighty monkeys, bears and demons sat comfortably and spaciously in that
wonderful aerial car.

[Text] In the course of their flight to Ayodhya, Rama shows to Seetha, the whole City of
Lanka, the battle-field where Ravana and other demons were killed, Nala-Setu the bridge which was
built across the ocean, Mount Mainka, Setu-bandha (where the construction of the bridge was
started), Mount Rishyamuka, Pampa River, Janasthana-forest, Panchavati, Godavari river, the

Shlok 1: As approved by Rama, that excellent aerial car, with images of swan painted on it,
flew into the sky, with a great sound.

Shlok 2: Casting his look on all sides, Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, then spoke to
Seetha, who had a moon-like face (as follows):

Shlok 3: "O Seetha! Look at the City of Lanka, resting firmly on the mount of Trikuta,
looking like a peak of Mount Kailasa and built by Viswarakarma, the universal architect."

Shlok 4: "O Seetha! Look at this great battle-field, covered with a mud of flesh and blood as
also a cause for the death of monkeys and demons."

Shlok 5: "O the large-eyed Seetha! Here lies Ravana, the king of demons, the tormentator of
people, on whom boons were conferred by Brahma and who was killed by me for your sake."

Shlok 6: "Here, Kumbhakarna and Prahasta the demon were killed. Here, Dhumraksha was killed
by Hanuma, the monkey."

Shlok 7: "Here was Vidyunmali killed by the great-souled Sushena and here was Indrajit, the
son of Ravana, killed by Lakshmana in a combat."

Shlok 8-9: "Here was killed a demon called Vikata by Angada. Virupaksha, who was disagreeable
to the sight, Mahaparsva, Mahodara, Akampana, Trishiras, Atikaya Devantaka, Narantaka and other
mighty demons were also killed here."

Shlok 10-11: "Both Yuddonmatta and Matta, the foremost of demons, as also Nikumbha and Kumbha the
sons of Kumbhakarna, as also the strong Vajradamshtra, Damshtra and many demons were killed.
Makaraksha, the most difficult demon to be attacked, was struck down by me in this
battle-field."

Shlok 12: "Akampana was killed in the great battle. The valiant Shonitaksha was also killed.
Yupaksa and Prajangha were killed."

Shlok 13: "Here, Vidyujjihva, the demon was a terrific appearance, was killed. Yajnashatru
also was killed. The mighty Suptaghna was killed. Surya shatru was killed and another demon called
Brahma shatru was too killed."

Shlok 14: "Here, surrounded by more than a thousand fellow-wives, Ravana's wife named
Mandodari lamented for Ravana."

Shlok 15: "O Seetha, the lovely-faced one! Here is seen a water-descent of the ocean on the
sea-shore, where having crossed the ocean, we spent that night."

Shlok 16: "O the large-eyed Seetha! Here is the bridge called Nala Setu, which was so
difficult to execute for others, got built by me over the salt-sea for your sake."

Shlok 17: "O Seetha! See this roaring imperturbable and seemingly boundless ocean, the
habitation of Varuna (the god of waters), which is teeming well with couches and
oyster-shells."

Shlok 18: "O Seetha! See the golden mountain, Mainaka (the ruler of mountains) which rose
passing through the ocean, in order to provide rest and relaxation to Hanuma."

Shlok 19: "See this island, located in the middle of the ocean, where my troops were
stationed. At this place, the lord Shiva (the supreme deity) formerly bestowed his grace on
me."

Shlok 20-21: "Here is seen the water-descent of the gigantic ocean, called a Setubandha, adored
in all the three worlds. This is very much a sacred spot, capable of washing away major sins. At
this very place, Vibhishana the king of demons first came."

Shlok 22: "O Seetha! Here is seen the beautiful City of Sugreeva, Kishkindha, which is full of
colourful groves, where Vali was killed by me."

Shlok 23: Seeing the City of Kishkindha, which was earlier ruled by Vali, Seetha, who was
feeling timid through love, then spoke the following courteous words to Rama.

Shlok 24-25: "O king! I wish to reach the capital City of Ayodhya along with you, accompanied by
the wives of other monkey-chiefs with Tara and other beloved wives of Sugreeva."

Shlok 26: Hearing the words of Seetha, Rama then said to her in reply "let it be". Reaching
Kishkindha, causing the aerial car to halt, and looking at Sugreeva, Rama spoke to him the
following words:

Shlok 27: "O the king of monkeys! Instruct all the monkey-chiefs to come to Ayodhya in the
company of their wives."

Shlok 28: "O the mighty Sugreeva, the King of monkeys! You too hasten to depart, taking the
wives of all the monkeys "we shall proceed."

Shlok 29-30: Hearing the words of Rama of great splendour, that illustrious Sugreeva, the lord of
monkeys accompanied by all those monkeys, quickly entering his gynaecium, spoke to Tara as
follows:

Shlok 31: "O the beloved lady! You have been permitted by Rama to proceed to Ayodhya, in the
company of the wives of the great-souled monkeys, with an intent to gratify Seetha."

Shlok 32: "You hurry up, to proceed to Ayodhya, with the wives of the monkeys. We shall show
Ayodhya and all the widows of Dasaratha to them."

Shlok 33: Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Tara, who was charming of every limb, called all the
spouses of the monkeys and spoke to them as follows:

Shlok 34: "Duly permitted by Sugreeva and all the monkeys, hurry up to proceed to Ayodhya. A
kindly act will be done to me too, through the sight of Ayodhya (which is so dear to me)."

Shlok 35: "We shall also see the entry of Rama into Ayodhya, along with the people of that
city as well as the inhabitants of the country-side, as also the affluence of the widows of
Dasaratha."

Shlok 36: Duly permitted by Tara, all the wives of the monkeys, wearing their costumes as per
rule and going round the aerial car clockwise, ascended it with an intent to see Seetha.

Shlok 37: Seeing the aerial car having risen quickly, after having taken the wives of monkeys
too, Rama again spoke to Seetha at the vicinity of Mount Rishyamuka (as follows):

Shlok 38: "O Seetha! Here is seen Rishyamuka, the excellent mountain, endowed with layers of
gold and looking like a cloud with lightning."

Shlok 39: "O Seetha! Here did I meet Sugreeva, the king of monkeys and an agreement too was
made by me for the killing of Vali."

Shlok 40: "Here is seen Pampa-river, abounding in lotuses and edged with colourful groves,
where I lamented with great pain, having been separated from you."

Shlok 41: "The virtuous Shabari was seen by me at the bank of this river. Here was killed,
Kabandha, having arms, a Yojana (eight miles) long."

Shlok 42-43: "And over there is seen in the forest of Janasthana, O Seetha, that illustrious tree
under which the highly brilliant and mighty Jatayu, the foremost among the birds, was killed by
Ravana, for your sake, O sporting lady!."

Shlok 44-45: "O lady of beautiful complexion! Here is the region, (known as Panchavati, so called
because it consists of five banyan trees) where Khara the demon was killed by me with
straight-going arrows, as also his brothers, Dushana and the mighty Trishiras. And over there is
seen our enchanting leaf-hut, where you were forcibly taken away by Ravana the king of demons, O
charming lady!"

Shlok 46: "Here is the shining hermitage of Sutikshna, the great-souled sage. And over there
is seen the great hermitage of Sharabhanga, where the thousand-eyed Indra, the destroyer of
Citadels, came."

Shlok 47-48: "Here is the shining hermitage of Sutikshna, the great-souled sage. And over there
is seen the great hermitage of Sharabhanga, where the thousand-eed Indra, the destroyer of
Citadels, came."

Shlok 49: "O slender-waisted lady! Here are seen those sages, where, Atri the head of the
hermitage, was equal in splendour to the sun and the fire."

Shlok 50: "At this place, the gigantic Viradha was killed by me. O Seetha! Here was seen by
you, the virtuous Anasuya, the ascetic lady (the wife of sage, Atri)."

Shlok 51: "O Seetha, having a beautiful body! Here is Chitrakuta, the excellent mountain,
shining. Bharata came here to seek my favour (in the form of my consent to return to Ayodhya)."

Shlok 52: "O Seetha! Here is seen the beautiful river of Yamuna, surrounded by colourful
groves. Here is seen the illustrious hermitage of Sage Bharadwaja."

Shlok 53: "Here is seen the holy River Ganga, which wends its way through the three worlds
(viz. heaven, the earth and the subterranean world), whose banks are crowded with flocks of birds
and which is lined with trees in full-flowering."

Shlok 54: "Here is the town of Shringaberapura, where Guha my friend stays. Here is seen that
river, Sarayu, lined with rows of sacrificial posts (the relics of sacrifices performed from time
to time by Ikshvaku dynasty), bordered with hundreds of trees and with groves in full blossom."

Shlok 55: "O Seetha! Here is seen that Capital City of my father. O the princess of Videha
territory! Having duly returned, offer your salutation to Ayodhya."

Shlok 56: Thereupon, all those monkeys and the rejoiced demons along with Vibhishana, at that
time, bounding again and again (to have a glimpse of it) saw that City.

Shlok 57: Thereupon, the monkeys along with the demons beheld that Ayodhya, having rows of
white palaces, intersected with wide roads, and crowded with elephants and horses, looking like
Amaravathi, the City of Indra the lord of Celestials.



SARGA 124
------------------------------

[Text] Rama, travelling in the aerial car towards Ayodhya, lands at the hermitage of
Bharadwaja the sage. When Rama enquires of Bhardwaja about the welfare of Ayodhya-City, Bharata and
his mothers. Bharadwaja informs Rama about their welfare. Further, the sage informs that by virtue
of his asceticism, he could know everything about the exploits of Rama from the day he left
Ayodhya, till he destroyed Ravana. Then, Rama seeks a boon from Bharadwaja, asking him to make the
trees on the route to Ayodhya, to bear fruit in the off-season for which the sage grants the boon.
Thereupon, the troops of monkeys feasted on those fruits at will.

Shlok 1: After completion of fourteen years of his exile and on the fifth day of the bright
half of the lunar month of Ashvayuja (roughly corresponding to the month of September), Rama, who
was disciplined even now, reaching the hermitage of the sage Bharadwaja, offered his salutation to
the sage.

Shlok 2: Having offered his obeisance to Bharadwaja, who was rich in asceticism, Rama
enquired (of him): "Have you heard, O venerable one, of Ayodhya City having an abundance of food
and free from disease? Is that Bharata attentive in his rule? I hope my mothers are still
alive."

Shlok 3: Hearing the words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage, quite rejoiced as he was,
smilingly replied to Rama (as follows):

Shlok 4: "Bharata, with his mud-smeared limbs 9throwing the burden and blame ie. mud and with
matted locks, as also placing your wooden-sandals before him, is looking forward for your arrival.
All are safe at your home and in the city."

Shlok 5-7: "O Rama, the victorious in battles! Formerly, on seeing you penetrating deeply into
the great forest on foot, with the sole intention of practicing virtue, clad in pieces of bark,
going away from sovereignty, deprived of all enjoyments, like an immortal fallen from heaven,
having renounced all your possession, with your spouse (Seetha) as the third (of your party besides
Lakshmana and yourself), resolved in carrying out the behest of your father and intent on
implementing the pledge given (by your father) to Kaikeyi and living on wild roots and fruits, pity
arose in me earlier."

Shlok 8: "But now, a great delight occurred to me, on seeing you, having fulfilled your
purpose, that you have conquered your enemies and are accompanied by your host of friends and
relatives."

Shlok 9: "That joy and sorrow experienced by you in abundance while residing in
Janasthana-forest in completely known to me, O Rama!"

Shlok 10: "While you were busy in protecting all the ascetics who prayed you for safeguarding
the interests of Brahmanas, this irreproachable wife of yours was taken away by Ravana."

Shlok 11-16: "O Rama, devoted to virtue! Even the appearance of Mareecha, the abduction of Seetha
by Ravana, the sight of Kabandha, your arrival at the Pampa lake, your alliance with Sugreeva, how
Vali was killed by you, the search-operation for Seetha, the exploit of Hanuma, the tracing of
Seetha, how the bridge, Nalasetu was constructed (over the sea), how the City of Lanka was set fire
by the rejoiced monkey-chiefs, how that Ravana who was the thorn in the side of gods and how was
arrogant of his might, was killed in battle, with his sons kinsfolk and his ministers as the gods
happened, how a boon was conferred by them on you- all this is known to me by virtue of my
asceticism. My disciples, who were accustomed to report to me the news, used to go to Ayodhya-City
from here."

Shlok 17: "The friends, the riches and the grains are highly honoured in this world. Mother
and mother-land are far superior to even the heaven."

Shlok 18: Bowing to the aforesaid statement of the sage with his head bent low, highly pleased
as he was and saying, "By all means" the glorious prince (Rama) asked of him the following
boon:

Shlok 19: "O venerable sir! Let all the trees on the way, even as I fly to Ayodhya, bear fruit
even in the off-season and flow with honey. Let abundant fruits of various kinds, emitting the
fragrance of nectar, appear on them."

Shlok 20: Once the consent of the sage was given in the words "be it so", the trees there grew
to be closely like the heavenly trees.

Shlok 21-22: Then, for an extent of three Yojanas (twenty four miles) on all sides, in the
direction of their travel, the trees that no longer bore fruit, were laden with fruit and those
which had ceased to blossom looked charming with blossom. The withered trees were fully clothed
with foliage and further began to flow with honey.

Shlok 23: Highly rejoiced who had conquered the heaven, those monkey-chiefs thereupon consumed
at will, thousands of many of those wonderful fruits.



SARGA 125
------------------------------

[Text] Rama asks Hanuma to proceed to Shringaberapura and communicate to Guha about his
welfare and also to know the appropriate path to Ayodhya. Rama also asks Hanuma to go to Ayodhya
and communicate to Bharata about his welfare and also the previous happenings at the forest and at
Lanka, including the abduction of Seetha and her restoration, by killing Ravana in battle. Rama
also asks Hanuma to inform Bharata, about their arrival at the proximity of Ayodhya, along with
Sugreeva and Vibhishana. Accordingly, Hanuma approaches Guha and Bharata in Nandigrama and informs
the pleasant news about the welfare of Rama as well as his impending return to Ayodhya. Bharata is
overjoyed on hearing the glad tidings from Hanuma and offers him a number of valuable gifts, for
having communicated the agreeable news to him.

Shlok 1: Looking at Ayodhya, Rama, a scion of Raghu dynasty, for his part, who wished to do a
kindly act and who was quick in exhibiting prowess, contemplated thereupon to do a kindly act.

Shlok 2: Having thus contemplated, the sagacious and the glorious Rama then cast his glimpse
on the monkeys and spoke to Hanuma, the monkey (as follows):

Shlok 3: "O the foremost of the monkeys! Going with all speed to Ayodhya, find out whether
the people there, are safe in the royal palace.

Shlok 4: "Reaching then to Shrigaberapura, communicate in my name, about my welfare to Guha,
the king of Nishadas, a wild tribe living in the forest."

Shlok 5: "Guha will be pleased to hear about me, as being safe, healthy and free from
trouble. He is my friend, as well as my own self."

Shlok 6: Feeling pleased, Guha, the lord of Nishadas, the wild tribe, will tell the path to
Ayodhya and the news about Bharata."

Shlok 7: "Bharata too is to be asked by you, the news about his welfare, in my name. Tell him
of me as having returned, accomplished of our object, with my consort and Lakshmana."

Shlok 8: "Tell him about the abduction of Seetha by the mighty Ravana, my conversation with
Sugreeva and the killing of Vali in combat."

Shlok 9: "Tell him also about the search for Seetha and how she was traced out by you, after
crossing the never-diminishing ocean, having extensive waters."

Shlok 10: "Tell him about our going near the ocean, the appearance of the ocean, how the
bridge was constructed there and how Ravana was killed."

Shlok 11: "Tell him about the bestower of boons by Indra the lord of celestials, by brahma the
lord of creation, and by Varuna the lord of waters, my meeting with my (deceased) father, through
the grace of Shiva the Supreme Deity."

Shlok 12: "O gentle Hanuma! Inform to Bharata, of me as having come near Ayodhya, along with
Vibhishana and Sugreeva the lord of monkeys."

Shlok 13: "Tell him, that having conquered hosts of enemies and obtained an excellent fame, is
purpose having been accomplished, Rama is coming near, with is mighty friends."

Shlok 14: "It is also to be observed by you, about the facial expression which Bharata wears,
after hearing all this and also all that he intends to do in relation to me."

Shlok 15: "All the occurrences there are to be known. All the gestures of Bharata are to be
ascertained through the colour of his face, glances and the speech."

Shlok 16: "Whose mind does not turn round, with a kingdom abundantly rich in all coveted
enjoyments, teeming with elephants horses and chariots and which is in herited from one's
father?"

Shlok 17: "Having been associated with the kingdom for long, if the illustrious Bharata is
longing for it himself, let Bharata rule the entire kingdom in one piece."

Shlok 18: "O Hanuma! Understanding his mind and perception, you ought to return quickly,
before we are not gone for a long distance towards Ayodhya."

Shlok 19: Assuming a human form, when thus commanded by Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god,
swiftly left for Ayodhya.

Shlok 20: Hanuma, the son of wind-god then flew up with speed towards Ayodhya, as Garuda the
eagle would fly with speed, while seeking to catch a large snake.

Shlok 21-22: Leaping into the auspicious sky, the dwelling place of birds, duly crossing over the
terrific conjunction of Ganga and Yamuna rivers, reaching Shringaverapura and approaching Guha (the
chief of Nishadas), that valiant Hanuma spoke the following words in a charming voice:

Shlok 23: "Along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama, your friend, that scion of Kakutthsa, of
true prowess, has for his part enquired of your welfare."

Shlok 24: "You can see Rama here itself today, when he has been duly permitted by Bharadwaja
the sage, after spending, at the instance of the sage, for a night of the fifth lunar day (of the
bright half of the month of Ashvayuja)."

Shlok 25: That swift-moving Hanuma, with his rejoicingly feather-like body and with a great
splendor, not thinking of his fatigue, sprang up with a great speed.

Shlok 26: Hanuma saw, on the way, Ramatirtha, a place of descent into the river (hallowed by
the association of Lord Parashurama), as well as the rivers Valukini, Varuthini and Gomati as also
the formidable forest of Sala trees, many thousands of people and numerous communities.

Shlok 27-28: Going quickly for a long distance, that foremost of the monkeys reached trees in
flowering, near Nandigrama and looking like those comprised in the garden of Kubera (known by the
name, Chitraratha) and frequented by women along with their sons and elders, charmingly adorned as
they were.

Shlok 29-33: At a distance of two miles from Ayodhya Hanuama saw Bharata, living in a hermitage,
with the bark trees and the skin of a black antelope wrapped round his waist, looking miserable and
emaciated, wearing matted locks on his head, his limbs coated with dirt, afflicted through
separation from Rama his elder brother, subsisting on roots and fruits, with his senses subdued,
engaged in austerities, protecting virtue, with a very high head of matted hair, covering his body
with the bark of trees and a deer skin, disciplined, whose thoughts were fixed on the Supreme
Spirit, with a splendour equalling that of a Brahmanical sage, ruling the earth after placing the
wooden sandals before him, protecting the people belonging to all the four grades (viz. Brahmans
Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Shudras) from all peril and attended by the upright ministers, priests and
by clever troop-commanders, all clad in saffron robes.

Shlok 34: Those citizens, who were all fond of righteousness, were not willing to enjoy
pleasures, ignoring that prince clad in the bark of trees and the skin of a black antelope.

Shlok 35: With joined palms in salutation, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke as follows to that
Bharata, who knew what is right and seemed to be a second Dharma (the god of virtue) clothed with a
body of virtue:

Shlok 36: "Rama, for whom you are repenting residing as he was in the forest of Dandaka
wearing the bark of trees and matted locks, has enquired about your welfare."

Shlok 37: "O Lord! I am telling you a pleasant news. Give up this dreadful anguish. Within a
while, you will be meeting Rama, your elder brother."

Shlok 38: "Having killed Ravana and got back Seetha, Rama is returning with his mighty
friends, his purpose duly accomplished."

Shlok 39: "Lakshmana too, who is endowed with extraordinary energy, is coming intact with
Seetha, the illustrious princess of Videha territory and with Rama as Sachi (the wife of Indra)
would with the mighty Indra the lord of celestials."

Shlok 40: Hearing the words of Hanuma, Bharata the son of Kaikeyi, felt delighted and sank all
at once to the ground as also fainted through joy.

Shlok 41: Thereupon, Bharata who was born in Raghu dynasty, got up from the swoon within a
while and regaining his consciousness, spoke the following words to Hanuma, who spoke pleasant
tidings to him.

Shlok 42: Embracing Hanuma with eagerness, the illustrious Bharata bathed him with copious
tear-drops born of delight and as such, other than those born of anguish.

Shlok 43-45: "O the gentle one! Are you a divine being or a human being, who have come here out
of compassion? To you, who have given this agreeable news to me, I shall give in return, for the
pleasant tidings, a hundred thousand cows, a hundred best villages, and for wives, sixteen golden
complexioned virgin girls of a good conduct, decked with ear-rings, having beautiful noses and
thighs, adorned with all kinds of jewels, with charming countenances as delightful as the moon and
born in a noble family."

Shlok 46: Hearing the news of Rama's arrival resembling a womnder, from Hanuma, Bharata the
prince felt overjoyed by a desire to see Rama and spoke the following words again with delight:



SARGA 126
------------------------------

[Text] Hanuma recounts to Bharata, broad details relating to the soujourn of Rama, Seetha
and Lakshmana in the forest from the day Bharata takes wooden sandals of Rama, till the day Ravana
is killed.

Shlok 1: "I am indeed hearing a delight mention of my lord, who proceeded to the vast forest
so many years ago.

Shlok 2: "This common saying sounds to me good, that bliss comes to a surviving man, even if
it be after a hundred years!"

Shlok 3: "How and on what ground, an alliance has been concluded between Rama and the monkeys
and at what place? Tell the truth to me, enquiring as I am."

Shlok 4: Seated comfortably on a cushion and interrogated by Bharata, Hanuma thereupon began
to narrate the entire exploits of Rama in the forest.

Shlok 5-9: "O Lord, the long-armed! How your mother was conferred with two boons by your
father, how Rama was sent to exile, how Dasaratha the king died, with a shocking sorrow for his
son's exile, how you were brought quickly from Rajagriha (the seat of government of Kekaya kings)
by the envoys, how sovereignty was not coveted by you when you returned to Ayodhya, how on your
going to mount Chitrakuta, your, elder brother the tormentator of enemies was invited by you who
followed righteousness to take back the kingdom, how Rama who stood by his father's words,
renounced the kingdom and stood by his father's words, renounced the kingdom and how your returned
to Ayodhya, taking with you the wooden sandals all this is known accurately to you. Hear from me
now, that which occurred after you had returned to Ayodhya."

Shlok 10: "When you had gone away, that forest (of Chitrakuta) then assumed a very miserable
appearance, with the frightened animals and birds (on seeing strange people there)."

Shlok 11: "Rama, thereupon, entered that large, terrific and solitary forest of Dandaka, which
had been trampled by elephants and extensive with lions, tigers and deers."

Shlok 12: "In front of them, even as they were going in that dense forest, there appeared
Viradha, a demon, uttering forth a very loud roar.

Shlok 13: "They cast him, who rushed with uplifted arms towards them, into a pit, turning his
head bent low, and who was emitting a loud cry, like an elephant."

Shlok 14: "Carrying out that ardous task, Rama and Lakshmana, both the brothers, went to the
beautiful hermitage of Sharbhanga, in that evening.

Shlok 15: "Offering salutation to all the hermits when Sharabhanga ascended to heaven, Rama
who truly mighty, reached the region of Janasthana."

Shlok 16: "Thereafter, a female-demon called Surpanakha sought the presence of Rama. As
ordered by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana thereupon rose quickly and seizing a sword, chopped off her
ears and nose."

Shlok 17: "Fourteen thousand demons, inhabiting Janasthana-region, were killed by the
great-souled Rama, while sojourning that region."

Shlok 18: "The demons, who came together at the battle-front, were wholly finished by Rama
alone, in a fraction of a quarter of a day."

Shlok 19: "The demons who were the mighty inhabitants of Dandaka-forest, who were causing
obstacles to the austerity of the ascetics, were killed by Rama."

Shlok 20: "The demons were smashed in the battle. Khara (their leader) also was killed. After
killing Dushana (his brother) first, Trishira (the other brother) was killed thereafter."

Shlok 21-22: "Tormented by the incident of destruction of demons, the foolish Surpanakha sought
refuge with Ravana. Disguised in the form of a deer studded with precious stones, a terrific demon
by name, Maricha, a follower of Ravana, allured Seetha."

Shlok 23: "That Seetha, on seeing it, told Rama, 'Let this deer be caught. Our hermitage will
turn out to be charming and pleasing to the eye'."

Shlok 24: "Thereupon, Rama wielding a bow in his arm, chased that deer and killed that running
one, with an arrow of curved knots."

Shlok 25: "O good sir! While Rama was chasing the deer and even when Lakshmana had gone out,
Ravana forthwith entered their hermitage during that interval."

Shlok 26: "Ravana, the demon, seized Seetha, even as a planet like Mars would obscure the
constellation, Rohini. Having killed a vulture named Jatayu, who sought to deliver her, Ravana then
went quickly in haste, taking Seetha with him"

Shlok 27-28: "Then, in surprise, some monkeys who was staying on a mountain-peak, looking like
mountain, saw, with astonishment writ large in their faces, Ravana the king of demons, passing that
way, taking away Seetha."

Shlok 29: "Going still faster and ascending along with Seetha, the aerial car, Pushpaka, which
was as swift as thought, the mighty Ravana the king of demons thereupon entered the City of
Lanka."

Shlok 30: "Conducting that Seetha into a large beautiful mansion, embellished with gold, that
Ravana sought to cajole her gently with his words."

Shlok 31: "Caring a straw for that Ravana and his talk, Seetha, later, actually remained in
Ashoka-grove."

Shlok 32-33: "Having killed that deer, Rama while returning to the hermitage, saw the vulture
(Jatayu) in the forest. Rama was greatly disturbed. Seeing the vulture (Jatayu) who was dearer to
him than his own father killed, Rama was disturbed."

Shlok 34: "While searching for Seetha, RAma along with Lakshmana strolled after blossomed
woodlands along the bank of Godavari-river."

Shlok 35: "They met, in that great forest, a demon by name Kabandha. Then according to the
advice of Kabandha, Rama of true prowess met Sugreeva, after heading for Mount Rishyamuka."

Shlok 36-37: "Even before they met, a meeting of hearts through affinity, had taken place between
them. Sugreeva had been banished in the past by the enraged Vali, his elder brother and as a result
of mutual talks, affection deeply arose between Rama and Sugreeva."

Shlok 38: "Having killed with the strength of his arms in combat, the mighty Vali with a
colossal body, Rama caused the kingdom of Sugreeva restored.

Shlok 39: "Sugreeva, who was established in his kingdom with all, his monkeys, had given his
pledge to Rama, to commence a search for Seetha the princess."

Shlok 40: "Ten crores of monkeys were accordingly commanded by the great-souled Sugreeva and
sent to all the four quarters."

Shlok 41: "Having lost our way in Vindhya, the foremost of mountain-ranges, a long time
slipped past us and we felt sore-stricken with sorrow."

Shlok 42: "Meanwhile, the brother of Jatayu (the king of vultures), Sampati by name, precisely
communicated to us that Seetha was dwelling in the habitation of Ravana."

Shlok 43: "Removing the grief of my kinsfolk, who were seized with sorrow, I, as such, crossed
one hundred yojanas (eight hundred miles of the ocean), resorting to my own strength."

Shlok 44: "There, I saw Seetha, living alone in a grove of Ashoka trees, clad in a soiled
silk-saree, looking cheerless, but unflinching in her vow."

Shlok 45: "After meeting her and duly enquiring that faultless Seetha, everything of her, a
ring with the name, Rama engraved on it, was handed-over to her by me as a token."

Shlok 46: "Receiving in return from her, a jewel (from her head), I came back to the northern
shore, successful as I was in my undertaking. On my return, that brilliant and valuable jewel was
given by me as a token to Rama who was unweary in action."

Shlok 47: "On hearing the news of Seetha, Rama for his part regained the hope to survive, as a
dying patient would, on drinking the ambrosia."

Shlok 48: "Excited as he was to put forth a war-effort, he set his mind on the destruction of
Lanka, as the fire-god intending to destroy all the three worlds, would, at the end of the
universe."

Shlok 49: "Then, on reaching the ocean, he got a bridge constructed by Nala and through that
bridge, the army of the valiant monkeys crossed the ocean."

Shlok 50: "Neela killed Prahasta. Rama, the scion of Raghu dynasty, personally killed
Kumbhakarna and Ravana. Lakshmana killed Indrajit, the son of Ravana."

Shlok 51-52: "The illustrious Rama, the destroyer of enemies, happened to meet Indra the lord of
celestials, Yama the lord of dissolution, Varuna the lord of waters, Maheshvara, the great lord
(Shiva), Brahma the lord of creation as also Dasaratha (his deceased father) and was bestowed boons
by them. Sages and celestial masters who came there, too gave boons."

Shlok 53: "Having been granted boons, Rama for his part flew to Kishkindha in an aerial car
called Pushpaka, along with the monkeys who gathered there."

Shlok 54: "Reaching the coast-line of Ganga-river again, Rama is staying in the presence of
the sage, Bharadwaja. Tomorrow, when the moon will be in conjunction with the asteroid, Pushya you
will be able to see Rama, without any obstacle."

Shlok 55: "Gladdened to hear Rama's impending return to Ayodhya in the sweet words of Hanuma,
Bharata offered his salutation by joining his palms together and spoke the following words, which
enraptured his mind: 'My desire has been fulfilled indeed after a long time'."



SARGA 127
------------------------------

[Text] Bharata, after hearing the good news from Hanuma about the arrival of Rama, calls
Shatrughna and commands him to make appropriate arrangements for the reception of Rama in the City
of Ayodhya. Bharata departs with all others, for Nandigrama to receive Rama. The aerial car lands
at Nandigrama. Bharata welcomes Rama and others, by embracing them and by greeting them joyously.
Rama too offers his salutations to all his mothers, who come to receive him. Then, Bharata brings
Rama's wooden sandals and places them below the feet of Rama. Rama commands Pushpaka, the aerial
car to return to Kubera, the lord of riches to whom it originally belonged.

Shlok 1: "Hearing the news of a great happiness from Hanuma, Bharata the truly brave ruler
and the destroyer of enemies, commanded (as follows) to Shatrughna, who too felt delighted at the
news."

Shlok 2: "Let men of good conduct, offer worship to their family-deities, sanctuaries in the
city with sweet-smelling flowers and to the accompaniment of musical instruments."

Shlok 3-4: "Let bards well-versed in singing praises and Puranas (containing ancient legends,
cosmogony etc.) as also all panegyrists, all those proficient in the use of musical instruments,
courtesans all collected together, the queen-mothers, ministers, army-men and their wives,
brahmanas accompanied by Kshatriyas (members of fighting class), leaders of guilds of traders and
artisans, as also their members, come out to see the moon-like countenance of Rama."

Shlok 5: Hearing the words of Bharata, Shatrughna the destroyer of valiant adversaries called
together, laborers working on wages, numbering many thousands and dividing them into gangs, ordered
them (as follows):

Shlok 6: "Let the cavities on the path from Nandigrama to Ayodhya be levelled. Let the rough
and the even places be made flat."

Shlok 7: "Let the entire ground be sprinkled with ice-gold water. Let some others strew it
all over with parched grains and flowers."

Shlok 8: "Let the streets in Ayodhya, the excellent City, be lined with flags. Let the
dwellings (on the road-side) be decorated, till the time of rising of the sun."

Shlok 9: "Let hundreds of men sprinkle, on the main royal highway, with five fragrant colours
and with rows of garlands as well as lose flowers."

Shlok 10-11: On hearing that command of Shatrughna, Dhrushti, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha,
Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, Mantrapala and Sumantra proceeded with joy.

Shlok 12: Some rode on thousands of well-adorned elephants in rut and bearing banners. Some
others rode on female-elephants provided with golden girths, along with those elephants. Excellent
chariot-warriors issued forth in their chariots, with speed.

Shlok 13-14: Warriors on selected horses even still superior ones in thousands, bearing banners
and pennants, carrying javelins, spears and nooses, as also surrounded by thousands of
foot-soldiers, sallied forth.

Shlok 15: Then, all the wives of the deceased Dasaratha, placing Kausalya and Sumitra in front
of them, mounting their vehicles, issued forth. All of them, including Kaikeyi, reached
Nandigrama.

Shlok 16-20: Placing the wooden sandals of his brother (Rama) on his head and taking the white
parasol (intended for Rama) which was adorned with white garlands and two white whisks decorated
with gold, eminently worthy of kings, accompanied by the foremost of Brahmanas, leaders of the
guilds of traders and artisans, including the mercantile class, surrounded by the counselors with
garlands and bell-shaped sweets in their hands, cheered by the blass of conches and kettle-drums,
duly praised by panegyrists, the great-souled Bharata, for his part, whose mind was set on
righteousness, who was well-versed with the secret of virtue, who was emaciated through fasting,
who felt miserable, was clad in the bark of trees and the sking of a black antelope, who
experienced joy for the first time in hearing the news of the arrival of his brother then went in
advance, along with his ministers, to meet Rama."

Shlok 21: The earth seemed, as it were, shaking with the sound of horse-hoofs the rattling of
rims of chariot-wheels and by the tumults of couches and kettle-drums.

Shlok 22: The entire City of Ayodhya literally reached Nandigrama. Glancing round, Bharata
spoke as follows to Hanuma.

Shlok 23: "Indeed, I hope the fickle-mindedness which constitutes the peculiarity of monkeys,
has not been resorted to by you. For I do not indeed see Rama, a worthy scion of Kakutthsa and the
destroyer of adversaries."

Shlok 24: When these remarks were uttered by Bharata, Hanuma forthwith replied, as follows to
Bharata of unfailing prowess, by his meaningful words which were, as if they were apprising the
situation.

Shlok 25-27: "A formidable roar of rejoiced monkeys is being heard, for, they are seeing on the
way, trees which continually, yield fruit, adorned with blossom, flowing with honey which is drunk
by bees, making reverberant humming sounds - all due to the grace of Sage Bharadwaja O Bharata, the
destroyer of adversaries! A boon was conferred by Indra, the lord of celestials, by virtue of which
a hospitality rich with all excellences was earlier extended by Bharadwaja to you, with your entire
army. I presume that the aforesaid army of monkeys is crossing the rivers, Gomati."

Shlok 28: "See the cloud of dust, shooting froths towards the grove of Sala trees. I presume
that the monkeys are shaking the beautiful grove of Sala trees."

Shlok 29: "There is seen, in distance, that very famous aerial car, shining brightly like the
moon. The wonderful aerial car called Pushpaka was built with his intelligence by Viswakarma (an
architect of gods, who has been referred to here as Brahma by virtue of his creative talent.)."

Shlok 30: "This wonderful aerial car, with a speed of thought, which is carrying the great
souled Rama, and shines brightly like the rising sun, belongs to Kubera, the lord of riches, by the
grace of brahma, the lord of creation. (Who bestowed it on him)"

Shlok 31: "In the same aerial car are the valiant Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers, along with
Seetha, the immensely brilliant Sugreeva and Vibhishana the demon."

Shlok 32: Meanwhile, the words 'Here comes Rama' were loudly said and a clamour born of joy
from the mouth of women, children, youth and elders touched the sky.

Shlok 33: Descending from their chariots, elephants as also horses and standing on the ground,
all those people saw, like the moon in the sky, that Rama seated in the aerial car.

Shlok 34: The over-joyed Bharata with his joined palms, his face turned towards Rama,
worshipped and welcomed him in a befitting way.

Shlok 35: Rama, with his long and large eyes, seated in the aerial car, created by Viswakarma
the divine architect with his intelligence, shone like another Indra who carries the thunderbolt in
his hand.

Shlok 36: Bent low in reverence, Bharata then saluted Rama, who stood in the forepart of the
aerial car and shining like the sun appearing on Mount Meru.

Shlok 37: As authorized by Rama, that excellent aerial car, having a great speed and endowed
with the images of swans, landed on the ground.

Shlok 38: Feeling glad, when lifted on that aerial car and approaching Rama, Bharata of true
valour, greeted him yet again.

Shlok 39: Fully rising from his seat and placing that Bharata, who was seen after a long time,
on his lap, Rama delightfully embraced him.

Shlok 40: Thereafter, the jubilant Bharata, the destroyer of adversaries, approaching
Lakshmana and Seetha, then saluted them in reverence and also announced his name.

Shlok 41: Then, Bharata embraced Sugreeva, Jambavan, Angada, Mainda, Dvivida, Neela and
Rishabha.

Shlok 42: He also embraced Sushena, Nala, Gavaksha, Gandhamadana, Sharabha, Panasa and the
surrounding monkeys.

Shlok 43: Then, those monkeys, who can change their form at will, assumed the form of humans
and rejoicingly asked about the welfare of Bharata.

Shlok 44: Thereupon, the immensely brilliant Bharata, the son of Dasaratha and the foremost
among the virtuous, after embracing Sugreeva the excellent monkey, spoke to him (as follows):

Shlok 45: "You are a fifth brother, for all the four of us, O Sugreeva! A friend is born of
affection, while malifience is the attribute of an adversary."

Shlok 46: Thereafter, Bharata spoke the following kind words to Vibhishan: "Thank heaven! A
very difficult task was accomplished by you, as a companion of Rama."

Shlok 47: Then, the valiant Shatrughna offered his salutation to Rama, along with Lakshmana
and offered his reverential salutation to Seetha's feet, by bowing in humility.

Shlok 48: By going to his mother, who became pale and emaciated due to her grief, Rama, by
bowing, seized her feet in salutation, making his mother's heart delighted.

Shlok 49: Offering salutation to Sumatra, the illustrious Kaikeyi and all his mothers, Rama
then went to Vasishta the priest and offered his salutation in reverence.

Shlok 50: With joined palms, all the citizens of Ayodhya said to Rama: "Welcome to you, O the
great-armed! O the enhancer of Kausala's delight!"

Shlok 51: Rama saw those thousands of joined palms held by the citizens, appearing as
lotus-flowers in bloom.

Shlok 52: Taking those wooden sandals of Rama, Bharata, the knower of virtue, personally
placed them below the feet of Rama, the lord of men.

Shlok 53: Having offered his salutation with joined palms, Bharata spoke to Rama as follows:
"This entire sovereignty of yours, kept with me as a deposit, is being returned to you, by me."

Shlok 54: "My life has accomplished its purpose today and my wish too stands fulfilled, in
that I see you, its king, come back to Ayodhya."

Shlok 55: "You review your treasury, granary, palace of your spirit, everything has been
enhanced tenfold by me."

Shlok 56: Seeing that Bharata, speaking thus with affection with his brother, Vibhishana the
demon and the monkeys shed their tears.

Shlok 57: Placing Bharata on his lap with delight, Rama thereupon flew with his army (of
monkeys and bears) in that aerial car to the hermitage of Bharata.

Shlok 58: Reaching the hermitage of Bharata along with his army Rama then descended from the
anterior of the aerial car and stood, for the time-being, on the ground.

Shlok 59: Then, Rama, for his part, spoke to that excellent aerial car, "Serve as a transport
to Kubera, the lord. I permit you to leave."

SARGA 128
------------------------------

[Text] At the request of Bharata to take back the kingdom of Ayodhya, Rama accepts the
offer and sits on a seat. Bharata and Rama take their bath and get adorned for the occasion. Rama,
mounting on an excellent chariot, sallies forth on a procession in the city accompanied by Bharata,
Shatrughna, Lakshmana and Vibhishana. Nine thousand elephants follow the procession, with Sugreeva
and other monkeys mounted on them. Some attendants and musicians with their musical instruments
walk in front of Rama's procession. The citizens of Ayodhya host flags on every house. Rama returns
to his paternal palace in Ayodhya. Sugreeva orders four of his monkeys to bring water from four
oceans in jars given to them. Some monkeys brought water from five hundred rivers, as also from the
four oceans for the purpose of the ceremony. Vasishta along with other brahmins as priests caused
Rama to be consecrated with that water. The virgins, ministers, warriors, merchants, the four gods
as well as other gods sprinkled sap of all kinds of herbs on Rama. Vasishta and other priests
officiating the coronation-ceremony adorned Rama with an auspicious and charming crown. Then, Rama
gives away presents to the priests as well as Sugreeva and Angada. Rama presents a pearl-necklace
to Seetha and Seetha presents that necklace in turn to Hanuma. Rama further gives away presents to
Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Jambavan and others on the occasion. Rama bids farewell to monkeys. The glory
of the epic is complemented in the end by Valmiki.

Shlok 1: Placing his hallowed hands together on his head (as a mark of salutation), Bharata
the enhancer of Kaikeyi's happiness, spoke to the truly brave Rama, his elder brother (as
follows):

Shlok 2: "You gave this kingdom to me and treated my mother's words respectfully. As you gave
it to me then, in the same way I am giving it to you again.

Shlok 3: I cannot carry this heavy burden anymore than a young ox would sustain a load,
carried forward by a strong bull all alone."

Shlok 4: "I think this venerable point in the form of administration of the kingdom is
difficult to be controlled, as a broken dam, seeping from its cracks when breached mammoth stream
of water.

Shlok 5: O hero, the annihilator of enemies! I am not able to follow your path, any more than
a donkey would follow the gallop of a horse or a crow would take up the chase of a wild goose."

Shlok 6-8: "O mighty armed king! How a tree planted in the back yard of one's own house, even
though grown big and difficult to climb with a huge trunk and large branches, does not yield fruits
but dries up after flowering, he who planted it would not enjoy the fruit for which it was planted.
This is the analogy applied to you, if you, as a Master, would not indeed rule over us, your
servants. You can understand the meaning."

Shlok 9: "O Rama! Today, let the world see you when crowned, like the sun with its glowing
splendour, shining brilliantly at noon.

Shlok 10: May you relax and wake-up too, to the sounds of an ensemble of musical instruments,
the tinkling of ornaments strung with tiny bells and worn around the waist and anklets as well as
sweet invocation of songs.

Shlok 11: Look after, you, lordship of world here, as long as the stellar sphere revolves and
so far as the earth is spread out."

Shlok 12: Hearing the words of Bharata, Rama who conquered the cities of adversaries, accepted
his words saying "Be it so" and sat on an auspicious seat.

Shlok 13: Thereafter, on instructions from Shatrughna, skilled barbers with gentle hands who

Shlok 14-15: Bharata, having bathed first, the mighty Lakshmana, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys and
Vibhishana the king of demons took bath. Rama had his matted locks disentangled and bathed. He
stood there, shining with splendour, adorned with picturesque garlands, smeared with sandal pastes
of various colours and clothed in costly raiment.

Shlok 16: Shatrughna, the valiant and charming man, the promoter of Ikshvaku dynasty made
arrangements for personal adornment of Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 17: Then, all the noble-minded widows of Dasaratha indeed themselves personally adorned
Seetha beautifully.

Shlok 18: Thereupon, the delightful Kausalya, who was affectionate of her sons, adorned with
zeal all the wives of monkeys.

Shlok 19: Later, on the orders of Shatrughna, the charioteer by name Sumantra made his
appearance, yoking chariot to horses which were completely beautiful in all respects.

Shlok 20: Seeing the charming chariot, which emitted immaculate splendour like that of the
sun, standing before him, the mighty armed Rama, the conqueror of hostile cities, ascended it.

Shlok 21: Sugreeva and Hanuma, having splendour similar to that of Indra the lord of
celestials, after taking their bat, wore beautiful raiment as well as sparkling ear rings and
started.

Shlok 22: Endowed with all types of ornaments as well as charming ear-rings, those wives of
Sugreeva together with Seetha moved out, longing as they were, to see the city.

Shlok 23: In Ayodhya, the ministers of king Dasaratha, having placed the priest in their
front, planned everything meaningfully.

Shlok 24: Ashoka, Vijaya and Siddhartha, with a great concern, discussed about Rama's
advancement and the prosperity of the City.

Shlok 25: "You ought to do auspiciously whatever is required for the coronation of the
great-souled Rama, worthy of victory."

Shlok 26: Advising the priest in this way, all those ministers quickly started from the city,
with an intention to see Rama.

Shlok 27: The faultless Rama, mounting the excellent chariot, as Indra ascended the chariot
yoked to green-coloured horses, sallied forth to the city.

Shlok 28-29: Bharata took up the reins. Shatrughna held the parasol on Rama's head. Lakshmana
winnowed a fan. Vibhishana, the king of demons standing nearby, held a white fan, shining
brilliantly like the moon.

Shlok 30: Then, in the sky, groups of sages, celestials along with troop of the Maruts, the
host of the gods, praised Rama and sweet reverberation was heard.

Shlok 31: Thereupon, Sugreeva, the foremost of monkeys, possessing a great splendor, mounted
an elephant named Shatrunjaya, looking like a mountain.

Shlok 32: Assuming human forms and adorned with all types of ornaments, monkeys sallied forth,
mounting on mine thousand elephants.

Shlok 33: Rama, the foremost among men, accompanied by sounds of conches buzzing in the ears
and sounds of kettle-drums, proceeded to the city of Ayodhya, having a series of palaces.

Shlok 38: Men with grains of rice mixed with turmeric and thereby appearing gold in colour,
cows, maidens along with brahmanas having balls of sweets in their hands, walked in front of
Rama.

Shlok 39: Then, Rama narrated about his friendship established with Sugreeva, the power of
Hanuma and the great act of monkeys to his ministers.

Shlok 40: Hearing the well-known achievement monkeys and the commonly known strength of the
demons, the citizens of Ayodhya were astonished.

Shlok 41: Then, Rama spoke to his counselors about his meeting with Vibhishana. After
recounting it, the resplendent Rama entered Ayodhya crowded with happy and rejoiced people,
together with the monkeys.

Shlok 42: Then, the citizens hoisted flags on every house. Rama reached the beautiful palace,
paternal occupied by Ikshvaku kings.

Shlok 43-44: Approaching and entering the palace of the great-souled father, Rama the prince
offered salutation to Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi and spoke the following sweet and meaningful
words to Bharata, the foremost among the righteous:

Shlok 45: "Give this great palace of mine which looks excellent with Ashoka garden and
consisting of pearls and cat's eye-gems to Sugreeva for his stay."

Shlok 46: Hearing those words of Rama, Bharata having a true prowess, holding Sugreeva by his
hand, entered that house.

Shlok 47: Thereupon, some men as ordered by Shatrughna, quickly brought oil lamps, beds as
also mats and entered the house.

Shlok 48: Bharata of great splendour spoke to Sugreeva as follows: "O capable person! Order
the messengers to make arrangements for Rama's coronation."

Shlok 49: Sugreeva then gave four golden jars encrusted with jewels, to four leaders of
monkeys.

Shlok 50: "O monkeys! Get ready in such a way that you await my orders tomorrow at dawn, with
your water-jars filled with water from the four oceans respectively."

Shlok 51: The great souled monkeys, resembling elephants and going speedily like eagles, thus
ordered by Sugreeva, leapt quickly into the sky.

Shlok 52-53: Jambavan, Hanuma, a monkey called Vegadarshi and Rishabha brought water-jars filled
with water. They brought water from five hundred rivers with those jars.

Shlok 54: Thereafter, the energetic SusheNa brought a jar, adorned with all types of precious

Shlok 55: Rishabha brought water quickly from the southern sea in a golden jar, covered with
some stems of red sandal-wood tree.

in a large jar set with jewels.

Shlok 57: That virtuous Nala, who vied with Garuda (the king of birds) and the wind-god in
prowess, and who was endowed with all good qualities, swiftly brought water form the northern
sea.

Shlok 58: Then, Shatrughna, accompanied by the counsellors, reported to Vasishta, their chief
priest and his friends, about that water intended for Rama's coronation brought by those foremost
of monkeys.

Shlok 59: The elderly Vasistha, with diligence, along with other brahmins on his side,
prevailed upon Rama duly to occupy along with Seetha, on a seat made of precious stones.

Shlok 64-67: With which crown, long ago, Manu the emperor was adorned while he was consecrated
and with which, the kings followed in his line were successively adorned while they were coronated,
that crown studded with precious jewels, fashioned by Brahma at the beginning of creation and
dazzling with splendour, being kept according to practice on a throne adorned with many kinds of
