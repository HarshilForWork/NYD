KISHKINDA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------

[Translation] Rama in his pursuit to regain Seetha reaches Pampa Lake along with Lakshmana. Rama visualises Pampa 
Lake as a heavenly abode and narrates to Lakshmana the suffering he is undergoing due to the departure 
of Seetha, i.e., the departure of innate soul from the Supreme. Seetha is the alter ego of Rama, either 
in heaven or on earth. In heavens she is Goddess Lakshmi and she incarnates herself as Seetha on earth. 
In the first chapter of Kishkindha Kanda the elaborate description of Pampa Lake and its surroundings 
is to be taken as a two-fold narration, one pertaining to Divinity, the other to Rama, the human. The 
area of Pampa Lake metaphors with heavens, and its trees and birds with divine souls, and who incidentally 
are teachers too. The fragrant breeze metaphors with god's gift, flowers as pure knowers and knowledge, 
and the tranquil water as clear heart and so on. Rama as hero of the epic is in search of Seetha. Rama 
as god incarnate is also in search of true devotees who are entrapped in the bodies of living beings. 
The true devotees are the trees, birds, flowers, waters and other naturals except the humans who cherish 
the earthly comforts. Thus Rama's sorrowing over Seetha and Bharata is in similitude with the god's 
sorrowing for the true devotees, who needs salvation from the birth and death cycle. Hence the god incarnate 
Rama is in search of true devotee like Seetha, who is now in a distant place and needs some education 
about her release from the embodiment in Lanka. Later Rama finds Hanuma, the teacher, who will be deputed, 
to Seetha to enlighten her about her release. In the last two chapters of Aranya Kanda there will be 
some 61 verses detailing about Pampa Lake and Rama's love for Seetha. But in Gorakhpur and Eastern recessions 
there are 130 verses in this first canto of Kishkindha and some 20 verses in the fag end chapter of 
Aranya canto. In these many verses Rama expresses his deep-rooted emotion for Seetha, which the ancient 
commentators have interpreted to be the God's deep-seated love and anguish for the created souls. The 
comparison is, Rama to Vishnu, Seetha to the created soul, now captivated in the embodiment called Lanka, 
and Lakshmana as the true devout. God needs a messenger or a Messiah or as per Hindu tradition the Guru, 
the teacher. That is what Hanuma. Rama as a god incarnate is actually in search of a true teacher, for 
which the surroundings of Pampa Lake are exemplified as good surroundings for finding such a true teacher. 
As far as possible, the commentaries of ancients are given in comment section of those verses. At the 
fag end of this chapter, the mighty monkey hero Sugreeva, moving on the Rishyamuka Mountain sees Rama 
and Lakshmana entering into his territory, flees into deep forests, fearing them to be enemies.

Shlok 2: Rama, on arriving at that Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, which is full with lotuses, 
costuses, and fishes, lamented as his emotions are disturbed, on seeing the beauty of the Lake comparable 
with Seetha's face. [4-1-1]

[Commentary] In this very first verse itself the auspicious nature of the land of Kishkindha is implanted. Rama as 
hero of this epic identifies his heroine Seetha's face with the tranquil sheet of lake's water, her 
eyes with the lotuses, and her quick glances with the quick swims of the fishes in the lake. Rama as 
god incarnate observes the tranquil sheet of water as the quiescence of his creation. The red lotuses 
are meditatively standing, as the devotees ready to be taken away to the feet of their god. The swimming 
fishes are seen as the souls captivated in human bodies, rushing hither and thither for salvation, which 
is hindered by the banks of life [here the banks of the lake.] Thus on certain occasions we chance to 
meet with the different points of view of Rama, one as hero and the other as god incarnate, derived 
from the metaphors or similes by the ancient commentators.

Shlok 3: There, on seeing that Lake of Lotuses, thrilled are his senses with gladness, and he engrossed and overcame 
by passion spoke this way to Lakshmana. [4-1-2]

Shlok 4: "Oh! Soumitri, magnificent is Pampa Lake with its cat's-eye-gem like waters, and she with her fully 
bloomed lotuses and costuses is beaming forth, along with many trees around her. [3-1-3]

[Commentary] The clear water is devout-soul and the bloomed lotuses are the tranquil faces of the devotees. The water 
is like cat's eye gem. Cat's eye or Lapis Lazuli is ' a beautiful stone consisting of calcite and other 
minerals coloured ultramarine...' and a precious stone of Sri Lanka and the Malabar Coast...' thus say 
Chambers and Oxford dictionaries, and it is Indian, that too South Indian specific. It is one of the 
nine gems, in nava-ratna combination.

[Commentary] Secondly the usage of vaiduurya vimala udaka is an often-repeated expression, which may not 
be construed only that the waters are like cats-eye or Lapis Lazule, the precious gem in nava ratna/ 
nine-gem combination. In fine composition it is smaraNa alankaara , a metaphorical memorabilia. 
If it were said that the water is like vaiduurya or cat's-eye or Lapis, it reminds us of all 
other eight gems including a diamond. As such the waters are crystalline and pellucid in their look 
like priceless gems, for water is the invaluable gem-like gift of nature and flowing waters are the 
priceless possessions for livelihood as well.

Shlok 5: "Oh! Soumitri, see the forest of Pampa, the auspicious one in its appearance... where the mountains 
or trees lustre with their mountainous peaks... [4-1-4]

[Commentary] The mountainous trees are teachers, and their mountainous branches are the taught, that depend on their 
teachers, and both of they depending upon the Pampa Lake, the divine tranquil water... and everything 
depends on waters, as per Vedic saying: aapovaa idagam sarvam... waters are everything...

Shlok 6: "But I, who am well seethed by the anguish of Bharata, and even by the abduction of Seetha, am indeed 
distressed by my sensibilities and their distresses... [4-1-5]

[Commentary] In some other version like Eastern version the word Maadhava i.e., Love God Manmadha used for aadhayaH 
because the alankaara or the aesthetics demand the description of vasantha requires Manmadha. 
Then the compound is read as santaptam maadhavaH piidayanniva comes there, meaning that 'the 
Vasanta, the spring season, or the personified Manmadha, the Love God, is distressing me, besides the 
problems of anguished Bharata and abduction of Seetha.' It is said that Rama remembers Bharata too, 
along with Seetha at this juncture, because as a god incarnate He remembers the sufferance of these 
innate souls dedicated to Him. Bharata is another kainkarya /dedicatee of Rama, the divine, 
like Lakshmana.

Shlok 7: "This auspicious Pampa is pleasant to me with its delightful forests overspread with many diverse flowers, 
cool waters, though I am disquieted... [4-1-6]

[Commentary] In grief everything is disquieting, duHkhite manasi sarvam asahyam... but these pleasant floral 
environment of Pampa is admirable to Rama, because nature is divine.

Shlok 8: "Even enwreathed with lotuses this is remarkably sacred in its aspect... rambling snakes and elephants 
and restless are the deer and birds flocks, as well... [4-1-7]

[Commentary] Even though serpents etc., are there, the lake with its lotuses is pleasant. This suggests that if a 
wise-one contains a vice, he is not deplorable... teSaam tejo visheSeNa pratyavaayo na vidyate...smriti 
scriptures.

Shlok 9: "All this is shining very much with bluish, yellowish grassland with a variety of trees... and with 
flowers covering it like flowery bed-sheet with variegated colours... [4-1-8]

[Commentary] The green pasturelands have become colourful pastures with variegated flower-fall, means that the a 
mortal soul on receiving many a teaching from many teachers, where the teachers are trees and flowers 
are teachings, that mortal is becoming immortal, and becomes an abode to the Supreme soul.

Shlok 10: "Everywhere the treetops are fully flowered and the onus of those flowers is on the rise, though they 
are wholly embraced by climbers and their apices. [4-1-9]

[Commentary] A householder, though embraced by many flowery desires, will stand out, with his own flowers of wisdom, 
should he be true devotee.

Shlok 11: "Pleasing is this breeze, oh! Soumitri, and Manmadha, the Love God, prevails at this time, and prideful 
is this month with its fragrance, flowers, fruits and trees... all anew... [4-1-10]

[Commentary] The appreciation of nature is said to be of divine nature, for the Divine creates the nature that itself 
is of Divine nature. The high crowned trees are the sessile teachers and the flowers and birds are mobile 
students, who always surround the teachers. Rama in search of some good teacher to convey his message 
to the captive Seetha finds some other great teachers of nature, but whom he cannot utilise for his 
purpose because they are sessile. He however praises them while remembering Seetha. The touch of Cupid 
is for the Rama, the Hero, and the touch of anguish in search of a good teacher is for the god incarnate.

Shlok 12: "See this figuration of these forests enriched with these flowers, Soumitri! Outpouring is the flower 
rain, like the rain from rain-clouds... [4-1-11]

[Commentary] Teachers rain flowers of wisdom like rain from clouds without any seeking.

Shlok 13: "Also on those appeasing terraces of mountains there are many forest trees... speed of winds are swinging 
them to shower flowers onto ground... [4-1-12]

Shlok 14: "These are the flowers already fallen, about to fall, or still on the trees, but everywhere the air 
is playing with these flowers, see that Lakshmana... [4-1-13]

[Commentary] The word patitaH also synonyms with morally fallen. The three states of flowers viz., fallen, 
about to fall and yet to fall are not just for flowers but also for those who are in the same state 
morally. With all of them the god plays in his kriida, liila . Presently god's own attribute, 
namely the Air is playing with them, since air is the suutra , string, the thread of whole 
creation.

Shlok 15: "The honeybees are displaced when the wind rapidly moved numerous branches of trees with full of flowers, 
and though displaced those bees are singing as though in accompaniment to the singing breeze... [4-1-14]

[Commentary] The singing of honeybees or of the air amounts to the chanting of Sama Veda hymns at the sight of Absolute, 
i.e., Rama who now appeared in this environ.

Shlok 16: "Breeze coming out from those mountain caves along with the high callings of lusty black cuckoos are 
making the trees to dance, and the air itself is as though singing as an accompaniment to that dancing... 
[4-1-15]

[Commentary] The kokila is not exactly a cuckoo, for cuckoo gives out a two note call whereas the kokila gives out 
a single lengthy call with up and down of its tone, and also replies its imitative cooing of the humans. 
However it belongs to the same species of cuckoo. Here the 'air itself is singing' has the similitude 
with singing of Sama Veda hymns, which here is coming out of mountain caves, where the caves themselves 
are the abode of the hermits and sages, who sing Sama hymns. Later in the canto the monkey heroes also 
dwell in caves, and are equated with the pre-eminent teaches who always sing in the praise of God, which 
will be as good as singing the Vedic Hymns. Now the air emerging from the caverns of yonder firmaments 
is singing Sama Veda applauding Rama, the Divine.

Shlok 17: "Entwined are the spires of trees when muchly moved by the air, thus the trees themselves seem to be 
entwined one with the other... [4-1-16]

[Commentary] Entwined are the devotees in the devotion of their common Supreme.

Shlok 18: "He, this breeze is thus a happy one for touch, carrying a coolant and the fragrance like that of the 
sandalwood, and this breezing is a merited one and a fatigue remover... [4-1-17]

[Commentary] The fragrance gandha always synonyms with puNya merit. A flower emits fragrance without 
anybody's rrequest and it is its merit. The flowers of grass are forbidden for worship, for they have 
no scent. And God is said to be sarva gandhaH sarva rasaH 'He is all the fragrance, He is all 
the essence...' The appealing sounds of the birds are taken as the recitation of Sama Veda, the top 
of the trees is parama pada , the heavens, and the flowers are the knowledge-full seers, and 
the birds are the innate souls captivated in living beings. The flower is an essential item in the worship 
of any religion and in Maha Naarayana Upanishad we are told it to be carrier of moral merit unto god, 
like its fragrance that can be felt at a distance without any visible medium. According to; Maha Narayanopanishad 
Section Eleven, Hymn 1: yathaa vR^ikShasya sampuShpitasya duuraat gandhovaatievam karmaNo duuraadgandho 
vaati -- maha Narayanopanishad ||

[Commentary] Just in the same manner as the fragrance of a tree in full blossom is wafted by the wind from 
a distant place, the fragrance of meritorious deeds-- the good name that accrues from them -- spreads 
to a great distance [as far as heaven.]

[Commentary] Thus the corollary of the teacher and the taught is also applicable here. The flowers are the teachers 
and their knowledge is fragrance, where the taught are the birds whose cooing is the chanting of Sama 
Veda. The birds, as the captivated souls, are seeking salvation in their chanting around the teachers 
i.e., flowers to communicate the same to god, with their fragrant knowledge. This enthrals the god, 
now Rama.

Shlok 19: "Air is vacillating these trees in this honey scented forest... and the trees appear to be enjoying 
their fluttering dance and seem to be swinging their treetops to appreciate the singing of honeybees 
that are humming in accompaniment to this dance... [4-1-18]

Shlok 20: "On mountain-planes that are beautiful with fully flowered and pleasant tress that entwine the mountain 
peaks with their high treetops, and thus these mountains indeed liven up with these great trees...[4-1-19]

Shlok 21: "Air is moving the treetops fully covered with flowers to swinging and the coronet like honeybees have 
to swing around those treetops, thus these trees themselves appear to be dancing to be dancing and singing... 
[4-1-20]

Shlok 22: "Fully flowered are these Karnikaara plants all over with golden colour flowers at top and yellow coloured 
stems, and they look like men wearing golden ornaments on their upper body, while their loin cloth is 
yellow... [4-1-21]

Shlok 23: "This spring with the soundings of many birds, oh! Soumitri, is enkindling grief in me, for Seetha is 
disunited...[4-1-22]

[Commentary] All the innate souls are required to be in unison with the Supreme Soul, and they are not to depart 
for the worldly illusions. Seetha's illusion to possess the Golden Deer chanced for her abduction, and 
thus disunited from Rama

Shlok 24: "I, who am already pervaded by grief, am now well sweltered by the Love God, and this cuckoo that has 
happy calls is rather calling me down... [4-1-23]

[Commentary] The hero hears the call of cuckoo as heroine's call. The God is listening to the same from the beings 
of nature, as a call for salvation. Rama, who has not heard any call of Seetha so far, which he will 
hear at the end of this canto, is in wait for such a call.

Shlok 25: "This gallinule bird happily calling in the forest brooks is making me awesome with its calls, as the 
Love-god has already made me awestricken... [4-1-24]

Shlok 26: "Earlier when we were in hermitage, on hearing this bird's call, dear Seetha used to call me to listen, 
and she herself was highly cheerful at this bird's calls... [4-1-25]

Shlok 27: "Very many amusing birds of that kind are flitting all over on trees, bushes, and creepers emitting 
very many sounds... see them, Lakshmana... [4-1-26]

Shlok 1: "Well mingled are these female birds with their male ones, for which they are well admired by their 
own flock, oh! Soumitri, and such birds are calling gladsomely together with the pleasing humming of 
king-bees... [4-1-27]

[Commentary] Prof. R. D. Ranade, the eminent professor of Indian Philosophies said that "Translations are always 
bound to be uncouth; they are like a heavy cart-load which moves slowly along..." So also Ramayana, 
whose text itself is a cartload, and the translations become many more cartloads. Much can be said in 
Kishkindha Kanda, for it comprises of many a derivative, which cannot be compressed and put together. 
The hero-heroine and the god incarnate aspects, together with some Indian philosophies included, are 
sufficient to become some more cartloads. The Hindu Love-god, Manmadha, unlike his European counterpart 
Cupid, has no body. At one time, Shiva burned Him down physically, for arousing lasciviousness in Shiva 
Himself. But Shiva makes the Love-god Manmadha to thrive without a physical body, at the request of 
Love God's wife Rati. Hence Love God is also called an anga = without, body. The bodiless nature 
and only the emotive responses in love are symbolical with the formless activity of romancing aroused 
by ananga or Manmadha, i.e., Love God. Alternately the word Manmadha not necessarily be taken 
as a noun, denoting the Love God alone. As a phrasal verb it denotes, mind, churning. mann; manas; 
madhaH - mannamsi mathate iti manmathaH... to churn. There is a platform called manas 
, below the subconscious level, and above sensory organs, which receives all the input from the sensory 
organs, which the manas separates, categorises, analyses and so on, and then sends to databank at subconscious 
level. Amara Kosha defines it as cittantu ceto hR^idayam svaantam hR^in maanasam manaH || dhii vargaand 
the separation is chittam, chetaH, hridayam, svaantam, hrit, maanasam, manH and this is not 
the composite mind, but a faculty of reason, what we generally call, a heart, a mind, a thought etc. 
Hence the lamentation of Rama is more churned out of his manas for Seetha, not just for amorousness, 
but for real love. And love, as per good old saying, is togetherness. Having lost that togetherness, 
Rama is pouring out his heart churned agony. Yet again, Rama the god indulges in those that are indulged 
in Him, and here his thoughts are constantly indulged in Seetha, his alter ego in heavens and on earth. 
In the Vaishnava mythologies, Vishnu incarnating on earth always looses his consort, Goddess Lakshmi 
and roams over to find Her. It is the same situation in narasimha incarnation. Goddess Lakshmi 
is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, after which Her consort Vishnu searches and 
retrieves Her, for no one on earth can amass heavenly wealth. In Lakshmi tantra, the Vaishnava aagama 
text Lakshmi states that: aham naaraayanii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa " I am indeed 
Naaraayanee [i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Vishnu..." [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.] Hence, Seetha may 
not be taken as yet another princess from this viewpoint.

[Commentary] Vasanta or spring is a friendly season, and Kishkindha is a friendly place, [and
Rama gets more friends in this place later,] but Rama's lifetime friend and supreme essence is
missing. For god, this burning is the sensation or perception of energy as warmth shown by the
devout nature, and its blessed souls. Shaiva/Shaakta traditions emphasises the power and majesty of
the God, whereas the Vaishnava theory demands a heart pouring devotion to achieve the God's saving
grace anugraha . Hence the lamentation of Rama as god is for the departure of his Shakti,
i.e., Goddess Lakshmi, visualising all the nature and its component devotees he created, such as,
trees, peacocks, birds, flowers, waters, mountains etc. All of this nature and its components are
maddening Him for love from that Shakti.

[Commentary] This point of view requires some understanding of Vaishnava canons and some
paancharaatra aagama expositions. The readers may find them in a great essay of Prof.
Samjukta Gupta on Pancharatra, in a 'worm's eye view', [for she calls it that way,] in a book
called Mantra . It is a collection of essays on the Hindu hymns by eminent Indologists
like Frits Staal, Ellison Banks Findly et al, published by the State University of New York Press,
State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 12246. These are published under their SUNY Series in
Religious Studies, and this one is under the editorship of Harvey P. Alper.

[Commentary] For the hero in the epic, it is the want of warmth from the heroine. It may
please be noted that if Rama addresses Lakshmana in the verse, it is a dialogue. Otherwise it is to
be treated as monologue or soliloquy or aside or the character's heartfelt feelings, aimed for
communicating to us, but not to Lakshmana alone. Not all the verses are spoken to Lakshmana. It is
a kind of commixture of dramatics and narration. Here the lovelorn Rama views Ashoka trees as the
arrow of the Love god, manmadha. The Love God has five arrows and they are:

[Commentary] 1.aravinda= a lotus [nelumblum speciosum], 2. ashoka= a flower of hellebore
origin, 3. chutam= mango flower, 4.nava mallika= new jasmine, 5.neela utpala= blue costus, are the
five arrows of Manmadha.

[Commentary] (1) Aravindam flower-arrow  hits chest  (2) Asoka flower-arrow lips  (3) mango
flower-arrow head  (4) new jasmine flower-arrow eyes; (5) blue costuses hits anywhere.

[Commentary] Their functions are: -

[Commentary] The five states associated with each arrow are: -1.unmaada= maniacal state,
tapana= fervent state, 3. shoshaNa= wasting away, 4. sthambhana= standstillness, 5. 
sammohana=
stupifaction.

[Commentary] The Ashoka flower kills natual hunger, Jasmine desciccates, mango flower fades
the colour, and lotusess causes criss-cross thinking, and the costuses incite the desire for
suicide.

[Commentary] The iridescent eye like spots on the back plumage of the peacock are said to be like a gavaaksha, go aksha  cow, eye. There used to be cow-eye like ventilators on the walls of ancient house to permit the 
air to circulate. Even a single feather of peacock is called the eye of the peacock for its glittering 
eye like spot. Here the air is permeating these eyes on the plumage of peacock and making those eyes 
look like crystals. Thus the spring breeze is permeating anywhere, including Rama, causing a want for 
the togetherness with Seetha. Unlike other birds, the peacocks do not mate often and in open. It has 
some ritual like dancing and secret in its conduct of mating.

Shlok 43: "Living in this flowering month is unbearable for me... Lakshmana, see the fondness even in those originated 
in animals, thus that peahen in her passion is following her husband... [4-1-41b, 42]

Shlok 44: "Had she, that broad eyed lady Seetha, not been abducted, she too would have followed me in this way 
with an ecstatic love... [4-1-43]

Shlok 45: "See Lakshmana, while these forests are abundantly weighty with flowers in wintry season these flowers 
are becoming futile to me... [4-1-44]

Shlok 46: "Though these flowers on the trees are exceedingly beautiful they are falling onto the earth wastefully, 
along with the swarms of honeybees hovering over them... [4-1-45.]

Shlok 47: "These blithesome birds appear to be inviting each other in mutual consent, and they are melodious calling 
as they like, and this is causing love madness in me... [4-1-46]

[Commentary] The calling of the birds in-groups suggests the harmonious prayers by the devotees, which is maddening 
the god to accord salvation to so many of them.

Shlok 48: "Should this spring season be there too, where my dear one Seetha is living, she with her unrequited 
merriment will definitely be saddened like me... [4-1-47]

Shlok 49: "Definitely this spring season will not touch that place where she is... and even if this touches that 
place, how can that lady with black-lotus-eyes can possibly comport without me! [4-1-48]

Shlok 50: "Otherwise, even if the spring happens to be there where my dear is, what can that fine waisted lady 
do under threat by others? [4-1-49]

Shlok 51: "She in midst of her youth, eyes like lotus petals, also soft-spoken one is my dear one... and definitely 
taken by the spring she leaves her life... [4-1-50]

Shlok 52: "Indeed in my heart a strong notion is prevailing that the chaste lady Seetha will be unable to live 
separated from me... [4-1-51]

Shlok 53: "My thoughts of Seetha alone are well biding in me, and in Seetha also thoughts about me will always 
be abiding... [4-1-52.]

Shlok 54: "This breeze carrying fragrance of flowers is though pleasant for touch and though coolish like snow, 
this alone is like fire to me as I am very much worried about that lady... [4-1-53]

Shlok 55: "By which breeze I always felt happiness earlier along with Seetha... that breeze alone is increasing 
anguish in me without Seetha... [4-1-54]

Shlok 56: "When Seetha was with me, then this crow flew into the sky and cawed much indicating Seetha's departure 
from me, and now sitting on a tree it is cawing agreeably indicating early arrival of Seetha... [4-1-55]

Shlok 57: "This bird alone, then roving in the sky indicated about the abduction of Seetha... and this very same 
bird will now lead me near to that broad eyed one... [4-1-56]

[Commentary] "The boons and curses in Ramayana" is an exclusive subject and there are a variety of books on these 
subjects. So also, the prognostications are another subject. Special attention will be paid to the cawing 
of the crow, for Rama blessed the crow. A crow is said to have requested Rama to remove its ugly look. 
Rama instead of blessing the crow to look like a white-swan blessed it to be proficient in foretelling. 
The crow's cawing is for both good and bad omens, which even now is an accepted belief. If the crow 
roves over in the sky continuously cawing, it is bad omen. If it sits on nearby tree or wall and caws 
incessantly, it is good omen to get desired things or to indicate the arrival of dear ones etc. Such 
prognostications are available by way of bad dreams etc., at many places in Ramayana.

Shlok 58: "Lakshmana, observe the appealing tonality of birds in the forest that calling out atop the flowered 
trees, that which is indeed furthering one's passionï¿½ [4-1-57]

Shlok 59: "That honeybee is quickly reaching these red flowers bouquets of Tilaka that are like his loved ones 
that are raising their faces with vigourï¿½[4-1-58]

[Commentary] The true devotee quickly grasps the nectar of knowledge from the teacher like the honeybee 
that quickly grasps the nectar of the flower, however vagrant the flower may be.

Shlok 60: "To the impassioned ones that Ashoka tree is very much enhancing grief, and with its bouquets of flowers 
hustled up by the wind it is sanding as though to daunt me... [4-1-59]

Shlok 61: " Lakshmana, these mango trees bearing greenish yellow flower are appearing like men whose hearts are 
flirtatiously aroused, and who have creamed their bodies with greenish-yellow body creamï¿½ [4-1-60]

Shlok 62: "Oh, tigerly man Soumitri, see these Pampa's amazing forests ranges... and therein the nymphs are moving, 
hither and yon... [4-1-61]

Shlok 63: "See Lakshmana, these fragrant and propitious blue lotuses are everywhere in the waters, glistening 
like tender sun... [4-1-62]

Shlok 64: "This Pampa Lake is shining forth with its tranquil waters, that contain lotuses, blue water-lily's, 
and red lotuses, along with swans and water-birds that permeate it ï¿½ [4-1-63]

Shlok 65: "Lotuses with the resplendence of tender sun enwrapping its waters, pollen grain pilfered by honeybees 
enwrapping those lotusesï¿½ with them this Pampa is beaming forthï¿½

Shlok 66: "This Pampa is always bedecked with the ruddy geese, amazing deep areas of the forest, and with water 
thirsty herds of elephants and deer, and with them it gleams forth... [4-1-65]

[Commentary] There is a discussion whether Pampa is a lake or a river. There are two rivers in Karnataka State of 
India, one Tunga and the other Bhadra, at whose confluence it is called Tunga Bhadra. The Vijayanagara 
Empire built their capital Hampi at this place. The regional language Kannada uses ' ha ' for Sanskrit 
' pa ' and hence Pampa is now called Hampi. Long before Vijayanagara dynasty, this place is ascribed 
to be Pampa, where the Kishkinda, the capital of monkey kings was situated. "The kingdom of Vanara or 
monkey race was in the north and west of Mysore, their chief city being Kishkindha near the village 
of Hampi on Tungabhadra..." Mysore and Conty Vol. I, page.178--Reie Vol. I pg. 146, and also in Bombay 
Gazetteer Vol. I pg. 142 of Dr. Bhandarkar. There are four copper plate inscriptions, dating around 
3012 BC, at Shimoga District, Karnataka State, ascribing that Janamejaya, son of Parikshat makes grants 
to the Pampa area, because his great grand father Yudhisthara of Maha Bharata rested on the banks of 
Tungabhadra at this place. However there is a vast lake like formation at present day Hospet and Hampi 
in Karnataka State, where three rivers, namely Tungabhadra, Varada and Hagari and their tributaries 
etc., meet and disperse. This place is geographically at Long. 76ï¿½--78ï¿½, and Lat. 12ï¿½--16ï¿½.

Shlok 67: "In the tranquil water the speed of wind is throbbing ripples, and the ripples throb the lotuses, thus 
the throbbing and rippling lotuses appear beautifulï¿½ [4-1-66]

Shlok 68: "That one with lotus-petal-like broad eyes, who always holds the lotuses dear...without finding that 
Vaidehi... to me my life is uninteresting... [4-1-67]

[Commentary] Rama's tranquil heart is throbbing like the ripples in the waters, because the resident in that lotus 
like heart, Seetha is missing. Goddess Lakshmi sits in the lotus holding lotuses, like the pollen, and 
the vast lake of tranquil waters is the heart of Vishnu.

Shlok 69: "Aha! Deplorable is the deviousness of Love-god, for he is causing reminisces about that graceful lady

Shlok 73: "This breezeï¿½ let out from within the thickets of forests, breezing touching the pollen of lotuses, 
is reminding Seetha's exhale, as such it is heart-stealingï¿½ [4-1-72]

[Commentary] This verse is well explained by the ancient commentators in many derivatives. Some of them are:

[Commentary] 1] Rama wanted to take comfort in the breeze, at least. But that 
breeze itself is troubling him, because it is carrying the fragrance of the pollen of lotuses, which 
is like the fragrance of Seetha's breath. surabhi nishvashite dadatahtrishaam as in laxana shaastra 
. Exhale of the beloved bears a kind of fragrance, which is known only to her lover. Seetha also holds 
the lotus dear and every aspect of Seetha is lotus oriented and thus Rama's remembering of Seetha by 
seeing lotuses. [Ibid. satatam priya pankajaam - 4-1-67.]

[Commentary] 2] Goddess Lakshmi sits in the middle of the lotus, which will 
be in the heart of Vishnu. As of now She is stolen and Rama could not avert it. Hence the lotuses are 
angered at the loss of their resident Goddess Lakshmi, are taking the help of the breeze to carry the 
scent of the pollen, which is akin to Seetha's breath, and invade Rama's heart, to regain their tenant. 
Then a question arises as to why Rama confronts the invasion of this spring breeze without going away 
from there. In reply it is said that this breeze is like Seetha's breath, and it is coming from out 
of the thickets of the forests. So she must be around and appear to him any moment. Regaining Seetha 
is prime ordeal than the invasion of the cool spring breeze.3] Another way of putting this is: -- padma = Goddess Lakshmi; 
kesara - or - kesaraiH = affection, like fragrant pollen; samshR^iSTaH = carrying; 
vR^iksha antara vi nisshruta = tree of the Universe, within it, emitted; nishvaasa iva = uninterrupted breathe, like; 
siithaayaa = of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,] 
vaayuH = all-pervading 
ether [mythical]; manaH = [sins of] heart; haraH = stealing/obliterating one.
This is based on the ashwattha structure of the Universe.

1 uurdhva muulo'vaak shaakha eSho ashvatthaH sanaatanaH || 2-6-1 - kaThopanishad2 uurthvamuulam 
athaH shaakham ashvattha~N praahuravyaya~N ||15_1-3 - bhagavadgiita

 
The roots of Aswattha tree [the Holy fig tree, Ficus Religiosa, 
meaning that: shva = tomorrow; na stha = not there; the tree of the Universe that will not be 
there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves 
spread upside down as this Universe. This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess 
Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading 
ether, within the tree i.e., Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed 
with Her affection, but becomes a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for 
obliteration of his sins and to accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to 
the Almighty, than indulging in earthly cherishing. This is termed as nirhetuka satata dyaa prasaara 
i.e., without any precondition the grace of Goddess Lakshmi always flows.

The mountains always have similitude with kings as they stand high and noble on the land. The Himalaya 
is King Himavant, the father of Goddess Parvati, Shiva's consort. So also here the Rishyamuka Mountain, 
where Sugreeva takes asylum, is termed as a kingly mountain and Rama has not yet known the name of this 
mountain. On this mountain there are coloured dust splashes hiding the greenery of leaves, and the flowers 
are luminous in red colour, all over. This is indicating that the Kingly Mountain Rishyamuka is inviting 
the other King Rama or Rama the divine, with an incensed camphor, that will be red in glow and emits 
coloured smoke. This is the mangala aarati , the auspicious camphor-torch deference offered to kings 
of deities.

mama = desire, kindling, in me.

"Entering the blessed waters this bird, partridge, is rejoicing together with his female, kindling desire 
in me too... [4-1-93]

The question of self-control of Rama in indulgence is discussed here. Rama's libido is not expressed 
after the abduction of Seetha, until his entry into the area of Pampa or its forests. Here, in these 
surroundings of Pampa, the spring season is at its height and the nature is adding fire to his fuelling 
desire. What anyone can do but to lament about his unconsummated desire? That too, when Manmadha, the 
Love God, assumes the charge of this particular Chaitra month, or spring season, it is impossible to 
play-act celibacy. For more details about such a condition, Gosvami Tulasi Das is perhaps the best poet 
to narrate in Ram Charita Manas, at Doha 73 to 76 of Baala Kaanda. Narrated in there is, that the saints 
and sages lost their loincloths, chastity belts peeled off on their own, and entire social order went 
topsy-turvy, when Manmadha took charge of the Universe for only a few moments, to kindle Shiva's love 
towards Parvati. As such the nature at Pampa itself has become a love god to Rama, to pour out his passion 
for Seetha.

"This sort of heart pleasing nature is also available with River Ganga, and that alone reasonably signifies 
the popularity of River Pampa in the world... [4-1-94]

Mahesvara Tirtha records the meaning of this verse in another way. "If this sort of love kindling atmosphere 
is there to River Ganga, it would have been the world's best environ..." But River Ganga is a Holy one 
and this environ cannot be there. This stanza signifies that Pampa is a river but not a vast lake, and 
all these narrations of longing epitomises the longing for a true friend like Sugreeva or Hanuma, or 
for Rama's life-mate Seetha.

95. Raghu uttama = Raghu's, best from - Lakshmana; saadhvii = devoted lady; yadi

reside, indeed; shakraaya = not, Indra's [throne]; na sprR^iha yeyam = I think of,

"If that devot lady Seetha is found, and also if we were to stay here only, I neither think about Indra's 
throne in Heavens nor Ayodhya's throne, which is like Indra's throne on the earth... [4-1-95]

The word shakraaya is in Dative case, meaning that the throne of Ayodhya is meant for an Indra-like 
ruler on earth, and qualifies for a demonstrative adjectival expression in its adjacency principle. 
As such Rama is pondering over negating the kingdom, i.e., the Rajya Lakshmi, in comparison with Seetha, 
who is his Bhaagya Lakshmi. Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsha, depicts what this Bhagya Lakshmi has to say, when 
Rama, basing on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject deserts Seetha.

upasthitaam puurvam apaasya lakShmiim vanam mayaa saarthamasi prapannaH |tadaaspadam praapya tayaati 
roShaat soDhaa asmi na tad bhavane vasantii ||raghuvamsha, XIV.63

" Earlier, you refused the kingdom-fortune, [Rajya Lakshmi,] and came to forests, where I was with you. 
Now that, that kingdom-fortune, Rajya Lakshmi winning your affection, is jealous of me i.e., Bhagya 
Lakshmi, and she does not let me live in your palace.

Seetha is an unusual princess by birth. Winning her hand in marriage is unusually preconditioned by 
King Janaka with the lifting of Shiva's bow, which none else could do than Rama. Having won Seetha's 
hand in marriage, but lost her in the forest, will be ridiculous. Rama reflects here as to how his father-in-law 
King Janaka would lookdown Rama for not protecting his daughter Seetha.

dur anvaya - wrong parsing of words in verse

The above is the wrong orientation of words used in above two verses. While the word-to-word translation 
of Ramayana is rare in print medium, the prose versions are giving meanings with such orientation, and 
they will be usually found in almost all printed books. The above suggests that Lakshmana is asking 
Rama to forget Seetha, which is meaningless. The following is said to be the reasonable orientation. 
Other words being same, the rest are:

priya jane= in dear, ones; sneham smR^itvaa= fondness, on remembering; iidR^ishaanaam= for this kind 
of; a + kaluSa atmaanaam= of un, blemished, souls; matiH mandaa na bhavati= intellect, languorous, will 
not, become; viyogajam duHkham tyaja= by separation, caused sadness, leave off.

"On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become 
languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation.

Such wrong orientations of words used in verses will be found in other verses also, because printed 
books are carrying them forward, and they need correction by some pundits who can kindly spare time 
and effort. The above correction is per courtesy of : Pt. Paturi Sitaramaanjaneyulu

Thus addressed by Lakshmana, then Rama whose conscience is marred by emotions, got rid of pity and fondness, 
and acquired courage, to perform the deed demanded of his incarnation. [4-1-124]

This reflects the saying of Bhagavad Gita gataasun agataasuumscha naanu shochanti panditaH... 
Lakshmana repeats the same words in Yuddha Kanda, the Book of War, chapter 83, verse 43, when Rama laments 
on receiving information that Indrajit, the son of Ravana killed Seetha. Here the word shoka 
' stands for pity and moha stands for fondness, and god has these two basic attributes towards 
His creation. Thus the pity and fondness of god is now aimed at releasing the innate soul, namely Seetha, 
from the captivation.

This episode is a construct on the hymn at 1-4-3 inBrihadaaranyaka 
Upanishadic which is as below: --

savai na rame | tasmaat ekaakii na ramate | sa dvitiiyam aicchat |sahaitaavaanaasayathaa strii pumaamsau 
sampariShvaktau |----tataHpatishca patniicaa bhavataam ---tatomanuShyo ajaayanta---BR^ihadaaraNyakopaniShad 1-4-3

God is said to take no delight in Himself alone, and He desired another.He was like an embraced male 
and female. Man and wife. Hence He felled His body to become twoâ¦ and from thereon humans originatedâ¦Brihadaaranyaka 
Upanishat 1-4-3.

The lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing 
to have His first creation with himself. This is for deifying Rama as incarnation of Vishnu. All the 
Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama's reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the 
same import. In Skanda Purana there is yet another instance stating that Rama gave curses to such lusty 
components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -

vaimukhyam gandha phalyaastu bhramaraan ashapat prabhuH |kokaan 
nishiidhevishlesham pikam anya vivardhanam |candanam sarpa nilayam vaayum sarpa ashanam tathaa|
jyostnaam kaÂ¹a~Nka sa~ncchannaanaam shashaasa raghu nandana | skandapuraaNa

"Champaka flowers [Hindi: Mogra; Telugu : Sampega; Botanical : 
Michelia champaka] are not to be touched by Honeybees, chakravaaka, [water-birds, ruddy geese, know 
for their inseparable swimming] be separated in midnight, Kokila birds [Blackcuckoos] be grownup in 
other's nests [i.e., in crow's nest] Sandalwood trees become shelters to snakes, the breeze [that is 
cool and incited Rama's thoughts about Seetha,]shall become food of snakesâ¦ thus cursed Rama, in his 
anguish about his separation from Seethaâ¦" Skanda Purana.

Â© 2000, Desiraju Hanumanta Rao [Revised - March 04]

[Commentary] 3] Another way of putting this is: -- padma = Goddess Lakshmi; 
kesara - or - kesaraiH = affection, like fragrant pollen; samshR^iSTaH = carrying; 
vR^iksha antara vi nisshruta = tree of the Universe, within it, emitted; nishvaasa iva = uninterrupted breathe, like; 
siithaayaa = of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,] 
vaayuH = all-pervading 
ether [mythical]; manaH = [sins of] heart; haraH = stealing/obliterating one.

[Commentary] This is based on the ashwattha structure of the Universe.

[Commentary] The roots of Aswattha tree [the Holy fig tree, Ficus Religiosa, 
meaning that: shva = tomorrow; na stha = not there; the tree of the Universe that will not be 
there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves 
spread upside down as this Universe. This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess 
Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading 
ether, within the tree i.e., Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed 
with Her affection, but becomes a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for 
obliteration of his sins and to accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to 
the Almighty, than indulging in earthly cherishing. This is termed as nirhetuka satata dyaa prasaara 
i.e., without any precondition the grace of Goddess Lakshmi always flows.

Shlok 74: "Soumitri, see those flowered Karnikara trees with their tree-trunks on those southern hill-terraces 
of Pampa, they are highly splendorous... [4-1-73]

Shlok 75: "That one, that kingly mountain which is ornamentally impregnated with ores and minerals is exhausting 
much mass of wondrous dust with the colour of its ores, that is drifted by the wind's speed... [4-1-74]

Shlok 76: "On the mountainsides, Soumitri, all over fully flowered are the exquisite Kimshuka trees, while their 
leaves are hidden under those reddish flowers, and with them that mountain is as though aglow... [4-1-75]

[Commentary] The mountains always have similitude with kings as they stand high and noble on the land. The Himalaya 
is King Himavant, the father of Goddess Parvati, Shiva's consort. So also here the Rishyamuka Mountain, 
where Sugreeva takes asylum, is termed as a kingly mountain and Rama has not yet known the name of this 
mountain. On this mountain there are coloured dust splashes hiding the greenery of leaves, and the flowers 
are luminous in red colour, all over. This is indicating that the Kingly Mountain Rishyamuka is inviting 
the other King Rama or Rama the divine, with an incensed camphor, that will be red in glow and emits 
coloured smoke. This is the mangala aarati , the auspicious camphor-torch deference offered to kings 
of deities.

Shlok 77: "On the banks of Pampa these jasmines, water-lilies, red oleanders have grown up and they are now flowered 
that is wetted with the fragrance of nectar...[4-1-76]

Shlok 78: "The Mogra bushes, Sinduka, Vaasanti are well flowered. Maadhavi, flowers are also fully fragrant, and 
everywhere there are bushes of Jasmine... [4-1-77]

Shlok 79: "Charming are the saplings of Bilva, and Madhooka, and plants like Vakula, Champaka, Tilaka, Naaga trees 
are well flowered.... [4-1-78]

Shlok 80: "Padmaka plants are well flourishing, and like that Neela, Ashoka are also flowered... trees on the 
mountain terraces namely Lodhra trees are brownish like lion's mane... [4-1-79]

Shlok 81: "The trees of Alangium, Kurntaka, Poornaka, Devadaaru, and also the Mango trees, and like that Patala 
trees, and the trees of Mountain ebony are flowered...[4-1-80]

Shlok 82: "Muchukunda trees, also Arjuna trees are seen on mountain terraces...Date palm trees, Uddaalaka trees 
also... like that the Shiriisha tree, simshupa trees, and dhava trees... [4-1-81]

Shlok 83: "Silk cotton trees, palaasha trees also, like that are red mehandi trees, thus are Tinisha and Naktamaala 
trees, sandalwood trees, spandana trees are all thus well flowered... [4-1-82]

Shlok 88: "And the honeybee on assessing each of the flower as 'this one is pure... this one is delicious... and 
this one is well bloomed...' is plunging into them... [4-1-87b, 88a]

Shlok 89: "On plunging into the flowers that nectar-avaricious honeybee is again coming up, and quickly going 
elsewhere in the trees on the banks of Pampa... [4-1-8]

Shlok 90: "These clusters of flowers that have fallen on their own are spreading out like a bed of flowers laid 
on, with them the ground appears to endow comfort... [4-1-89]

Shlok 91: "On mountain slopes varied flowers are spread out, with them the colour of diverse mountain slabs is 
rendered into yellow-red hue... [4-1-90]

Shlok 92: "Soumitri see the bloom of flowers in spring after winter, as if the trees have indeed bore the flowers 
in competition with one another... [4-1-91]

Shlok 93: "The drones of honeybees among the trees with flowered treetops appear to be the talk of trees, and 
the swinging branches of trees appear to be their invitational gestures to one another, thus those trees 
look highly attractive... [4-1-92]

Shlok 94: "Entering the blessed waters this bird, partridge, is rejoicing together with his female, kindling desire 
in me too... [4-1-93]

[Commentary] The question of self-control of Rama in indulgence is discussed here. Rama's libido is not expressed 
after the abduction of Seetha, until his entry into the area of Pampa or its forests. Here, in these 
surroundings of Pampa, the spring season is at its height and the nature is adding fire to his fuelling 
desire. What anyone can do but to lament about his unconsummated desire? That too, when Manmadha, the 
Love God, assumes the charge of this particular Chaitra month, or spring season, it is impossible to 
play-act celibacy. For more details about such a condition, Gosvami Tulasi Das is perhaps the best poet 
to narrate in Ram Charita Manas, at Doha 73 to 76 of Baala Kaanda. Narrated in there is, that the saints 
and sages lost their loincloths, chastity belts peeled off on their own, and entire social order went 
topsy-turvy, when Manmadha took charge of the Universe for only a few moments, to kindle Shiva's love 
towards Parvati. As such the nature at Pampa itself has become a love god to Rama, to pour out his passion 
for Seetha.

Shlok 95: "This sort of heart pleasing nature is also available with River Ganga, and that alone reasonably signifies 
the popularity of River Pampa in the world... [4-1-94]

[Commentary] Mahesvara Tirtha records the meaning of this verse in another way. "If this sort of love kindling atmosphere 
is there to River Ganga, it would have been the world's best environ..." But River Ganga is a Holy one 
and this environ cannot be there. This stanza signifies that Pampa is a river but not a vast lake, and 
all these narrations of longing epitomises the longing for a true friend like Sugreeva or Hanuma, or 
for Rama's life-mate Seetha.

Shlok 96: "If that devot lady Seetha is found, and also if we were to stay here only, I neither think about Indra's 
throne in Heavens nor Ayodhya's throne, which is like Indra's throne on the earth... [4-1-95]

[Commentary] The word shakraaya is in Dative case, meaning that the throne of Ayodhya is meant for an Indra-like 
ruler on earth, and qualifies for a demonstrative adjectival expression in its adjacency principle. 
As such Rama is pondering over negating the kingdom, i.e., the Rajya Lakshmi, in comparison with Seetha, 
who is his Bhaagya Lakshmi. Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsha, depicts what this Bhagya Lakshmi has to say, when 
Rama, basing on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject deserts Seetha.

[Commentary] " Earlier, you refused the kingdom-fortune, [Rajya Lakshmi,] and came to forests, where I was with you. 
Now that, that kingdom-fortune, Rajya Lakshmi winning your affection, is jealous of me i.e., Bhagya 
Lakshmi, and she does not let me live in your palace.

Shlok 97: "Nay... if I were to take delight this way in these pleasant green meadows along with her, there will 
be no worry to me... nor interest in other things... [4-1-96]

Shlok 98: "Indeed these beautifully leaved and variously flowered trees are maddening my heart as I am without 
that lady Seetha in this forest... [4-1-97]

Shlok 99: "See the cool water of this Pampa Lake, Soumitri, filled with blue lotuses, and with ruddy geese well 
moving in, and well venerated by the partridge birds...[4-1-98]

Shlok 100: "Well filled with waterfowls, curlew birds, and adored by great animals, this Pampa glistens much with 
pleasantly calling birds...[4-1-99]

Shlok 101: "Enkindling passion in me, are these umpteen gladdened birds, reminding me of my dear one who is in 
the mid of her youth, moonfaced, and with the radiance of lotuses in her eyes... [4-1-100]

Shlok 102: "See that female deer along with male deer moving there and there on those wonderful mountainsides... 
and at me, who am weaned away from such a fawn-eyed lady Seetha... and such as I am, my heart is further 
agonised on seeing these wide-eyed deer, and for not seeing her, the wide-eyed Seetha... [4-1-101]

Shlok 103: "If only I can see that lady on those spectacular terraces filled with impassioned bird groups with 
much ado, then there shall be peace for me... [4-1-102]

Shlok 104: "I live along for sure, Soumitri, if that slender-waisted Vaidehi basks in this benignant breeze of 
Pampa along with me... [4-1-103]

Shlok 105: ""Lakshmana, the breeze from the greenswards of Pampa that carries the fragrance of lotuses including 
that of red lotuses is an auspicious one, an eliminator of melancholy, and those that adore such a breeze 
are fortunate ones... [4-1-104]

[Commentary] Another rendering is: padma red lotuses', sougandhika of costuses, vaham 
= fragrance carrying, i.e. carrying the fragrance of many flowers as though in a garland of flowers 
on its chest; shivam pure, uncontaminated breeze, i.e., the first breeze of the season. 
dhanyaaH fortunate, sevante those that await and adore. Those couples that await this 
first breeze, emerging from the gardens of Pampa Lake, carrying fragrance of many a flower, like that 
of a garland of flowers, are fortunate.

Shlok 106: "That youthful, lotus-petal eyed beloved of mine, that Janaka's daughter... how can that helpless lady 
bear her lives without me... [4-1-105]

Shlok 107: "What sort of well-being can I say to that virtuous and truth speaking King Janaka, if he enquires about 
Seetha's well-being among hosts of people? [4-1-106]

[Commentary] Seetha is an unusual princess by birth. Winning her hand in marriage is unusually preconditioned by 
King Janaka with the lifting of Shiva's bow, which none else could do than Rama. Having won Seetha's 
hand in marriage, but lost her in the forest, will be ridiculous. Rama reflects here as to how his father-in-law 
King Janaka would lookdown Rama for not protecting his daughter Seetha.

Shlok 108: "She who accompanied me, an unfortunate one whom his father sent to forests, taking up a virtuous course... 
now where will be she, that ladylove of mine, be abiding... [4-1-107]

Shlok 109: "Whose kingdom is forfeited, and whose soul succumbed to the circumstance at the time of exile, but 
she accompanied suchlike me, and Lakshmana, without her how I can I live on in desolation... [4-1-108]

Shlok 110: "She who has a pretty and beaming face with lotus-like eyes, that is fragrant, auspicious and scarless, 
and not seeing such a face my mind is as though sinking... [4-1-109]

Shlok 111: " Lakshmana, when can I hear that conversation of Vaidehi that will have smiles and wits in between... 
wisdom wise pleasing, friendly and unique one in its own way... [4-1-110]

Shlok 112: "That youthful and decent lady though succumbed to suffering in forests used to look as though got rid 
of her sufferings, and as though gladsome woman, and she used to speak to me, one smitten by her love, 
very fondly... [4-1-111]

Shlok 113: "What can I say in Ayodhya to that kind hearted lady and my mother Kausalya, oh, prince Lakshmana, when 
she asks ï¿½where is she, my daughter-in-law? And how is she? ' [4-1-112]

Shlok 114: "Begone! Lakshmana.... you may see Bharata, that affectionate one for his brothers... I may not be able 
to live on leaving off Seetha... isn't so!" [So said Rama to Lakshmana] [4-1-113]

Shlok 115: To that great-souled Rama who is bewailing that way like a waif, his brother Lakshmana said these appropriate 
and infallible words. [4-1-114]

Shlok 116: "Oh, best one among men, please control yourself Rama, let safety betide you, do not lament, the intellect 
of your kind of unblemished souls does not become languorous... [4-1-115]

[Commentary] The above is the wrong orientation of words used in above two verses. While the word-to-word translation 
of Ramayana is rare in print medium, the prose versions are giving meanings with such orientation, and 
they will be usually found in almost all printed books. The above suggests that Lakshmana is asking 
Rama to forget Seetha, which is meaningless. The following is said to be the reasonable orientation. 
Other words being same, the rest are:

Shlok 117: "On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become 
languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation.

[Commentary] Such wrong orientations of words used in verses will be found in other verses also, because printed 
books are carrying them forward, and they need correction by some pundits who can kindly spare time 
and effort. The above correction is per courtesy of : Pt. Paturi Sitaramaanjaneyulu

Shlok 118: "If Ravana goes to the netherworlds, or still deeper worlds from there, oh my brother, still he will 
not live, Raghava... [4-1-117]

Shlok 119: "Let the emplacement of that sinning demon e obtained... and then he either cedes Seetha or enters into 
his own doom... [4-1-118]

Shlok 120: "Even if he enters the womb of Diti along with Seetha, and if he does not give away Seetha, even there 
I wish to slay him,...[4-1-119]

[Commentary] Please refer to Ch 45- 46 of Bala Kanda of details about Diti and someone entering her womb.

Shlok 121: "May you rejuvenate and be secure, oh, revered one, cast-off your pathetic mood... result of purpose 
will be lost indeed, for the endeavourers without a try, thus nothing can be regained by them... [4-1-120]

Shlok 122: "Vehemence is might, oh, noble one, there is no superior might than vehemence and to him with vehemence 
there is no impossibility in the world,... even the slightest... [4-1-121]

Shlok 123: "Vehement men do not regress in deeds, and taking hold of vehemence alone we regain Seetha...[4-1-122]

Shlok 124: "You leave off this enclosure of ardency and pushback that compassion ... you are not able to know your 
great and controlled soul...with these thoughts of self-pity and fondness... [4-1-123]

Shlok 125: Thus addressed by Lakshmana, then Rama whose conscience is marred by emotions, got rid of pity and fondness, 
and acquired courage, to perform the deed demanded of his incarnation. [4-1-124]

[Commentary] This reflects the saying of Bhagavad Gita gataasun agataasuumscha naanu shochanti panditaH... 
Lakshmana repeats the same words in Yuddha Kanda, the Book of War, chapter 83, verse 43, when Rama laments 
on receiving information that Indrajit, the son of Ravana killed Seetha. Here the word shoka 
' stands for pity and moha stands for fondness, and god has these two basic attributes towards 
His creation. Thus the pity and fondness of god is now aimed at releasing the innate soul, namely Seetha, 
from the captivation.

Shlok 126: He that inestimable valiant Rama strode forward those areas of charming Pampa Lake, with the charm of 
wind-flopped trees, getting rid of grief. [4-1-125]

Shlok 127: That great one Rama on observing all over quickly, all round the forest with its brooks and caves, and 
reviewing with Lakshmana, though agonised at heart that anguished one travelled on. [4-1-126]

Shlok 128: While that great soul Rama is walking ahead, that great souled Lakshmana whose stride is also like that 
of an elephant, and whose deeds are agreeable to Rama, vigilantly protected Rama with an un-despaired 
mind and even by his virtue and strength. [4-1-127]

Shlok 129: He who is the chief of Vanara-s, who moves about Mt. Rishyamuka, while he is meandering thereabout he 
happened to see those two who are so amazing for a look, namely Rama and Lakshmana, by which he is so 
frightened that he is petrified. [4-1-128]

Shlok 130: On seeing those two Rama and Lakshmana who are advancing his way, he that great soul who is a tree-branch 
animal, and he who strides like an elephant, derived profound agony that muffled him in worry, and he 
is engulfed under the weight of his fear. [4-1-129]

[Commentary] This is for the entrance of Rama and Lakshmana into the life of 
Sugreeva.

[Commentary] This episode is a construct on the hymn at 1-4-3 inBrihadaaranyaka 
Upanishadic which is as below: --

[Commentary] God is said to take no delight in Himself alone, and He desired another.He was like an embraced male 
and female. Man and wife. Hence He felled His body to become twoâ¦ and from thereon humans originatedâ¦Brihadaaranyaka 
Upanishat 1-4-3.

[Commentary] The lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing 
to have His first creation with himself. This is for deifying Rama as incarnation of Vishnu. All the 
Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama's reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the 
same import. In Skanda Purana there is yet another instance stating that Rama gave curses to such lusty 
components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -

[Commentary] "Champaka flowers [Hindi: Mogra; Telugu : Sampega; Botanical : 
Michelia champaka] are not to be touched by Honeybees, chakravaaka, [water-birds, ruddy geese, know 
for their inseparable swimming] be separated in midnight, Kokila birds [Blackcuckoos] be grownup in 
other's nests [i.e., in crow's nest] Sandalwood trees become shelters to snakes, the breeze [that is 
cool and incited Rama's thoughts about Seetha,]shall become food of snakesâ¦ thus cursed Rama, in his 
anguish about his separation from Seethaâ¦" Skanda Purana.
