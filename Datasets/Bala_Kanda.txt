BALA KANDA
==================================================



SARGA 1
------------------------------



Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.



Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
identified with the 24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
letter ta an auspicious letter.

Shlok 1: The ascetic Valmiki inquired Naarada - 'who engaged deeply in austerity and study of Vedas, best among the eloquent and eminent among sages' (as follows:). [1-1-1]

[Commentary] The epic starts with the word auspicious word ta as said in 'takaarovighnanaashakaH', 
	'takaarosaukhyadaayakaH'...

Shlok 2: "Who really is that person in this present world, who is virtuous and vigorous, a conscientious 
	one, one who is mindful of good deeds done to him, and also a speaker of truth and who is determined in his deed... [1-1-2]

Shlok 3: "Who is appropriate in disposition... who is interested in welfare of all beings... who is 
	adept and also an able one... also uniquely pleasant to look at... [1-1-3]

[Commentary] The adeptness of that person is in his knowing all the knowable aspects in this world, and he must be 
able to retain that knowledge to translate into his deeds, not just to sit back with his bookish knowledge, 
but with utmost practicality. His conduct-wise character shall be acceptable i.e., by his lineage he 
shall be noble, by his education he must be well-read, by his actions they must be conducive to norms 
laid down in Veda-s, and thus given any area, he should conduct himself properly. And he must be benign 
not only to higher-ups but to lowly subjects, like Guha, Shabari et al., and he should deal with wrongdoers 
and right-doers conscientiously. Further, he in his mien he shall be pleasant, but not an unsightly 
one. The word eka also means 'unique' and thus his complexion, facial, physical structures 
etc., shall be unique and shall differ from ordinary beings. kShaNe kShaNe yat navataam 
upaiti tadeva ruupam ramaNiiyataayaaH 'which / what / who gets newness moment by moment, that 
alone is pleasant...'

Shlok 4: "Who is that self-composed one, who controlled his ire, who is brilliant, non-jealous and whom do even
	the gods fear, when provoked to war... [1-1-4]

Shlok 5: "All this I wish to listen from you, oh! Great Sage, you are competent to know this kind of man, 
and indeed my inquisitiveness is immense..." Thus Valmiki enquired with Narada. [1-1-5]

[Commentary] Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki is thinking aloud, about 
the qualities of his prospective hero of this epic and these are the very opening questions put to an Omniscient 
Sage Narada. Both the sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki asks Narada, "who is that 
man with godly qualities?' If Narada tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, there is nothing left for Valmiki 
to compose his epic, because there are numerous mythologies, puraaNa-s, that have already adored God 
Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, again Valmiki need not attempt to author about 
some king, however great that king might be.

[Commentary] The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.1 
- guNavaan 2 - viryavaan 3 - dharmaj~naH 4 - kR^itaj~naH 5 - satyavaakyaH 6 - dhR^iDhavrataH 7 - caaritravaan 8 - sarvabhuuteShu hitaH 9 -
 vidvaan 10 - samarthaH - 11 - priyadarshanaH 12 - aatmavaan 13 - jitakrodhaH 14 - dyutimaan 15 - anasuuyakaH 16 - bibhyatidevaaH These sixteen attributes are attributed 
to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki is about to picture Rama to be as pleasant as a 
full-moon.

Shlok 6: On listening all those words of Valmiki, Narada, the knower of all the three worlds, said "let 
it be heard..." and beckoning at Sage Valmiki to listen attentively, he spoke these words very gladly. 
[1-1-6]

[Commentary] Narada is cognizant of three worlds, where the three worlds are bhuuloka, bhuvarloka, suvarloka 
this world, the intermediary heaven, the heavens themselves.

Shlok 7: "Oh! Sage Valmiki, the merits which you have extolled are many, and unattainable. I, after having known from Brahma of such a man with all these merits, will speak on...Let it be heard." Thus Narada started to say. [1-1-7]

[Commentary] Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him, and wanted 
him to impart these very attributes to Valmiki to compose Ramayana. It is a coincidence of interests 
Valmiki and those of Narada and Brahma.

Shlok 8: "One emerged from Ikshvaku dynasty, known to people as Rama by name. He is with a controlled self, 
highly valorous, resplendent, steadfast and a controller of (vice and vile... or) his own senses. [1-1-8]

[Commentary] For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From niyataatmaa to
vashii these are the attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. swaruupa-niruupaka- 
lakShaNaaH . This niyataatmaa is 'immutable Absolute, this is the postulate of any Upanishad:
ya aatmaa apahatapaapmaa virajo vimR^ityurvishoko... 8-7-1, ChÄndogya-UpaniShad. mahaaviiryaH = acintya
	 vividhavicitrashaktivaan Absolute is Omnicompetent paraa asya shaktiH 
vividhaa iva shruuyate svaabhaavikii j~naanabalakriyaa ca 6-8, Shwetaashvatara-UpaniShad. The 
word dyutimaan is for the attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness.
tam eva bhaantam anubhaati sarvam tasya bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati 2-11, Mundaka-UpaniShad. 
And the dhR^ithimaan is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjayanti dhR^itiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH 
and as said in aanando brahma - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante 6, Taittariiya- 
Upanishad. Next, vashii Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe. eko vahii sarva bhuutaantaraatmaa
     2-5-12, Katha-Upanishad and sarvasya vashii sarvasya iishaanaH and 
the like. The rest of the attributes of Rama as said by Narada are identifiable with the causative factors 
of that Absolute in Creation, and the process of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.

Shlok 9: "He is a wise one, moralist, eloquent, glorious, and a destroyer of enemies. His arms are lengthy, 
with three lines in the neck [indicative of good fortune], and cheekbones high... [1-1-9]

[Commentary] The Absolute is an adept one in creating the Creation yat sarvaj~naH sarvavit. He is niitimaan 
one who maintains the rhythm of universe as said at eSa setuH vidharaNa eSaam lokanaamasambhedaaya... 
He is propitious because shriiH kaantisaMpadoH lakshmyaam... gleaming, glistering richness 
of prosperity emanates from him. The following stanzas describe the physical qualities an Emperor should 
have by birth, as per saamudrikashaastra, the physiognomic treatise of astrology.

Shlok 10: "He is lion-chested, with concealed collarbones, knee-length are his arms, and his is a long bow, an enemy-subjugator, 
and his emperor's countenance is with a crowning-head and an ample forehead, and his gait is majestic like that of a lion... 
[1-1-10]

[Commentary] When his physique is extolled, suddenly a weapon is said, in saying that 'his is longbow...' this is 
called prakramabhangadoSa 'jump-cut in narration...' It is not so, his lengthy arms are said 
firstly and those arms can wield a great bow that can eliminate enemies, both physical and psychological 
ones like ariSaDvarga like desire, ire, avarice, conceit etc., as detailed in verse 
4 above.

Shlok 11: "He is built proportionately physically, with limbs poised symmetrically, sinew-chested, wide-eyed, complexioned 
charmingly... he is a prosperous one with all the auspicious features ... 
[1-1-11]

[Commentary] Up to here the godly physical aspect bhagavadvigraha is explained that which is perceptible 
by the adherents as said in ChÄndogya Upanishad: ya eSo antaraaditye hiraNmayaH puruSo dR^ishyate... 
1-6-6. From now on, the features that are reliable for the adherers are said.

Shlok 12: "He is the knower of rectitude, bidden by the truth, also his concern is in the welfare of subjects, 
proficient in prudence, clean in his conduct, self-controlled and an attentive one... 
[1-1-12]

Shlok 13: "He equals Lord Vishnu, the Lord of all creatures, Sustainer of the Universe, together with Sri Lakshmi (shriimaan = lakShmiivaan), Eliminator of enemies,
 Protector of the world of living creatures and complete Guardian of probity... 
[1-1-13]

[Commentary] The word à¤°à¤à¥à¤·à¤¿à¤¤à¤¾ is the Nominative Singular of à¤°à¤à¥à¤·à¤¿à¤¤à¥ and means Protector. Please note that prajaapatiH can be applied to Vedic Gods as well as to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Maheswara.
Here we consider Rama as equalling the Supreme God Lord Vishnu who is the One with Goddess Sri Lakshmi and also the sustainer. prajaapatiH is thus being translated as Lord Vishnu. Please note that we are
deviating from traditional translations of prajaapatiH as Lord Brahma here and this is intentional.

'These features show the aspects of Rama's incarnation...' Govindaraja. 'These features are available 
only in the Supreme Person, but unobtainable in any other...' Maheshvara Tiirtha. These two, Govindaraja 
and Maheshvara Tiirtha are reputed commentators on Ramayana among many 
others.

Shlok 14: "He is the preserver of his own righteousness and also a champion for adherent's welfare in the same 
righteousness, and he is a scholar in the essence of Veda-s and their ancillaries, too. He is an expert 
in dhanurVeda, the Art of Archery... [1-1-14]

[Commentary] These are the ancillary subjects of Vedas called anga part and upa-anga sub-part. 
The main parts of Veda-s are shikShaa ritual rigor vyaakaraNa grammar chandas 
prosody jyotishya astrology nirukta recital rules kalpa procedure rules. This 
apart, the dhanurveda science of archery, itself is treated as 'an exclusive Veda taught to 
warriors...' The dhanurveda is not to be construed as simple bow and arrow and 'shooting the 
target' education. It is a 'scripture on missiles' that existed in those ages.

[Commentary] Down the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated Weekly 
of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading Ancient India 
may have had N-arms , in the Statesman, with dateline Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, 
the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe the disaster caused by such astra-s, now 
loosely termed as a well crafted bow and sky rocketing arrows, as below:

[Commentary] 'A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire 
was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be 
perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... 
the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with 
clouds...'

[Commentary] Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of Brahmaastra, as in Mahabharata, the other 
Epic of India. Thus the Dhanurveda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, which fortunately 
has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything would have been annihilated 
by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to Mahabharata, there are elaborate accounts of such
astra-s in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, who is well-versed in warfare, gives many 
such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.

Shlok 15: "He is the knower of the meaning and essence of all the scriptures, excellent at memory, a brilliant one, 
and dear to all the worlds, gentle, level-headed and clear-headed in discriminating and distinguishing... 
[1-1-15]

Shlok 16: "Like an ocean that is reached by rivers, that reverential one too is always accessible 
and reachable by clean-minded ones, and he treats all equally, and ever a feast to eye... [1-1-16]

[Commentary] Here it is said 'he is reachable by all clean-minded ones...' satpravartana, sadbudhhi... 
and those that approach him with a sacrilegious intent, will meet their end at his hand. sarvasamaH 
means, that he does not discriminate people by their caste, creed, or by that individual's philosophy 
etc., like tribal boatman Guha, low-birthed Shabari, and nihilist Sage Jaabaali et al. jaati-guNa- 
vR^itti-aadi bhedaabhaavaat And the word eva in sa eva priyadarshanaH indicates 
'always...' 'unvarying in his demeanour with anyone...' Govindaraja. And by the simile of ocean to Rama, 
for rivers there is no other course except an ocean; thus, the living beings, may it be humans or birds 
like Jataayu, have no other recourse than Rama.

Shlok 17: "He who betters the happiness of his mother Kausalya is an embodiment of all noble merits, and in profundity 
he is like an unfathomable ocean, and by fortitude he is unalterable like the kingly Himalayan mountain... 
[1-1-17]

[Commentary] At times Rama is said to be 'the son of Kausalya...' than the son of Dasharatha, because the word Kausalya 
does not signify his mother alone, the daughter of King of Kosala, but it has meanings like kShema, 
kushala, saamarthya, puNya, nipuNatva 'safeness, soundness, capability, merit, expertise...' and 
this also signifies Queen Kausalya's worshipping of Vishnu. When dynasty, valour, braveness etc., are 
said, Rama's name will be attached with Dasharatha. An ocean is not a bottomless one but an unfathomable 
one. So also Rama's heart has a reachable bottom, where pearls, gems, and other treasures of virtues 
are abounding, and it can be reached with a heartily approach. For a hard-hearted one, Rama's heart becomes 
an unfathomable abyss and he will get lost in it. girayoH varShadhaaraabhirharyamaaNaa 
na vivyadhuH | abhibhuuyamaanaa vyasanaiH yathaa adhokShajacetasaa || 'true devotees do not 
get hassled though subjected to many problems, for they place their faith in the Supreme. Equally, mountains 
are unshaken though battered by storms or lightings...' So, like a mountain he is unalterable and constant 
for a true devotee. An icy-mountain is meltable by scorching sun, thus Rama also melts down when his 
adherents are scorched with their problems.

Shlok 18- 19a: "In valour Rama is comparable to Vishnu, and in his looks he is attractive like the moon, he equals 
the earth in his forgiveness, but he is matchable to world ending fire in his wrath... and in benevolence 
he is identical to Kubera, God of Wealth, and in his candour he is like Dharma itself, the 
Truth personified, with none to rival him... [1-1-18, 19a]

[Commentary] Here the 'valour' is to cause harm to enemy, while remaining himself unharmed... svasya avikaara 
eva parasya vikaara aapadanam Rama Tilaka. 'Though Rama is Vishnu, but by nature of his incarnation 
as human, he is different from Vishnu upaadhi-bheda... Hence Vishnu has become another entity 
than Rama... Or, his valour is selfsame to Vishnu's valour because he is selfsame Vishnu...' Govindaraja. 
'As there is none other in similitude, he is compared Vishnu, insofar as valour is concerned...' Maheshvara 
Tiirtha. Earth personally does not grieve when people tread on it, trample, dig, cut, or whatever is 
done to her. Likewise Rama personally gets unaffected, whatever harm is done to him, but he becomes 
wrathful, if that harm is committed to dharma.

[Commentary] Thitherto, the Bala Kanda is narrated by these narrations of sparkled in Ikshvaku dynasty 'Rama's 
incarnation...' highly valorous, enemy subjugator... 'elimination of demoness Tataka, subdual 
of the vanity of Parashu Rama...' propitious 'marriage with Seetha, knows Art of Archery 
'receiving missiles from Vishvamitra...' From now poet tells the Ayodhya Kanda, and a gist of this magnum 
opus is given here itself. This narration is known as baala raamayana - saMkShepa raamaayaNa 
meaning that it is aimed at youngsters as it has been told in an abridged version. In the endnote, details 
about this version and still abridged version, called Gayatri Ramayana, are given.

[Commentary] Readers may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are 'a must.' Pt. 
Satya Vrat, the author of Ramayana - A Linguistic Study says: "Ellipsis is the peculiarity 
of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense 
which has to be supplemented by adhyaahaara, viz., supply of words, that would fit in the 
context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis could be readily understood and would suggest the word 
or words that would make it up...' We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, 
than by the order of words, for there is a saying... paaThakrame arthakramo baliiyaH... So, 
this adhyaahaara, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit 
to English.

Shlok 19b- 20- 21a: "Lord of the land King Dasaratha with an intent for doing good to the people, affectionately desired to endow with regent-hood to that Rama, 
the eldest and a dear son to Dasaratha and who possessed such merits with true valour, together with best of qualities, 
and concerned for welfare of the people....[1-1-29b, 20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: "Then seeing the arrangements for the anointment of Rama as crown-prince, Kaikeyi, the dear wife 
and a queen of Dasaratha, solicited boons that were once accorded to her by Dasharatha, for the 
banishment of Rama and anointment of Bharata as boons. [1-1-21b, 22]

Shlok 23: "Bound by his true plighted word and by the noose of righteousness that king Dasharatha 
		exiled his dear son Rama to forests. [1-1-23]

Shlok 24: "That warrior Rama went to forest for pleasing Kaikeyi, and as 
directed by his father, and to follow his father's word of honour. [1-1-24]

Shlok 25- 26a: "While that Rama was going on exile, Lakshmana, endowed with humbleness, and augmentor of his mother Sumitra's joy, and a loving and a 
dear brother to Rama, followed him out of affection, showing brotherly fraternity.[1-1-25, 26a]

[Commentary] à¤µà¥à¤°à¤à¤¨à¥à¤¤à¤®à¥ is an accusative case of à¤µà¥à¤°à¤à¤¤à¥ with à¤µà¥à¤°à¤à¥ as its root.

Shlok 26b- 27- 28a: "Even Seetha, daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, and Rama's beloved wife equalling to Rama's life, ever well disposed, born in the family of Janaka and one as though 
	fashioned by a Divine marvel, endowed with all good characteristics and the best among women, followed Rama to forest, like Rohini following the Moon... [1-1-26b, 
	27, 28a]

[Commentary] Here devamaayaa refers to many concepts. VaiShNavaite tenets tell that the word
	deva is ascribable only to Vishnu, but not to other gods. Thus, this is ViShNumaayaa,
	 when He assumed an extraordinary female form called Mohini, when distributing
	amR^ita, the divine elixir, to gods and demons. Next is the form of Tilottama, a 
	divine beauty to hoodwink demons called Sunda and Upasunda. The other is Vishnu's liilaa 
	shakti, which is divinely fascinating. Yet another is grammatical connotation, maa 
	yaa where, maa= Goddess Lakshmi; yaa= who that is; meaning yaa 
	siitaa saa maa= 'who is Goddess Lakshmi... She is Seetha...' and this results in the 
	saying: ati ruupavatii siitaa... ati muurkhaH cha raavaNa 'While Seetha is extraordinarily 
	beautiful, Ravana is exceedingly stupid...

[Commentary] The deities have their wives always with them. Chandra, the Moon has Rohini, a conspicuous star, while 
Surya, Sun has Prabha, Sunshine. Minus these wives, their glow and glitter is void. So also, Rama has 
an inseparable wife. Though Seetha and Lakshmana were not exiled, they followed Rama out of concept 
of 'togetherness...'

Shlok 28b- 29- 30a: "The citizens of Ayodhya and his father Dasaratha followed virtuous Rama for a 
distance when he started on his exile. Later Rama reached the tribal chief named Guha, who liked 
Rama, on the bank of River Ganga in a town called Sringaberapura. Together with Guha, 
Lakshmana and Seetha, he left off the charioteer. [1-1-28b, 29, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31- 32a: "That trio of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana after going from forest to forest and crossing many a river with much waters, 
by the ordainment of Bharadwaja, arrived at Chitrakuta, and building a handsome cottage there, they lived happily and delightfully 
in the woods there, like gods and gandharvas... [1-1-30b, 31, 32a]

[Commentary] In another way the meaning is: te avane 'they, protecting each other...' te ramamaaNaaH 
' those two Rama and Seetha, frolicsomely delighted, enjoyed the essence of forest dwelling...' saMkaashaa 
similar to Vishnu or Narayana's enjoyment of kriiDaa rasa 'the essence of His playful acts...' 
and Lakshmana enjoyed the essence of his servitude sevaa rasa and where deva = devii ca 
devaH ca devau 'either goddess or god... it but the Almighty...' gandharva = gaanam dhaarayati 
iti gandharva - jiivan muktaH attaining liberation while living, thus Lakshmana rejoiced with his singing of saama 
gaana of Sama Veda....' And they rejoiced without feeling any difference between city dwelling 
and forest dwelling... as every part of Universe is theirs.

[Commentary] In another way tevane vanam gatvaa 'playfully, to forests, they went...' It is a play for them 
to enter the forest to resolve the purpose of Ramayana and their incarnations.

Shlok 32b- 33a: "On Rama going to Chitrakuta thus, King Dasharatha tormented by the grief for son, went to heavens 
weeping for son... [1-1-32b, 33a]

[Commentary] The word 'thus' in the shloka, is according to the text of Govindaraja. Maheshvara Tiirtha's text will have 'then'.

Shlok 33b- 34: "On Dasharatha's dying, though Bharata had been appointed for kingship by Sage Vashishta and other Brahmanas, that highly mighty one did not desire kingdom.
	That warrior Bharata went to forest to propitiate the venerable Rama... [1-1-33b. 34]

Shlok 35- 36a: "That Bharata, possessed of a worthy way of thinking [to get Rama installed as king], on going to Rama, begged his brother Rama, a great souled one and a 
	truly courageous one. Bharata spoke words in this manner to Rama - "You alone, the knower of probity, be the king." ... ' [1-1-35, 36a]

[Commentary] tu is omitted in the translation since it is there for the purpose of paadapuuraNa.

Shlok 36b- 37a: "Even though Rama was very benevolent, gracious also, highly famed and with great prowess, Rama did not desire kingdom due to father's injunction... [1-1-36b, 37a]

Shlok 37b- 38a: "Thereafter, repeatedly turning Bharata back, the elder brother, Rama, gave his wooden shoes to Bharata and entrusting them to represent him 
for the sake of kingdom. [1-1-37b, 38a]

Shlok 38b- 39a: "That Bharata, thus with a desire unfulfilled, ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, touching Rama's sandals representing feet of Rama, with an
expectation of Rama's arrival... [1-1-38b, 39a]

Shlok 39b- 40: "On the departure of Bharata, that splendid Rama, truth-bound, and self-controlled, anticipated the repeated 
visits of citizens and other people. To be undisturbed, Rama then entered Dandaka forests... [1-1-39b, 40]

[Commentary] The translation of ekaagraH as "undisturbed" is done according to the context of Rama's anticipation that there might be repeated visits
from various people to Chitrakuta and entreaties from them for Rama to return to Ayodhya. Normally ekaagraH is translated as 
"single-pointed attention". Govindaraja explains ekaagraH with respect to following father's injunction or being alert to increased 
presence of RakShasaas.

Shlok 41- 42a: "That lotus-eyed Rama, on his entering the vast Dandaka forest, killed the demon Viraadha, and 
indeed beheld Sage Sharabhanga and also Sage Suteekhsna, Sage Agastya and likewise Sage Agastya's 
brother... [1-1-41, 42a]

[Commentary] The name of Agastya's brother is Sudarshana, and he will never be called by his own name, but will be 
called as agatsyabhraataa, brother of Agastya.

[Commentary] tu is omitted in the translation since it is there for the purpose of paadapuuraNa.

Shlok 42b- 43a: "On Sage Agastya's word, Rama, with great delight, received from Agastya, Indra's bow along with the sword and two quivers with ever replenishing
 arrows... [1-1-42b, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: "During Rama's stay in the forest, all the sages together with other forest dwellers,
approached him for the elimination of ogres and demons... [1-1-43b, 44a]

Shlok 44b- 45: "He [Rama] agreed to that supplication of those sages dwelling in the forest of demons. A promise was also made by Rama to the sages who equalled 
the fire and who were living in that Dandaka forest about killing of the demons in combat... [1-1-44b, 45]

[Commentary] The word asura is as from asuun raati iti asura: asu = life; ra= taker; i.e., 
life takers - demons, while the word sura is nectar consuming one, the divine. In later chapters 
of this canto, accounts are given as how these were created and named.

Shlok 46: "While Rama was living there in the Dandaka forest, a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpa-nakha, who was 
a resident of Janasthana, a portion of Dandaka forest, was disfigured by him... [1-1-46]

[Commentary] Readers are referred to the verse 3-18-20 where Rama asks 
Lakshmana to deface Shuurpa-nakha who carries out the act of cutting the 
nose and ears of this demoness, which is the turning point of the story. From this verse it is clear that Rama is instrumental in the disfiguring
of Shuurpa-nakha.

[Commentary] Shuurpa-nakha is so named because her fingernails are like winnowing fans, shuurpatulyanakhaa iti shuurpanakhaa; shuurpa= 
	winnowing fan; tulya = like; nakhaa = fingernails. She is the sister of Ravana the main antogonist of the epic, and 
	she is the actual trouble creator in the epic.

Shlok 47- 48a: "Then in a battle, Rama killed all demons who became zealously active incited by Suurphanakha's words, 
including the demons Khara, Trishira, Duushana together with all of their foot-followers... [1-1-47, 48a]

[Commentary] We are ignoring in translation the à¤à¤µ part of à¤à¥à¤µ and translating the word à¤à¥à¤µ as "and".

Shlok 48b- 49a: "During Rama's stay in that forest, fourteen thousand demon inhabitants of Janasthana became slain... [1-1-48b, 49a]

Shlok 49b- 50a: "Then, on hearing the slaughter of his kinsmen, Ravana convulsed in anger and sought to get the help of a 
		demon named Maareecha... [1-1-49b, 50a]

[Commentary] Ravana is the supremo of demons and the main antagonist in this epic. His name is Dashagriiva, meaning 
that he has ten heads. This name 'Ravana' obtains from the root ru - shabde raavayati iti raavaNaH 'one who makes 
people cry by his violent actions...' and it also means vishravasaH apatyam pumaan raavaNaH, 
vishravaso vishravaNa-ravaNau 'the son of one named Vishravasa...' Govindaraja.

[Commentary] à¤µà¤°à¤¯à¤¾à¤®à¤¾à¤¸ is the à¤²à¤¿à¤à¥ à¤²à¤à¤¾à¤° of  of the root à¤µà¤° (see à¤à¤¤à¥à¤®à¤¨à¥à¤ªà¤¦à¥ form)

Shlok 50b- 51a: "But Maareecha restrained Ravana telling him many times, 'Oh, Ravana! Rivarly with that formidable 
Rama is not appropriate of you...' [1-1-50b, 51a]

Shlok 51b- 52a: "Then disregarding Maareecha's words and impelled by his own fate, Ravana advanced to the 
place of Rama's hermitage along with Maareecha... [1-1-51b, 52a]

Shlok 52b- 53a: "After taking away of Rama and Lakshmana to a distance by the trickster Maareecha, Ravana stole Rama's wife after killing Jatayu... [1-1-52b, 53a]

Shlok 53b- 54a: "Raghava on seeing the smitten Jatayu and also on hearing about Seetha's abduction, wailed with disturbed senses, 
seething with anguish  ... [1-1-53b, 54a]

Shlok 54b- 55: "Rama then cremated that vulture Jataayu with that state of anguish, and while searching for Seetha in forest, he 
indeed saw a demon named Kabandha, deformed in his looks and with a terrible appearance... [1-1-54b, 
55]

Shlok 56- 57a: "That Rama with great arms after slaying Kabandha, cremated him and Kabandha obtanined heaven. Before going to heaven, he spoke thus to Rama:
'Oh Raghava! You proceed to Sabari, a lady with righteous conduct, an expert in probity and a devotee.'... [1-1-56, 57a]

Shlok 57b- 58a: "That great resplendent Rama, the son of Dasaratha, an anhillator of enemies, approached Sabari and was thoroughly honoured by her... [1-1-57b, 58a]

[Commentary] Next verse onwards the episodes in KiShkindha are introduced. Now Rama meets Hanuma, the Vaanara.  vanena= in forests, charati= moves about,
iti= thus; therefore vaanara = 'forest-ranger' is the declination of the term Vaanara.  
Traditionally Hanuma is worshipped as a god.

Shlok 58b- 59a: "Rama was united indeed with the Vanara Hanuma on the banks of Lake Pampa, and upon the word of Hanuma, Rama met with 
	Sugreeva... [1-1-58b, 59b]

Shlok 59b- 60a: "The highly powerful Rama detailed from the beginning all that happened, and in particular the abduction of Seetha, to Sugriva 
and to Hanuma also... [1-1-59b, 60a]

[Commentary] Here the use of 'highly powerful...' for Rama is to indicate that though he himself was capable enough 
to eliminate Ravana, but as a human, he needed some agency, since humans in such difficulties 
are usually in need of a helping hand. As such, Rama had to befriend Sugreeva and 
it was necessary to narrate all sad episodes to his friend.

Shlok 60b- 61a: "The Vanara Sugreeva after listening to all that talk of Rama made friendship with Rama delightedly with sacred fire as witness... [1-1-60b, 61a]

Shlok 61b- 62a: "Then out of affection, the incident was related with regard to Sugreeva's enemity with Vali  
in its entirety by the Vanara King with grief to Rama ... [1-1-61b, 62a]

Shlok 62b- 63a: "Then a solemn promise was made by Rama with regards to killing of Vali. In that regard Vanara Sugreeva also described Vali's strength... [1-1-62b, 63a]

[Commentary] Vali, the elder brother of Sugreeva, is another principle character of Ramayana. He is capable of rendering 
oblations to gods in the wee hours of a single day in four oceans on four sides of the globe, by his 
flying from one ocean to the other. He is mightier than Ravana, the chief villain of the epic, and 
Ravana was subdued by Vali's strength. As a preamble to the incident of eliminating mighty Ravana in 
the last book of the epic, this episode of eliminating a still mightier monkey is the stepping-stone 
for the climactic victory.

Shlok 63b- 64: "But Sugreeva remained ever doubtful with respect to Raghava, about Raghava's prowess. Sugreeva showed Dundubhi's big and great mountain-like
dead body to gain confidence in Raghava... [1-1-63b, 64]

[Commentary] Vali had at one time killed Dundubhi and kicked his body over a long distance.

Shlok 65: Great armed and very powerful Rama after seeing the bones of Dundubhi smiled and by the big toe of his foot threw it wholly for ten 
yojana-s length. [1-1-65]

[Commentary] Vali was able to throw that body, with whole of his foot, only up to two hundred bow-lengths, where the 
length of bow is said as six to seven feet. But Rama could kick that heap to ten yojana lengths, roughly 
ninety miles, only with a flip of his foot-toe's tip. But Sugreeva continued his grumbling, 'in those 
days this skeleton was with flesh and blood, now it became weight-less, thus show me more of your show 
of strength...' One Yojana is an ancient measure for distance, where that distance is covered in one 
yoking. Chambers dictionary puts it as five miles, and it is not agreeable for it was British-Indian revenue 
measure. Traditionally it is four krosha-s and thus each yojana is nine to ten miles.

[Commentary] Govindaraja cleaves the compound utsmayitvaa to ut smayitvaa and takes ut 
'to up...' and fixes it to cikShepa to mean ut cikShepa 'up-heaved and hurled...' 
and smayitva comes to mean 'smiling self-assuredly, or smiling self-composedly...' And Maheshvara 
Tiirtha says that 'when all-wise-knowers are not able to know what I am, there is no surprise if a monkey 
in a remote forest doubts my capability... let him see a speck of it...' thus Rama smiled in aplomb...'

[Commentary] And the often repeated epithet to Rama mahaabaahuH means not just 'yards and yards of lengthy 
arms...dangling up to knees..' but 'one who does unimaginable deeds...' and his arms are the unusual 
instruments to perform such unusual tasks, hence ambidextrous, or omni-dextrous...

Shlok 66: "Then again Rama ripped through seven massive Sala trees with only one great arrow, which not only went through 
the trees but also rent through a mountain, and to the nethermost subterranean of earth, in order to 
create faith in the mind of Sugreeva... [1-1-66]

[Commentary] The rasaatala is deepest subterranean plane, and it forms the base of other planes of earth 
called, atala, vitala, sutala, talaatala, mahaatala, rasaatala underneath the surface of earth 
up to its core.

Shlok 67: "Thereafter great monkey Sugreeva with a gladdened heart by that act of Rama, proceeded to cave-like Kishkindha then along with Rama 
and with confidence in Rama's strength... 
[1-1-67]

Shlok 68: "Then that best monkey Sugreeva, with a golden hue, made a roaring sound. By that loud sound, the king of monkeys, Vali, emerged out... 
[1-1-68]

Shlok 69: "Then after Tara [wife of Vali] permitting, Vali met with Sugreeva in a combat. And Rama killed this Vali with a single arrow there... [1-1-69]

Shlok 70: "Then Raghava after killing Vali in a combat as per Sugreeva's plea, installed Sugreeva alone as the king of Vanaras.. [1-1-70]

Shlok 71: "That best among monkeys, Sugreeva, after summoning all Vanaras, dispatched them in different directions to behold the daughter of Janaka... [1-1-71]

[Commentary] Sugreeva was acclaimed to be a strict disciplinarian, and his orders were inviolable by anyone. Even now the 
proverbial saying exists that a "command by elders is to be followed like sugreevaaj~naa 'Sugreeva's 
order'.

Shlok 72: "After that, the strong Hanuma, upon the word of the vulture Sampati who was elder brother of Jatayu, flew across the salty ocean
 one hundred yojanas in breadth... [1-1-72]

Shlok 73: "On reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, Hanuma saw Seetha situated in Ashoka gardens there and meditating on Rama alone... [1-1-73]

Shlok 74: "After delivering to Seetha the mark of identification in the form of a ring from Rama and also communicating
 Rama's disposition and consoling Vaidehi, Hanuma destroyed the welcome-arch of Ashoka gardens... [1-1-74]

Shlok 75: "After killing five army chiefs and seven minister's sons and crushing the valiant Aksha, Hanuma got into state of captivity... [1-1-75]

Shlok 76-77: "Knowing himself to be free from the captivity of the weapon according to Brahma's boon, the valiant great monkey Hanuma
enduring those demons with self-will who tied his tail with ropes with the intention of burning it, there after burning the city of Lanka while 
 leaving from fire the Seetha of Mithila, got back again to convey the pleasant news to Rama ... [1-1-76, 77]

[Commentary] This is in sundara kaanDa. Hanuma sees Ravana and others in the court, and as a show 
of his strength burns down Lanka  except the place where Seetha is stationed, only to prove that the riches and wealth enjoyed at the cost others will burn 
down to ashes some day, 
besides Vibheeshana's place, for Vibheeshana is the adherer of Dharma. This episode is to relegate 
the false pride of Ravana, and as a symbolic suggestion that pomp and effluence without virtue are short 
lived.

Shlok 78: "Approaching the great Rama and peforming circumambulation around Rama, Hanuma having an inestimable intelligence,
submitted in essence thus: 'Seen Seetha...' [1-1-78]

Shlok 79: "There-after, Rama along with Sugreeva and other monkeys went to the shore of Great Ocean, and put the Ocean-god to turmoil with his arrows 
comparable to the Sun... [1-1-79]

[Commentary] Rama became angry at the ocean for not yielding way to Lanka. In order to make way through the Ocean, 
Rama starts depleting its waters with arrows.

Shlok 80: "The Ocean-god revealed himself and upon his word, Nala built the bridge across the ocean... [1-1-80]

[Commentary] Nala, a Vanara engineer, had a boon from his mother. In his childhood he used to throw playthings into 
water wanting them to float. But they were all submerged. His mother then gave a boon to him saying 
that whatever article he throws in waters will float, may they be toys or stones or boulders. Here 
that boon is taken advantage of, and a boulder bridge is built on ocean waters.

Shlok 81: "Rama, having gone to the city of Lanka by that bridge, killing Ravana in a battle, experienced great shame on getting Seetha back... [1-1-81]

Shlok 82: "There-after, Rama spoke harshly to Seetha in the assembly of the people. Being devoted to her husband, that Seetha, intolerant of the
 harsh words of Rama, entered into burning fire... [1-1-82]

Shlok 83: "Then, upon the word of Fire-god, having known Seetha to be sinless, Rama became extremely glad.
Worshipped by all gods he became resplendent. By that accomplishment of the great Raghava the three worlds together with mobile and immobile
beings, and with groups of gods and sages became exultant... [1-1-83, 84]

Shlok 85: "Enthroning Vibheeshana as the chieftain of demons in Lanka, and with a done deed, 
Rama then rejoiced highly indeed free from distress... [1-1-85]

Shlok 86: "After obtaining a boon from the gods, Rama  raised up monkeys from death. He then travelled to Ayodhya by Pushpaka aircraft
surrounded by good hearted ones... 
[1-1-86]

Shlok 87: "Rama, with true valour, on going to sage Bharadwaja's hermitage, sent Hanuma to the presence of Bharata... [1-1-87]

Shlok 88: "Then, having boarded Pushpaka aircraft again after leaving the hermitage of Bharadwaja, and narrating past history
 to Sugreeva and others about the events in the days of his exile in forests, while flying overhead 
of the very same places, Rama went to Nandigrama... [1-1-88]

Shlok 89: "That sinless Rama rejoining with all of his brothers in the village Nandigrama removed his matted hair. 
Thus he, on regaining Seetha and on discarding hermit's role again became 
a householder, and he regained his kingdom also... [1-1-89]

Shlok 90: "When Rama is ruling the world will be highly rejoiced and happy, satisfied and abundant, 
also very righteous, wholesome, disease-free, and free from fear of famine..." Thus Narada is 
foreseeing the future and telling Valmiki. [1-1-90]

Shlok 91: "While Rama is on the throne men will not see the deaths of their children anywhere in their lifetime, 
and the ladies will remain husband-devouted and unwidowed during their lifetime... [1-1-91]

Shlok 92- 93a: "In the kingdom of Rama, there will be no fear for his subjects from wildfires, gale-storms or from diseases, 
and there will be no fear from hunger or thieves, nor the cattle will be drowned in floodwaters as well... [1-1-92, 
93a]

Shlok 93b- 94a: "Cities and states as well will be replete with wealth and grains likewise. All his subjects will be highly glad always,
like in Krita yuga... [1-1-93b, 94a]

Shlok 94b- 95a: "Like-wise the highly illustrious Rama having performed hundreds of horse rituals and having donated plentiful gold and crores
of cows and wealth that cannot be counted to Brahmanas and to scholars according to custom... [1-1-94b, 95a]

Shlok 96: "In this world Raghava will establish kingly dynasties in hundredfold and he will be maintaining the 
four-caste system positing each in his own duty, may it be caste-bound or provincial-kingdom-bound 
duty, in order to achieve a perfect social harmony... [1-1-96]

Shlok 97: "Having served the kingdom for ten thousand years and another one thousand years, i.e. for a total 
of eleven thousand years, Rama will go to the abode of Brahma... [1-1-97]

[Commentary] In raamaraajyam upaasitvaa... the word used is upaasana is not ruling by sceptre but 
it is 'reverentially serving the kingdom...' as one would regard or treat his personal god with reverence. 
Rama thus served his kingdom as a devotee of his subjects and this is the concept of raamaraajya. 
The brahma loka is not the abode of four-faced Brahma, but still higher abode, rather VaikunTha itself.

Shlok 98: "This Ramayana is holy, sin-eradicating, merit-endowing, and conformable with the teachings of Vedas.
Whoever reads this Legend of Rama, will be verily liberated of all sins... [1-1-98]

Shlok 99: "This Ramayana is long-life giving. A narrative by reading which a human will be blessed with sons and grandsons, and after enjoying worldly
comforts with attendants, will be adored in heaven after demise... 
[1-1-99]

Shlok 100: "By reading this Ramayana, that person if a Brahmana obtains excellency in speech, if a Kshatriya obtains land-lordship, if Vaisya
attains profit in trade and even if a Sudra attains excellence." Thus Sage Narada gave a gist of Ramayana 
to Sage-poet Valmiki. [1-1-100]



In the first chapter of Bala Kanda the gist of Ramayana is imbibed and it is called saMkShepa raamaayaNa, 
or also called baala raamaayaNa . The youngsters are asked to recite these stanzas daily for 
longevity and a perfect personality like that of Rama. The summarised stanzas reflected here are from 
the main epic. The canto-wise summarisation is as below:



Valmiki composed Ramayana according to the letters of Gayatri Hymn and they are identified with the 
following verses in all cantos:



SARGA 2
------------------------------



Sage Valmiki goes to river Tamasa for a bath and sees a couple of birds, of which a hunter 
kills one. Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, 
of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, 
the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic 
of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him.

Shlok 1: Then, the great sage Valmiki, a skilled orator and a virtue-minded one, having heard those words of Narada, 
		worshipped him along with disciples. [1-2-1]

Shlok 2: That divine sage Narada being worshipped befittingly by Valmiki in that way, on seeking 
permission of Valmiki to leave and having been permitted by Valmiki, went away heaven-ward. 
[1-2-2]

Shlok 3: Then, on Narada's going to the world of gods in a trice, that sage Valmiki went to the banks of Tamasa river not far from Jahnavi river. [1-2-3]

Shlok 4: Then that sage Valmiki on reaching the shore of the clean Tamasa, and on beholding a ford of that river, spoke to his disciple who was at his side. [1-2-4]

Shlok 5: "Oh! Bharadwaja, behold this ford which is without dirt, with clear waters and pleasant like a virtuous man's mind. [1-2-5]

Shlok 6: "My dear! Let the hand-vessel [kamaNDalu] be kept [there]. Let my bark-garment be given to me. I will enter this best 
ford of Tamasa only... [1-2-6]

Shlok 7: Thus being said by the great-souled Valmiki, Bharadwaaja who was obedient to his Guru, gave the bark-garment to the sage [1-2-7]

Shlok 8: That self-controlled Sage Valmiki on taking bark-garment from his disciple's hands, and looking in all directions, indeed moved away from that
wide expanse of forest. [1-2-8]

Shlok 9: There holy sage Valmiki saw a couple of curlews, in the vicinity of that river's 
foreshore, flying there about in togetherness and cooing charmingly. [1-2-9]

Shlok 10: A tribal hunter with evil intent, and a receptacle of enimity, killed the male 
one among the couple of birds, while Valmiki was looking on. [1-2-10]

Shlok 11-12: The wife was moving together with husband with a red crest and with joy, with good wings, always being united with that male bird. On seeing
that bird slain on ground reeling with blood covered wings really made wailing sounds with piteous utterances on being separated from her 
husband. 
[1-2-11, 12]

Shlok 13: On seeing that bird felled that way by the tribal hunter, compassion occassioned in that 
saintly sage Valmiki. [1-2-13]

Shlok 14: Then on seeing the wailing female krounchi bird, out of state of compassion and apperceiving 
the killing of male bird as unjust, the sage uttered this sentence... [1-2-14]

Shlok 15: "Oh! violent Hunter, by which reason you have killed one bird of the couple, when it 
was infatuated by passion, for that reason you will never get a state of rest for everlasting years to come..." 
[1-2-15]

[Commentary] à¤¤à¥à¤µà¤®à¤à¤®à¤ has been split as tvam+agamaH.

[Commentary] 'For endless years to come, O Hunter, never 
shall thy soul find peace /' Romesh C. Dutt.

[Commentary] This verse has many comports of which a few are given hereunder:

[Commentary] This verse is taken as ma~NgalaacaraNa to Ramayana, 
for any epic has to have ma~Ngalaaadiini; ma~Ngalamadhyaani; ma~Ngalaantaani   
A good pious beginning, pious middle and pious ending.

[Commentary] Because this verse has the letter
maa at its start and maa is lakShmii vaacaka 
in Sanskrit. It is aadivarNaH The first letter  lokamaataa maa 
ramaa ma~Ngaladevataa thus amarakosha says for Goddess Lakshmi.

[Commentary] maa= Goddess Lakshmi; niShaada= Oh! Vishnu [ for Goddess 
Lakshmi resides in the heart of Vishnu - niShadiiti asmin iti niShaada
]; yat = by which act; krouncamithunaat = the couple of 
demons, namely Ravana and Mandodari; kaamamohitam= that impassioned one and stole 
Seetha; ekam= that one, Ravana; avadhiiH= you killed; by that act of yours; 
shaashvatiissamaa= everlasting for ages; pratiShTaam= divine sanctity; 
tvam agamaH= you, get.

[Commentary] "Oh, the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, namely oh, Vishnu, by which act of your killing one male demon named 
Ravana, who in his passion abducted Seetha, and thus you eradicated the vice from the earth, 
for that you get an everlasting divine sanctity, as Rama, for ages to come."

[Commentary] 2] Next niSaada is attributable to Ravana, because he is the one who tortures others for 
his benefit. itaraam saadayati piiDayati iti niSaada thus: Oh! Ravana; krounchamithunaat= from the couple, 
say Rama and Seetha, who are flying from forest to forest like nest-less birds; 
ekam= one is, Seetha is; avadhiiH =you almost killed her by your torture of abducting 
her;
pratiSTaam= your glory in Lanka, at its zenith, as per the kindness of Brahma; maa agamaH= 
never get, hereafter. But this declination is not held right, for it is like a curse, shaapa, 
and no epic starts with a curse.

[Commentary] 3] Next, this verse is said holding Rama in the perspective. Sage Narada gave the details of the 
legend to Sage Valmiki because Brahma ordered that the legend of Rama is to be recorded. But 
Ramayana is full of pathos, karuNa-shoka-rasa-pradhaana. If it is to be penned the writer 
too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks, Rama, say 
Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like kiraataarjuniiya 
etc., to test the capability of Valmiki in narrating pathos, and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted 
immediately and Vishnu's test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Vishnu / Rama 
gets a curse like separation from wife, as below.

[Commentary] niShaada= oh tribal: Rama to Valmiki / Vishnu to mythology; for your killing one bird of 
the couple, to the misery of the female one; shaashvatiiH = as long as you live on this 
earth;
samaaH pratiSTaam= togetherness, with your wife; maa agama= do not get.

[Commentary] Oh! Rama, as long as you are on earth, you do not get the love of being together with your wife, 
because you killed one from the bird couple... and you have to live with your wife departed [to 
Lanka,] come again, and then departed [to forests.]

[Commentary] But this is differed statement, since Vishnu does not require any personal testing of the 
capabilities of the writer of Ramayana. Brahma will look after such literary things.

[Commentary] 4] The generally accepted meaning of this verse is this. Any epic's gist is to be said at the start 
or, at its commencement 
--- kaavyaarthasuucanam  
aadaaveva niruupyate--- 
 Thus, the above verse included the meaning of whole of the epic, 
Ramayana.

[Commentary] i] maa niSaada= Goddess Lakshmi and Vishnu. Their marriage in their incarnations as Rama 
and Seetha, and Ramayana depicts this in Bala Kanda.

[Commentary] ii] pratiSTaam tvam agamaH= renown, you get, by following your father's orders you have 
repaired to forests, without any political upheaval, thus get an everlasting renown as an obliging 
son Ayodhyaa Kanda.

[Commentary] iii] shaashavatiissamaa= by dwelling in forest and eradicating demons and helping the saints 
and sages thus, you achieve an everlasting praise Aranaya Kanda.

[Commentary] iv] krounchayoH= from the [atrocious] couple;
k-- krunca 
gati kauTilya alpiibhaavayoH; the 
atrocious Vali, and Tara couple; ekam kaamamohitam = passion filled one, i.e., Vali; 
avadhiiH= you killed, you killed Vali KiShkindhaa Kanda.

[Commentary] v] krounchamithunaat= from the couple of lovely passionate birds here Rama and Seetha; 
niSaada that ruffian Ravana, kaamamohitam lustfully, ekam one [i.e., 
Seetha];
avadhiiH = almost killed, i.e., her residing in Lanka is as good as death Sundara Kanda.

[Commentary] vi] krounchamithunaat = from the atrocious, couple Ravana and Mandodari; ekam avadhiiH
you killed one [Ravana] Yuddha Kanda.

[Commentary] vii] kaamamohitam= fascinated by desire, [ kaama also means a longing, desire, let 
alone lusting]; Seetha is fascinated by her desire to see sage's wives in uttara Ramayana and thus 
she is sent to forests through Lakshmana. Hence seventh canto, uttara Ramayana is also 
suggested.

Shlok 16: Thus speaking and pondering in his heart, he became thoughtful: "What is this utterance by me in grief and anguish for this bird?". [1-2-16]

Shlok 17: That great wise one who was an intellectual and the best among sages, on cogitating, made up his mind and also spoke these words to the 
disciple... [1-2-17]

Shlok 18: "While I was tormented by grief, there arose a sentence consisting of four verses possessing metrically posited letters
suitable to be played as song and string music and that will be called Shloka, not otherwise..." [1-2-18]

[Commentary] This verse he uttered is in four quarters, each quarter with equally posited eight syllables. This 
is called anuSTup metre in Sanskrit poetry. The eight syllables are,
-- maa ni  Shaa da  pra  ti  ShTaa~N  tvam | a  ga maH  shaa  shva  tiiH  sa  maaH  
--  Each quarter is paada in Sanskrit, pede in Latin; with two 
quarters in first stanza, and two stanzas one verse. This apart there are other rules like caesura 
yati
; alliteration praasa ; and other compositional rules. It has come out of shoka
sorrow, so the format is named as shloka. And, shloka also means yashas, 
kiirti
renown.

Shlok 19: Even the disciple happily received what that is articulated by the saint, a unique articulation, 
by which the saint too, was delighted. [1-2-19]

Shlok 20: Then that saint on performing his bathing in that ford according to custom, and still thinking 
on the purport of his utterance, he returned towards his hermitage. [1-2-20]

[Commentary] This is mid day bath for these hermits. tato 
madhyaahnasnaanaartham mR^idam aaharet | - - prekShya sa omkaaram aadityam triH nimajje jalaashaye 
- - vyaasa smR^iti  The word abhiSheka refers to 
ceremonial showering of waters on deities or on kings in his coronation. At the beginning Valmiki 
arrives at the river for a daily bath, which he would do by usual dipping in river waters. But here 
it appears that waters are showered on him, abhiShekam kR^itvaa meaning that waters showered 
on him are on the analogy of poetic verses of Ramayana.

Shlok 21: Then Bharadwaja, the obedient disciple and an erudite scholar, for he heard and learnt many 
scriptures by listening, on taking handy-vessel full with water followed at the behind of 
his mentor. [1-2-21]

Shlok 22: He that knower of dharma, Valmiki, having entered the threshold of hermitage along with disciples, 
and having seated spoke about the day-to-day teachings and also other things, but he himself 
is preoccupied in cogitation on the verse. [1-2-22]

Shlok 23: Then, the great resplendent Four-faced creator of fourteen worlds, almighty Brahma, arrived 
there on his own, to see that eminent saint Valmiki. [1-2-23]

[Commentary] Comment; The deities do not usually arrive on their own, but reveal themselves after a great 
penance, or on raising hue and cry as is done by demon devotees. Here Brahma, one among the 
Trinity of Hindu mythology, arrives on his own, to execute a divine deed through Valmiki, 
i.e. authoring the epic, Ramayana.

Shlok 24: Then that pious saint Valmiki is highly surprised on seeing Brahma, and on quickly getting 
up from his seat with his palms adjoined humbly, he stood aside, as he is spellbind. [1-2-24]

Shlok 25: Valmiki uninterruptedly venerated Brahma, on inquiring into his well-being, washed his feet, drenched his 
thirst, seated him to rest, and adored at best with customarily obeisance. [1-2-25]

[Commentary] Comment: Brahma is one in the Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Brahma is pictured to 
have four faces, each representing one Veda, where Vedas are four in number. He is the creator 
of worlds, while Vishnu maintains them, and Shiva dissolute them. The concert of Brahma is 
Saraswati, the presiding deity of speech, who was earlier requested by Brahma to be on the 
tongue of Valmiki to utter the poem, [as at 1-2-15] as an intuition to Valmiki. Thus Brahma 
now arrives to ordain Valmiki to author Ramayana.

Shlok 26: Then god Brahma, who is seated on a high seat, very highly worshipped by Valmiki, also beckoned 
at Valmiki to take a seat. [1-2-26]

Shlok 27-28a: Even though Valmiki sat on his seat when duly permitted by Brahma, and though the Grandparent 
of the worlds is manifestly sitting before him, but the same broodings on those happenings 
occurred on that day have recurred on his mind. [1-2-27-28a]

Shlok 28b-29a: "He that tribal hunter, who killed a cutely calling krouncha bird for no good reason than intending 
to capture the kill, is an evil souled one that caused hardship..." [1-2-28b-29a]

Shlok 29b-30a: Remaining in melancholic mood Valmiki turned his mind to the depth of thinking, and again 
thinking only on the krouncha bird he sung the same verse, involuntarily. [1-2-29b-30a]

[Commentary] The word jaguH is singing; gai= shabde; liT; prathama bahu; jagau - jagatuH - jaguH; 
variant of gaay; c.f. Raghuvamsha of Kalidasa, verse 20, in fourth sarga; 
aakumaarakathodghaatam shaaligopyo
jaguryashaH

Shlok 30b-31a: Then, Brahma smilingly spoke to that eminent saint Valmiki, "But, what that is composed is 
a verse only... and there is no need to think through... [1-2-30]

Shlok 31b-32a: "Oh, Brahman, that speech of yours sprang forth at my wish alone, hence oh, eminent sage, 
you shall render the legend of Rama, in its entirety... [1-2-31]

Shlok 32b-33a: "You shall narrate the legend of Rama, the virtuous, intellectual and an intrepid one, and 
a godlike person in this world as well, as you have heard it from sage Narada. [1-2-32]

Shlok 33b-35a: "The adventures of valorous Rama along with Lakshmana, and the misadventures of demons, known 
or unknown in every detail, and even the plight of Vaidehi which is either revealed or un-revealed 
so far, and whatever legend that has happened, all that will also be known to you, even if 
it were to be unknown, as yet... [1-2-33-34]

Shlok 35b-36a: "You shall versify the heart pleasing and merit-yielding legend of Rama, and not a single 
word of yours will not be false in this epic... [1-2-35]

Shlok 36b-37a: "As long as the mountains and even rivers flourish on the surface of the earth, so long the 
legend of Ramayana will flourish in this world... [1-2-36]

Shlok 37b-38a: "And as long as Rama's legend authored by you flourishes...till then you will flourish in 
heavenly, in netherworlds, and even in my abode, namely Abode of Brahma... [1-2-37]

Shlok 38b: On saying thus that Divinity Brahma vanished then and there only, and then that godly sage 
Valmiki came by astonishment, along with his disciples. [1-2-38]

Shlok 39: Then all of the disciples of Valmiki sang this verse time and again very delightedly, and 
much astonished they also recited this verse, reciprocally. [1-2-39]

Shlok 40: Equally lettered, four-footed is that verse when great Sage Valmiki articulated it, and when 
repetitively recited by one and all, it attained prominence as verse proper. [1-2-40]

[Commentary] Comment: A poet never says poetry to satisfy his own instincts, but to imbue an involuntary 
imagination or passion in others when read or heard by the so called others. It is the empathy 
of that poetry. For Kalidasa it is shR^ingaara, passion, for Bhavabhuti it is pity 
'eko rasaH karuNaH...' for Valmiki it is pathos, shoka. For this Kavi Kalidas says:
niShaadaviddhaaNDajadarshanotthaH shlokatvamaapadyata yasya shokaH -- raghu va~Nsha 
14-70 There are two texts for this one is, shlokaH shlokatvam aagataH... meaning 
that the verse originally structured metrically can now can be sung. Second is shokaH 
shlokatvam aagataH... the pathos of the poet attained the status of verse that is now 
being sung by the disciples, thus anyone can recite it.

Shlok 41: Born is an intuition in that great sage and contemplated soul asserting that "I will compose 
entire Ramayana, the epic, in suchlike verses...' [1-2-41]

Shlok 42: That celebrated sage and magnanimous seer Valmiki then authored the highly renowned Rama's 
legend extolling Rama's renown, with symmetrically worded verses, and words versified to yield 
meanings semantically, prosody free-flowing, and with hundreds of such verses. [1-2-42]

Shlok 43: That epic contains uncomplicated compounds, conjunctions and conjugations, and has expressive 
sentences that are well knit and led evenly and sweetly, and that legend pertains to the best one 
from Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, which also includes the extermination of the Ten headed evil 
named Ravana, and further, it is said by the sage, hence this may now be listenedâ¦  [1-2-43]

[Commentary] This is balladeers bidding to the audience. The word munipraNiitam reminds that a 
non-saint cannot tell an epic; na anR^ishiH kurute kaavyam and hence it is to be listened 
attentively.



SARGA 3
------------------------------

[Text] The scheming of the composition of epic Ramayana is described here. Whole of the epic 
	is rendered in its quintessence, as to how Sage Valmiki scheduled the narration of important 
	milestones of the epic.

Shlok 1: On hearing the essence of Ramayana from Sage Narada, which is abound with probity and 
	prosperity, and a propitious one too, that virtue-souled Valmiki started searching for 
	further known details in the legend of that dexterous Rama. [1-3-1]

Shlok 2: Valmiki sitting on a sacred grass mat, whose apices are towards east, touched waters, 
	and made his palms adjoined in reverence, and then by his yogic insight started to search 
	comprehensively, for the narrative course of Ramayana. [1-3-2]

[Commentary] Comment: Touching/sipping waters aachamana, pariSechana , before undertaking 
	any auspicious work, including daily meal, is customary, because water cleanses the internal 
	system, both mind and body.

Shlok 3-4: Of Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, also of King Dasharatha and his wives, and what bechanced 
	on Rama when he was in kingdom Ayodhya; Valmiki veritably discerned all that. Their smiles, 
	their conversations, their deeds and the succession of events as well, all of them the 
	sage saw wholly and clearly by the yogic power conferred by Brahma...] [1-3-3,4]

Shlok 5: Then, that which bechanced on truth-abiding Rama, while he is trekking in forests, with 
	a lady being the third partner, where Lakshmana is the lone male aide, Valmiki visualized 
	all that. [1-3-5]

Shlok 6: Then that virtue-souled sage saw what all that has happened earlier, by his yogic exaltation, 
	as though it is a citric fruit in his own palm. [1-3-6]

Shlok 7-8: Discerning all of Ramayana in its actuality by his yogic prowess that highly intellectual 
	Valmiki pioneered to author all of the legend of Rama, for Rama is a delighter of all 
	in all worlds, and whose legend is abounding with the real functional qualities of earthly 
	pleasures and prosperities, and which clearly elaborates the meaning of probity and its 
	operative qualities, and thus this legend is like an ocean replete with such gems called 
	thoughts, and an ear-pleasing legend, as well. [1-3-7, 8]

[Commentary] Comment: The pleasures and gains of the humans are puruSaartha -s, in its axiological 
	meaning. Hindus have four such puruSaartha -s [namely human values,] dharma 
	probity artha prosperity, kaama pleasures, and finally mokSha 
	, blessedness. Of these four only the first three, dharma, artha, kaama are usually 
	referred, and they are called tri-varga . The final one mokSha is not 
	often quoted. Dhrama is the driving force. chodanaa lakShaNaartho dharmaH - Jaimini. 
	Hence dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and it 
	does not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty or, say 'categorical 
	imperative' of Kant. And the other two, artha, kaama , are the means of dharma, 
	and all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured 
	on these puruSaartha -s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts 
	of richness and glory of all kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its 
	main import is the virtuosity of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other 
	less valuable items like conch shells, mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all 
	these peripherals are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody 
	and heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its import is 
	in accordance with all the scriptures.

Shlok 9: That godly saint Valmiki composed the legend of Rama, the legatee of Raghu, exactly as 
	the divine-soul Narada narrated it earlier. [1-3-9]

Shlok 10: The birth of Rama as an incarnation of Vishnu, his very great valour, his gracefulness 
	to all, his universal cordiality, perseverance, courteousness, and his truthful conduct, 
	Valmiki described them all. [1-3-10]

Shlok 11: Narrated are very many other amusing stories, Rama's breaking the great bow; his associated with
	sage vishvamitra... [1-3-11]

Shlok 12: Dispute of Rama and Parashurama; the merits of Rama, the son of Dasharatha; and the preparations 
	for anointing of Rama as crown prince; Queen Kaikeyi's vicious intentions... [1-3-12]

[Commentary] Comment: Rama is shriiraama one who delights in shrii , where shrii 
	is Goddess Lakshmi. Where as Parashurama delights in his axe parashu axe; and 
	Balarama, the brother of Krishna delights in his own bala might.

Shlok 13: Disruption in royal unction of Raghava; his exile to forests; King Dasharatha's grief 
	and bewailing, and thus his departing to other worlds... [1-3-13]

Shlok 14: The grief of the subjects; Rama leaving them off; his conversing with tribal chief Guha; 
	returning the charioteer Sumantra to kingdom from forests, leaving the trio at the banks 
	of river Ganga... all these elements are well- described. [1-3-14]

Shlok 15: Crossing over River Ganga; looking up Sage Bharadwaja; their look up at Chitrakuta on 
	Sage Bharadwaja's advise... [1-3-15]

Shlok 16: Construction of a hermitage and dwelling therein; Bharata's arrival at that place for 
	the graciousness of Rama to take back the kingdom; Rama's denial of it; Rama's offering 
	water oblations to his father on hearing the demise of his father... [1-3-16]

Shlok 17: Enthroning shoe-sandals of Rama by Bharata; Bharata's living in a village Nandigrama; 
	Rama's going to Dandaka forests; killing the demon named Viradha... [1-3-17]

Shlok 18: Rama's visit to Sage Sarabhanga and Suteekshna; their visiting hermitic lady Anasuuya, 
	and her smooth speaking with Seetha and also her giving a body cream to Seetha...[by applying 
	which cream Seetha will not wither away in the rough weather of woods. These details are 
	incorporated with great care.] [1-3-18]

Shlok 19: Also even Rama's seeing the Sage Agastya, and likewise taking a great bow from that sage... 
	also the palaver of Surpanakha, the demoness, and defacing her, likewise... [1-3-19]

Shlok 20: The elimination of demons like Khara, Trishirasa and the upsurge of Ravana thereby; 
	elimination of demon Mareecha, and Ravana's abduction of Vaidehi, likewise... [1-3-20]

Shlok 21: Raghava's anguish at the loss of Seetha; Ravana's slaying the mighty eagle Jatayu; Rama's 
	seeing Kabandha, and also Lake Pampa...[1-3-21]

Shlok 22: Rama's seeing Shabari, a hermetic lady and eating fruits and tubers given by her in utmost 
	adoration; Rama's bemoaning for Seetha; his sighting Hanuma at Lake Pampa... [1-3-22]

Shlok 23: Also going to Mt. Rishyamuka, meeting Sugreeva and generating confidence in Sugreeva, 
	befriending him and the duel of Vali and Sugreeva... [1-3-23]

Shlok 24: Also thus Vali's elimination and establishing Sugreeva on throne of monkey kingdom, grieving 
	of Tara, the wife of Vali and empress of that kingdom, and as consented Rama's stopover 
	during the days of rain... [1-3-24]

[Commentary] Comment: This raatri usually means night. But it includes day also. When saying
	triraatra, dasharaatra, in conducting rituals it includes daytime also. On the 
	whole it is total rainy season that is admirably narrated in KiShkindhaa Kanda.

Shlok 25: The wrath of Raghava, the lion, at the delay caused by Sugreeva, and Sugreeva's foregathering 
	of all troops, and sending them to all quarters, and Sugreeva's description of earth's 
	topography to monkey-troops... [1-3-25]

Shlok 26: Rama's giving his ring to Hanuma as a token for Seetha's recognition... and the monkeys 
	thus searching Riksha cave, bear-cave, and their fasting unto death for their quest 
	remained unsuccessful, and their seeing Sampaati, another mighty eagle and the brother 
	of slain Jatayu, who guides the monkeys to the destination where Seetha is held captive. 
	[1-3-26]

Shlok 27: Hanuma's climbing Mt. Mahendra to leap over the ocean, and on the advice of the Ocean, 
	Mt. Mainaka's coming up from under waters to give rest to Hanuma, and Hanuma's seeing 
	that mountain are depicted. [1-3-27]

Shlok 28: Hanuma's killing the demoness Surasa, and his seeing of Simhika, a rapacious creature 
	of gigantic origin, which captures its prey by the shadow, and Hanuma's killing that Simhika, 
	and his seeing the mountain of Lanka, called Mt. Trikuta, on which the state of Lanka 
	is built, Valmiki described them all. [1-3-28]

Shlok 29: In night Hanuma's entry into Lanka, for being lonely his thinking over the course to search 
	for Seetha, and his going to the liquor consumption place, and also his seeing the palace 
	chambers of Ravana... [1-3-29]

Shlok 30: Hanuma's seeing Ravana, and also his seeing Pushpaka, the divine aircraft, and wandering in Ashoka 
	gardens, his seeing Seetha also... [1-3-30]

Shlok 31: Presenting his credential, the ring of Rama, to Seetha and his talk with Seeta, and also 
	his witnessing the demonesses scaring Seetha to oblige Ravana, and his witnessing demoness 
	Trijata narrating her bad dream, are all narrated in the epic. [1-3-31]

Shlok 32: Seetha's giving her bejeweled hairslide to be shown to Rama, Hanuma's uprooting of the 
	trees of that beautiful Ashoka gardens, thereby the demonesses fleeing in scare, his killing 
	the guards of that garden... [1-3-32]

	Ravana, and also Hanuma's burning down Lanka, and his blaring at the demons, also his 
	return flight from Lanka... and on his way back Hanuma's seeing a honey garden, and the 
	appropriation of honey... [1-3-33]

Shlok 34: Hanuma's action in presenting the jewel sent by Seetha solaces Raghava, and thus the meeting

	and his telling the scheme to kill Ravana to Rama... [1-3-35]

Shlok 37: Crowning of Vibheeshana as the king of Lanka, after the demise of Ravana, and also Rama's 
	seeing Pushpaka, the divine aircraft, and returning to Ayodhya in that aircraft... and 
	Rama's meeting Sage Bharadvaja on his way back... [1-3-37]

Shlok 38: Sending Hanuma to meet Bharata, for he avowed to self-immolate if Rama were not to come 
	in time; the coronation festival of Rama; disbandment of all military troops of monkeys; 
	Rama's ruling his kingdom to the delight of his subjects, and the desolation of Vaidehi 
	too... are described by Valmiki. [1-3-38]

Shlok 39: The godly sage Valmiki composed the futuristic legend of Rama while Rama is on the surface 
	of earth, and whatever that is there, that is composed in all its minuteness, in the coming 
	chapters of this epic. [1-3-39]

[Commentary] Comment: In this verse, some take the word uttare as Uttara Ramayana, the events 
	occurring after his crowning, Seetha's departure to forest, birth of Lava and Kusha, the 
	sons of Rama and a battle between father and sons etc., are ascribed to Valmiki. But to 
	some commentators, as per the format of this chapter, which surveys what Valmiki has scheduled 
	to write, it is unacceptable since the word uttare occurs for only one occasion, 
	hence cannot mean next canto. Thus, they say, Uttara Ramayana cannot be ascribed to Valmiki. 
	Hence the word uttare here is taken to mean henceforth, hereinafter of the epic.



SARGA 4
------------------------------

[Text] Valmiki composed twenty four thousand verses and taught them to Lava and Kusha, the sons of 
Rama and Seetha. The two youngsters sing the ballad among the assemblages of sages and saints, 
and win laurels. Rama on seeing the boys singing on the streets and king's ways of Ayodhya, 
brings them to his palace, and summons all his brothers and ministers to listen to the ballad. 
Rama himself is put to the turmoil, for the ballad sung by these youngsters narrates the legend 
of Seetha. But he himself collecting his calm, Rama paid his attention to listen the 'Legend 
of Seetha' siithaayaH charitam mahat as Valmiki calls Ramayana.

Shlok 1: The godly saint Valmiki composed Ramayana on Rama's retrieving kingdom, wording admirably 
and meaningfully. [1-4-1]

Shlok 2: Sage Valmiki said Ramayana in twenty four thousand verses, in five hundred chapters, in six 
books, likewise an end-piece too. [1-4-2]

[Commentary] The twenty-four are the letters in Gayatri hymn. Ramayana's scheming is based on 
Gayatri hymn and for this: atra caturvi~Nshatisa~Nkhyo uktyaa caturvi~NshatyakSharagaayatrii 
tulyataa suucitaa | prathamaadhyaaye - tapaHsvaadhyaaya - ityatra 
prathamam takaarasya - sargaante - mahatvamiiyaat -- ityatra yaat 
- iti akSharasya grahaNaat api gaayatriiruupatvam suucitam - dharmaakuutam

[Commentary] There is a controversy about the number of verses and cantos. If Uttara Ramayana, otherwise 
called abhudaya-kaanDa, is ascribed to Valmiki, the cantos are seven and chapters 
are about 649 and verses are about 24,253. But some verses and chapters are deleted for standardization 
of Ramayana as per this verse and they contain 560 chapters and 24,00 verses only. Some argue 
that when it is said 24,000 verses are there, it does not actually a mathematical assertion, 
like the calculation of mahaayuga -s and manvantara -s, and as one would 
give a reply to his age as 30 years, or 60 years, but not as 29 years, 6 months, seven days 
or so... In furthering that standardization affair, some said that even this canto, Bala kaanda 
is not authored by Valmiki. It is not clear as of now when the pundits can decide as to which 
is standard and which is not.

[Commentary] The transcendental aspect of Ramayana and its content is explained in 18 terms by ancient 
commentator Govindaraja. 1] Rama's Absoluteness, paramaatmatattva ; 2] Ideation 
to know Him, upaaya ; 3] Dedication in Him, kainkarya ; 4] Human aspect,
puruSaakaara ; 5] Diviner, adhikaara ; 6] Resolve in God, adhikaarapaaratantrya

 ; 7] God's resolve in Dedicate, bhagavatpaaratantrya ; 8] Knowledge 
of five Meanings, arthapancakaj~naana ; 9] Self-denial, akincanatvam ; 
10] Teacher selecting, aacaaryavaraNam ; 11] Climax, autkaNThataa ; 12] 
Behaviour, pravartanaa ; 13] Residence, vaasasthaana ; 14] Two Narayana 
hymns, naaraayaNamantradvaya ; 15] Gayatri, Gayatri hymn; 16] Negating 
negative-thinking, durvicaaraparihaara ; 17] negating Love for Living, samsaarajihaasa
 ; 18] 64 Divinely Arts, catuHSaSTi-kalaamayatva . Of them we take up the 15th Gayatri.

[Commentary] The identification of Gayatri with Ramayana scheme is explained in many ways. By
tat savitR^i the features and attributes of the Absolute as per narrations in Bala 
Kanda. vareNya by the narration of Absolute's attributes in Ayodhya and Kishkindha 
kaanda-s, and adherents like Lakshmana, Bharata, Sugreeva take shelter in Him here only.
bharga is identified as per the description of resplendence of The Divine as envisaged 
by the sages and hermits in Aranya Kanda. devasya and in dhiimahi where 
that deva the Divine is explained by Hanuma, not only to Seetha but to all in Sundara 
kanda. hi dhii mahi is as explained in Uttara Kanda, which centers around mokSha 
salvation.

Shlok 3: Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint 
thought over thus 'really, who will render all this ballad...' [1-4-3]

Shlok 4: Then Lava and Kusha who are in the attire of hermits have touched the feet of that contemplative 
soul Valmiki, who is now thoughtful. [1-4-4]

Shlok 5: Glorious Kusha and Lava are the virtue knowing princes, and they are endowed with melodious 
voice, besides being the residents of the same hermitage, thus Valmiki saw them saluting at 
his feet. [1-4-5]

Shlok 6: On seeing that pair intellectuals who are proficient in Veda-s that self-reliant sage Valmiki 
made those two to memorize the epic, as the epic Ramayana is composed only to reinforce the 
import of Veda-s, as an ancillary. [1-4-6]

Shlok 7: That sage with observed sacred vows has rendered the entire epic in the name of 'Ramayana', 
'Sublime Legend of Seetha' and 'elimination of Ravana'. [1-4-7]

[Commentary] Seetha's conduct is the primary aspect and Ravana's elimination is secondary in the epic of 
Ramayana. poulasthyavadha . Giving one to many names to poem/epics is usual as in
maaghakaavya' which is known as shishupaalavadha whereas it is actually
kR^iShNacarita .

Shlok 8: To read or to sing it is melodious, adaptable to music with three scales and sevenfold tune, 
and orchestral to the tunes of string-instrument and rhythm included... [1-4-8]

[Commentary] The three Indian scale pauses are dR^ita, madhyama, vilambita . These though not 
equal but identical to Breve, Minim and Quaver of Western classical music. The seven fold 
classifications of swara-s are 1] shadja [2] madhyama [3] gaandhaara [4] niSaada [5] R^iSabha 
[6] dhaivata [7] pa~nchama . These are roughly identical to Accelerando, Calando, Decresando, 
Smorzando, Sostentuo, and others of Western classical music.

Shlok 9: Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung 
[by Kusha, Lava.] [1-4-9]

[Commentary] The Indian categorization of aesthetics rasaa -s is in nine emotions. sR^ingaara 
[romance] haasa  [humour] shoka [grief] krodha [fury]
utsaaha [enthusiasm, bravery] bhaya [fright] 
jugupsaa [disgust] vismaya [amaze.] Again sR^ingaara is 
of two kinds - a] sambhoga , [being with his/her partner,] b] vipralamba 
[not being with his/her partner.]

[Commentary] Rama's togetherness with Seetha from Bala Kanda till her abduction is the first category of 
romance. After her departure and until regain, it is second sort of romantic narration. Episodes 
of Surpanakha, Trijata are humorous. Those of Dasharatha, Jatayu etc., are of grievous nature. 
Killing, torturing etc., situations arouse furiousness. Lakshmana, Indrjit and others are 
showing bravery. Seeing ugly demons either in forests or those that surround Seetha is causing 
fright. The very sight of ugly bodied demons like Viradha, Kabandha is creating disgust. Hanuma's 
leaping ocean, burning Lanka, and the entire Rama-Ravana war are amazing

Shlok 10: They are conversant with the art of music and proficient with the pitch and pausing their 
voices, and those two brothers have not only a wealthy voice, but they also look like celestial 
singers. [1-4-10]

[Commentary] The gandharva-s are celestial beings with adorable personalities and performers of all kinds 
of performing arts. Hence, Indian musical art is termed as gaandhava-vidyaa.

Shlok 11: They have charm in their appearance and melodiousness in their voice, they are like the two 
reflections of one original object, and thus they came out from the body of Rama, separately. 
[1-4-11]

[Commentary] Vishnu's reflection is Rama; and Kusha, Lava are two reflections of Rama, and thus, in turn, 
these two princes are adorable like Vishnu, as in bimba-pratibimba nyaaya , image-reflection 
syndrome.

Shlok 12: They the princes have memorized that virtue-expounding epic, the best; in its entirety and 
in doing so, they rendered that epic faultlessly. [1-4-12]

Shlok 13: They sung the epic as schooled, well aware of its content and intent, among the assemblages 
of sages, scholars and also of eminent persons, with their best concentration [1-4-13]

Shlok 14: Once those two great-souls who endowed with musical talent and with all remarkable features, 
sung this epic, standing nearby the midst of a gathering of sages and pious souls. [1-4-14]

Shlok 15: On hearing that, the eyes of all the sages were overspread with tears of happiness, and they 
appreciated saying, 'splendid, splendid is this...' [1-4-15]

Shlok 16: All those saints being the saint-patrons of virtue are pleased at heart, and praised the praiseworthy 
Kusha and Lava, while they are singing. [1-4-16]

Shlok 17: "The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... though this has 
happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... [1-4-17]

Shlok 18: "On getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, that too melodiously 
and rapturously, marinating the pitch and tune..." So said the saints. [1-4-18]

Shlok 19: While the great saints of blessed ascesis are appreciating that way, those two melodiously 
sang very effectually and very meaningfully. [1-4-19]

Shlok 20: And someone, a pleased saint, got up and bestowed a handy vessel to them... another reputed 
sage, lauding them contributed a jute robe. [1-4-20]

Shlok 21-26: And another sage bestowed a black-deerskin, and like that yet another a sacred thread... someone 
gave a water-pot and another great saint a girdle of maunja grass to singers, while that way 
another contributed an under cloth; another sage gladly contributed a hatchet to them, another 
a saffron clothe, and yet another saint bestowed a cloth-wrapper; another delivered tuft-headband 
also, and another enchanted for their singing ballad handed out a sacrificial vessel, and 
another a bundle of firewood sticks, and yet another gave a plank-seat of audambari wood, 
and other called forth blessings, and someone then happily chanted bless-hymns for longevity... 
there by all the truth-avowing saints, those that are great sages have thus bestowed boons. 
[1-4-21-26]

Shlok 26: "Surprising is this well-said rendering of Valmiki... it is the subsistence for tomorrow's 
poets... and this is completed sequentially, as well... [1-4-26]

Shlok 27-28: While this song that generates longevity and prosperity, and one that is melodious one to 
all ears is being sung everywhere in streets and king's ways and while those two singers who 
are experts in singing any kind of music are being appreciated everywhere, Rama has seen them. 
[1-4-27-28]

Shlok 29: Then on seeing them Rama, the enemy-eliminator, fetched those honour-worthy bothers, Lava 
and Kusha, to his palace and honoured them. [1-4-29]

Shlok 30: He that king Rama is then surrounded by his ministers and brothers that are sitting his nearby, 
he himself sat on a divine golden throne. [1-4-30]

Shlok 31: Having seen the mannerly brothers endowed with beautiful features, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, 
and Shatrughna, and Bharata likewise. [1-4-31]

Shlok 32: Rama said to thus, "Let this ballad be keenly heard from these divinely resplendent brothers, 
for it contains versatile words and meanings...' and thus he motivated the singers. [1-4-32]

Shlok 33: Even those two singers have sung the ballad melodiously and effectually, with their clear 
and clarified voices, like the melody of string and rhythmic instruments, with very clear 
and meaningful intonation. [1-4-33]

Shlok 34: Enthralling courtier's bodies, minds and hearts also, and thus that song shone forth as it 
is for all ears, bearing a comfort in its manifestation, among the gathering of the people. 
[1-4-34]

Shlok 35: "These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who also possess kingly features, but they are great 
hermits... this narration is endowing good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious 
legend [of Seetha...]" [So said Rama to those courtiers.] [1-4-35]

[Commentary] Here Rama tells that this legend is 'efficacious' for it is the legend of Seetha, and should 
it be Rama's alone, he will get the blemish of self-glorification, aatmaprashamsaa doSa 
, and brave heroes of legends cannot be subjected to such a blemish. And to listen to the 
legend of his dearest, who at present is not with him, gives a kind of consolation, and thus 
he is asking all of us to listen to siitaayaH caritam mahat ...

Shlok 36: Then those two singers, motivated by Rama's words, sang the ballad in maarga system, for they 
are well versed in it, then even Rama, who is also in the congregation, again to pacify his 
mind, [for the story of Seetha puts his mind to turmoil,] became interested at heart [to continue 
listening Seetha's story...] [1-4-36]



SARGA 5
------------------------------

[Text] We enter the capital of the Emperor Dasharatha. The pomp and glory of his capital is depicted 
along with its town planning and grandeur of the city, and its residents.

Shlok 1-3: Once upon a time, under which victorious kings, starting from Prajapati-s, this entire earth with all its islands is there, among which kings one 
king named Sagara is there, well-known for his deepening the oceans, 
and whom his sixty thousand sons were fencing in when he is set out for action, in the dynasty 
of such Ikshvaku kings this highly revered and reputed epic Ramayana is originated. 
[1-5-1, 3]

Shlok 4: Being such a legend, we two wish to relate this Ramayana entirely and completely from the 
beginning, which is endowed with the values and means of probity, prosperity, and pleasure 
seeking... and this be listened without any caviling. [1-5-4]

Shlok 5: A great kingdom named Kosala, a joyous and a vast one well flourishing with monies and cereals, 
is snugly situated on the riverbanks of Sarayu. [1-5-5]

Shlok 6: A world-renowned city is there in that kingdom, which is personally built by Manu, the foremost 
ruler of mankind. [1-4-6]

Shlok 7: That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s 
breadth wise. [1-5-7]

[Commentary] Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles. 
Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3/4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one
dhanu-graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu-muSTi - fist with thumb 
raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last 
finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one
danDa, dhanuS - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danDa-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s 
= 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanuS-s = one krosha , and also called
goraTa - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 
10 miles. But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries 
say that one yojana is 5 miles. But traditionally it is held as 10 miles. More info on these 
measures can be had from The Artha-Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin.

Shlok 8: That city shines forth with well-laid great royal highways that are always wetted with water, 
and with flowers strewn and scattered on them. [1-5-8]

Shlok 9: As an improver of great kingdom Dasharatha the king made her as his abode, as Indra made heavens 
as his abode. [1-5-9]

Shlok 10: That city is surrounded with gateways and archways; the front yards of buildings are well 
laid; it is lodges all kinds of machinery, weaponry and craftsmen, and king Dasharatha dwells 
in such a city. [1-4-10]

Shlok 11: She that prosperous city Ayodhya is muchly crammed with many a eulogist and panegyrist, yet 
she is highly splendorous with many a bastion, flag and hundreds of batteries of canons, and 
Dasharatha dwells therein. [1-5-11]

[Commentary] Comment: This shataghnii literally is that which can kill a hundred people, and 
it is said to be a canon and also said to be thorny weapon: shataghniicatuHtalaalohakaNTakasa~ncitaa |
 ayaHkaNTakasa~ncchannaa mahatii shilaa -- elaborate accounts of 
this shataghni, kshipaNi are there in yajuraaraNyaka .

Shlok 12: That city Ayodhya accommodates groups of danseuses and theatrical personnel, and she is surrounded 
everywhere with the gardens and brakes of mango trees, and her wide fort-wall is like her 
cincture ornament. [1-5-12]

Shlok 13: That Ayodhya is an impassable one for trespassers, or for others invaders, owing to her impassable 
and profound moats, and she is abounding with horses, camels, likewise with cows and donkeys. 
[1-5-13]

Shlok 14: With the throngs of provincial kings who come hither to pay dues pervade that city, and she 
is verily lustrous with residents of various other countries, and with traders, too. In such 
a city Dasharatha dwells. [1-5-14]

Shlok 15: Buildings are ornamentally studded with precious gems, and with such multi-storied sky scrappers 
she is adorned, and filled with them she is like Amaravati, the capital of Indra. [1-5-15]

Shlok 16: Amazing is Ayodhya for its lay-out is like a game board called aSTapadi, and with 
its flocks of beautiful women moving thereabout, where all kinds of precious gems are heaped 
up, and where its seven storied buildings are picturesque. [1-5-16]

Shlok 17: The housing is very dense and there is no place or ground unutilized, and all are constructed 
on well-levelled lands, and rice-grain is plentiful while the drinking water tastes like sugar 
cane juice. [1-5-17]

Shlok 18: That city is sounding with the drumbeats of great drums, and with musical rhythm instruments 
like mridanga, cymbals, and with string instruments like Veena etc., and on earth she is uniquely 
the best city. [1-5-18]

[Commentary] Great drums, called dundubhi , placed on castle walls and at central places to drum 
the times of the day or night, or at the arrivals of the noblemen or to keep the sentry whistles. 
As well, the melodious tunes from string instruments like Veena or rhythmic instrument
mridanga and from various other instruments are always made available to the citizens, 
as a sort of background music, since royalty sponsors these performing arts.

Shlok 19: Ayodhya is like a hovering space station attained by sages by their ascesis, and its edifices 
are well planned and it is teeming with best people. [1-4-19]

Shlok 20: They the skilful archers of that Ayodhya will not kill a lone one with their arrows, one that 
does not have either a predecessor or a successor in his family, a fleeing one, or by listening 
to the sound of the target, as is done in sonic-archery, and their skills, acumen and handiness 
are thus benevolent. [1-5-20]

[Commentary] Dasharatha in his youth, when he was on a hunting spree, killed the son of a hermit who was 
drawing water from a river. That son of the sage dipped his pot in the waters and the filling 
water gave sounds like that of a grumbling tiger. Dasharatha mistook that sound to be a tiger's 
grumble and swung his arrow that way, killing the boy. Thereby the father of the boy being 
a sage of eminence, cursed Dasharatha to die lamenting for his son, which happens after the 
exile of Rama. Perhaps the sonic-archery may thus have been banned in Ayodhya, lest such sad 
incidents would have recurred.

Shlok 21: They kill the fattened and roaring lions, tigers and wild boars with the might of their sharp 
weaponry, or even with the might of their own arms alone. [1-4-21]

Shlok 22: With that kind of thousands of archers, and with speediest chariot-warriors she that Ayodhya 
is filled with, and King Dasharatha made his abode in such a city. [1-5-22]

Shlok 23: She that Ayodhya is encompassed with Vedic scholars who always worship the ritual fire by 
enkindling the three kinds of ritual-fires continuously, virtuous Brahman scholars in Veda-s 
and their six ancillary subjects, and other great souls that are in similitude with great 
saints, and who are just like sages that are charitable donors, and that abide by the truth. 
[1-5-23]



SARGA 6
------------------------------

[Text] The riches and happiness enjoyed by the people, under the rein of Emperor Dasharatha, 
			along with the details of its valiant heroes, elephants, horses and the town planning 
			are narrated.

Shlok 1-4: He who is well-versed in Veda-s, who is a gatherer of all scholars, riches and 
			forces as well, a foreseer and a great resplendent one, also one who is esteemed 
			by urbanites and countrymen alike, one who is a top-speeded chariot-warrior among 
			the emperors of Ikshwaku kings, one who has performed many Vedic rituals, a virtuous 
			one, a great controller, a saint-like kingly sage, one who he is renowned in all 
			the three worlds, a mighty one with all his enemies eradicated, nevertheless who 
			has friends, one who conquered all his senses, one who is similar to Indra, or 
			Kubera on earth with his wealth, accumulations and other possessions, he that 
			king Dasharatha while dwelling in the city of Ayodhya protected the world, like 
			Manu, the foremost protector of mankind. [1-6-3,4,5]

Shlok 5: He that truth-abiding king, who adheres to the three-fold virtues rules the vast 
			of that kingdom from that best city Ayodhya, as Indra rules heaven from his capital 
			Amaravati. [1-6-5]

Shlok 6: In that best city Ayodhya all are exuberant yet virtuous ones, and scholars are 
			variously learned ones, people are satisfied with their own riches, they have 
			no greed, and they advocate truthfulness alone. [1-6-6]

Shlok 7: None with meagre accumulations is there in that great city and no householder 
			is there without unearned means, and without cows, horses, monies or cereals and 
			who could not sustain his family. [1-6-7]

[Commentary] An ordinary family kuTumba is an assemblage of the householder, his wife, 
			two of his parents, two sons, two daughters-in-law, one daughter, and one guest, 
			totalling to ten members.

Shlok 8: None can see a lustful person, or a miser or a cruel one anywhere in that Ayodhya, 
			along with nondescripts or non-believers, for there are no such persons. [1-6-8]

Shlok 9: All the ladies and gentlemen in that city are virtuous in mind, self-controlled 
			ones, they are all self-satisfied like great saints, and both in their conduct 
			and character they are blameless. [1-6-9]

Shlok 10: In that city none is there without his earrings, headgear, or garlands, none is 
			an enjoyer of lowly things, or misses his regular oil-baths, or with an un-creamed 
			body with sandalwood paste or with other body cream, or with an un-perfumed physique. 
			[1-6-10]

[Commentary] Earrings are the indicators of scholarship, and there are grades in their make 
			and design, on par with the education one receives. The headgears present their 
			social status, while other decorations are to exhibit their lavishness.

Shlok 11: There is none who is famsihed, an uncharitable one in his nature, one with an 
			undecorated body with ornaments like bracelets or chest plates, and there is none 
			without a heart. [1-6-11]

Shlok 12: There is none someone who is without sacrificial fires, and none without performing 
			sacrificial rituals, and none is low in living; neither an immoral, nor a bastard 
			nor even a thief, can be found in Ayodhya. [1-6-12]

Shlok 13: The sense-controlled scholarly Vedic Brahmans are always engaged in their rituals, 
			and they donate the education of Vedas to their students, as well practice their 
			own, and while receiving donations they are principle-minded. [1-6-13]

[Commentary] The donations received by Vedic scholars are not alms to beggars or charities 
			to the destitute. The Vedic scholars do not receive them from anybody or everybody. 
			There are set rules to accept such donations like cows, gold coins, villages, 
			temples etc., from a befitting hand. Otherwise, the recipient is destined to go 
			to Hell for having received greedily. Thus, if ever somebody wants to donate to 
			such a scholar he should first notify his bona fides, which are verifiable by 
			the recipient. Another kind of donation is referred here as daana-aadhyaana, 
			meaning that these scholars while receiving donations from a righteous source, 
			they also have to donate something to others. It is the education in Veda, which 
			they have to impart to their students free of any charge and that too, to the 
			befitting students only. Thus, the words, daana and pratigrahaNa 
			mean all these rules to accept a donation or to accord it.

Shlok 14: There is no atheist, no liar, and none is less learnt in Veda-s, and no one is 
			found to be jealous, or disabled, or unscholarly person. [1-6-14]

Shlok 15: None can be found anywhere in Ayodhya without the knowledge of the six ancillaries 
			of Veda-s like astrology, prosody, grammar etc., none a non-performer of the prescribed 
			rituals, and none a non-donor in thousands, thus none with a saddened heart, turmoil 
			in mind or agonised in will is there. [1-6-15]

Shlok 16: Whoever it may be, either a gentleman or a lady, none is without wealth, even 
			none without elegance or devoid of devotion to their king, and it is impossible 
			to see suchlike person in Ayodhya. [1-6-16]

Shlok 17: In the four-caste system, from the first caste to the last, everyone is a worshipper 
			of deities and guests and everyone is also faithful, illustrious, valiant, and 
			each one is a brave one. [1-6-17]

[Commentary] Though the word 'caste - Spanish and Portuguese casta - lineage, race, breed' is 
			distasteful, it is used here for an easy communication. Latin classis - assembly' 
			or section of society would be more suitable.

Shlok 18: Longevity is there for all of the people, all are with virtuosity and truthfulness, 
			and they lived in that best city along with their sons, grandsons and their ladies. 
			[1-6-18]

Shlok 19: The warrior class Kshatriya-s is turned towards the Brahmans, the scholarly class, 
			for intellectual and religious support. The trading class, Vaisya-s, is the follower 
			of the Kshatriya-s, the ruling class, for the state's economy is dependent on 
			the rulership. And the fourth one, Shuudra-s, the working class, while performing 
			its own duties, is always working for the other castes. [1-6-19]

Shlok 20: That city is well protected by that king from Ikshwaku dynasty namely Dasharatha, 
			like Manu, the foremost king of mankind in earlier times. [1-6-20]

Shlok 21: That city Ayodhya is replete with firebrand like skillful warriors that are intolerant 
			of insults, and who have prosecuted their education in archery, chariot-wars, 
			swordplay etc. and with them it is like a cave replete with lions. [1-6-21]

Shlok 22: That city is full with best horses born in countries like Kaambhoja, Baahlika, 
			Vanaayu, and also in river-bed counties, which are like the horse of Indra namely 
			ucChaishrava. [1-6-22]

[Commentary] It is said that the horses born in the rivers nadii+ja are brought to the city 
			Ayodhya. They are not water horses but horses born at the place where the historically 
			prominent Seven Rivers of Indus Valley Rivers flow.

[Commentary] Here again an account of countries 
			is given as a glimpse. These countries Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu may not be taken 
			as the provincial countries within the present day India. Prior to the present-day 
			peninsular India, the belt from Himalayas to Alps had a great rapport in cultural 
			and trade exchanges without demarcations of east or west, which paved the way 
			for Alexander, the Great, towards India.

[Commentary] Sometime back, say during 1985-87, the 
			National Geography magazine contained a beautiful article under the heading "
			IRAQ, the crucible of civilisation ," Merle Severy, as its Asst. Editor. 
			In its carefully worded introduction, it is stated that Iraq is "the traditional 
			birthplace of man for Jews, Christians and Muslims... " On the other hand, 
			Hindus naturally believe that the Southward Himalayan region is the birthplace 
			of man. In the same article, the regions around Euphrates and Tigris are said 
			to be the "Fertile Crescent, the cradle of Western civilization ... in the 
			third millennium BC ". Further that " To the east a similar florescence 
			occurred in the Indus and Yellow River Valleys... " This florescence in Indus 
			Valley and far eastward did not occur later to Mesopotamian or Babylonian civilisations 
			but flourished much earlier, as per Hindu scripts and the dating of which is the 
			eternal question like Aryan Question. However, Hindu scripts centre the present 
			world, Bhuuloka, surrounding Meru Mountain and its geography includes the land 
			unto Rome, Russia, China. We will refer to Meru mountain-oriented geography and 
			its geographical account at the appropriate place. Since Ramayana dates back to 
			Buddhism and Buddhism's westward spread is unto Afghanistan, the Kings of Ramayana 
			must have had no problem to draft horses from Persian, Arabian or the other of 
			Middle East countries. These countries are always famous for horse breeding, right 
			from the days of Ramayana to Moses. Hence the accounts of horses and the countries 
			from where they are brought may be treated as cross-continental culture. Since 
			history believes only in the unearthed iconography and the epics or their content 
			can not stand to the carbon-testing, the countries named here as Kambhoja, Baahlika 
			may nearly mean Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Arabian or other unknown or unearthed 
			historic countries of the crucible of Western civilisation, Iraq. Vanaayu, another 
			country referred may nearly mean Roman, as Persians term Greeks as Unani in India, 
			advent to the arrival of Alexander, the Great. We still have an herbal medication 
			called Unani, a hybrid between Ayurveda, Greek and Persian herbal treatments.

Shlok 23: Born in Vindhya Mountains, and also from Himalayan regions, mighty are the elephants 
			fully vigorous and fattened ones, and most powerful in their strength and each 
			in similitude is a huge mountain. [1-6-23]

Shlok 24: High bred from the classes of Airavata, the Elephant of Lord Indra, and from Mahapadma, 
			Anjana and Vamana, too...are the elephants [of that city] [1-6-24]

[Commentary] It is said that eight elephants from eight corners called aSTadiggaja 
			support the Universe. And these eight elephants have their presiding deities. 
			From those eight elephants, four are prominent. They are Airaavata , the 
			Elephant of Indra, anjana , the Elephant of varuNa , the Rain-god,
			vaamana , the Elephant of Yama, the Lord of Death, and another is 
			punDariika . Thus, the elephants of Ayodhya are termed as divine breed.

Shlok 25-26a: That city is always full with vigorous and mountain like elephants bred mainly 
			from three classes viz., Bhadra, Mandra and Mriga. And inter-bred among these 
			three main classes are Bhadra-Mandra, Mandra-Mriga, Bhadra-Mriga and the like. 
			[1-6-25]

[Commentary] The bhadra is the elephant class for King's ride, called bhadragaja 
			. It is a state elephant with high honors and for occasional or ceremonial use.
			mandra and mR^iga are classes of breed tamed and used in wars 
			or for the ride of other nobility. These are the essential mammals used for other 
			lifting and carrying works.

Shlok 26b: While residing in which city King Dasharatha ruled the world that city is further 
			fortified up to two more yojana-s outside city, true to its name
			a yodhya , an un-assailable one. [1-6-26]

Shlok 27: In which city the great resplendent and admirable king Dasharatha resided, he 
			ruled the world from that city with silenced enemies, like the moon governing 
			the stars. [1-6-27]

Shlok 28: With gorgeous arches, castle-door-bars and with amazingly built houses that city 
			is magnificent and auspicious one, and full with thousands of provincial kings 
			too, and king Dasharatha, a coequal of Indra, indeed ruled that city which is 
			true to its name. [1-6-28]



SARGA 7
------------------------------

[Text] The truthful and upright characters of the ministers of Dasharatha are portrayed, 
			who make the rulership meaningful with their virtuous, skilful and efficient administration. 
			Along with the political ministers, the religious ministry is also portrayed.

Shlok 1: The misters for the great soul from Ikshvaku kings of Emperor Dasharatha, are 
			epitomised ones of their tactfulness, adroitness and are always obliged to undertake 
			welfare activities of their king and the kingdom. [1-7-1]

Shlok 2: Eight ministers are there for that valiant and glorious King Dasharatha, who are 
			clean at heart and are involved in the works of the king and kingdom at all time. 
			[1-7-2]

Shlok 3: Dhristi, Jayantha, Vijaya, Suraashtra, Raashtravardhana, Akopa, Dharmapaala, are 
			seven, and Sumantra is the eighth one. [1-7-3]

Shlok 4: Two venerable saints of eminence are religious ministers for they are authorities 
			in Vedic rituals, namely Vashishta and Vamadeva, who are the acquiescent with 
			religious matters, and apart from these two some more religious ministers are 
			also there to King Dasharatha. [1-7-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: Suyajna, Jabaali, Kaashyapa, Gautama, Maarkandeya, Deerghaayu, and then Kaatyayana 
			are the scholarly Brahmans acting as religious ministers, and along with them 
			there are also Brahma-sages who are always the ancestral ritual scholars for Dasharatha's 
			family. [1-7-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 8a: All the ministers are well versed in scriptures, they shun bad deeds, skilful 
			ones in their duties with their senses regulated. Those great souls are affluent, 
			knowers of all sciences, firmly courageous, and they are distinguished and quiet-souls, 
			and those ministers are true to their word. They are magnificent, patient and 
			famed ones and they smile afore they converse. [1-7-6b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: They never speak untruthful words in anger or in greed or for monetary reasons 
			either. There is nothing unknown to them, even a little, in their own country 
			or in the others either, or about everything that is happening or has happened, 
			or that is going to happen, for they know them through agents. [1-7-8b, 9]

Shlok 10: They are efficient in administration and their friendships are well examined by 
			the king, and those ministers impose punishment even on their own sons, if situation 
			demands it. [1-7-10]

Shlok 11: In collections to their treasury and to militarise their armies they are dutiful, 
			even an unfriendly person will not be tortured, if he were not really blameworthy. 
			[1-7-11]

Shlok 12: They are valiant ones with engineered enthusiasm, administrators of political 
			science, clean persons and protectors of subjects of their kingdom at all times. 
			[1-7-12]

Shlok 13: They do not persecute Brahman-s and Kshatriya-s to fill-up the treasury, and high 
			degree punishments will be given on assessing that person's, or the offender's 
			strength and weakness. [1-7-13]

Shlok 14: All of those ministers are clean administrators of kingdom, and are in league 
			with each other, as such there is none anywhere, either in capital or in country, 
			a liar. [1-7-14]

Shlok 15: None with an evil-mind or with an interest in other man's wife is there, and thus 
			on whole in the kingdom and also like that in the capital, there is an undisturbed 
			society. [1-7-15]

Shlok 16: Well-dressed and well-decorated and they the ministers of King Dasharatha, observe 
			decency in the interest of the king and also of the kingdom, with diligence and 
			with a truthful-eye. [1-7-16]

Shlok 17: They acquired good qualities from their mentors and they are renowned by their 
			expertise, and even in foreign countries they are famous for their intellectual 
			determinations in all affairs. [1-7-17]

Shlok 18: Versatile and virtuous are they the ministers and there is none who discarded 
			his virtuosity, and they are the determiners of truce or war, and by their nature 
			they possess opulence. [1-7-18]

Shlok 19: They are capable to keep up the confidentialities of strategies, and also capable 
			to apply their mind even in micro-affairs, and they know moral science comprehensively, 
			and above all, they are gentle articulators. [1-7-19]

Shlok 20: Accompanied with such of those effectual and good-natured ministers the exalted 
			king Dasharatha ruled the earth. [1-7-20]

Shlok 20-21: He that most generous one among men, Dasharatha, while observing through spies, 
			and to protect people righteously, and to give a good governance to them, he forsook 
			unrighteousness and became a generous king avowed to truthfulness alone, and thus 
			he that Dasharatha ruled the earth, which rulership is renowned in all the three 
			worlds. [1-7-21,22]

Shlok 23: Emperor Dasharatha has not encountered either a superior or an equal in his kingship, 
			and to him there are many friends, subdued are his provincial kings and eliminated 
			is thorniness by his own valour. He thus ruled the world like Indra would in Heaven. 
			[1-7-23]

Shlok 24: In the company of those ministers, who are conducive to the strategies, interested 
			in the king and subjects as well, skilful and efficient ones, he that King Dasharatha 
			obtained brilliance, like the rising Sun along with resplendent sunrays. [1-7-24]



SARGA 8
------------------------------

[Text] Dasharatha decides to perform an elaborate Vedic ritual, called Aswamedha yajna, Horse Ritual, to beget
children. He being a considerate king in taking conscience of the courtiers, he discusses this aspect with the Vedic
scholars and ministers of his court, beforehand.

Shlok 1: To him, to such an effectual and virtuously great-souled King Dasharatha, a dynasty-enriching son is
not begotten though his heart is burning to beget children. [1-8-1]

Shlok 2: To that anguished great-soul, a thought occurred this way, "To beget sons, why should not I perform
Horse ritual...[and thus appease the gods in order to beget worthy sons..."] [1-8-2]

Shlok 3: That intellectual and a conscientious king having resolved with all of his sagacious ministers that such
a Vedic ritual is performable, then addressed best ne among ministers, namely Sumantra, "fetch all my teachers and
clerics, quickly.." [1-8-3,4]

Shlok 5: Then Sumantra gone quickly, for he in quickness is a dauntless one, and fetched all of the clerics like
Suyajna, Vaama Deva, Jaabala, Kashyapa, and even Sage Vashishta, and also those other eminent Brahman that are Vedic
scholars. [1-8-5,6]

Shlok 7: Then on adoring them virtuous King Dasharatha spoke this impressible sentence that included
justification and meaning. [1-8-7]

Shlok 8: "My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... for that reason, I wish perform Aswamedha,
Vedic Horse Ritual... this is my thinking... [1-8-8]

Shlok 9: "Therefore, I contemplate to perform that ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and as a rite-oriented
one as well... let this contemplation of mine be well thought of... and as to how my desire to beget sons will be
fulfilled... [1-8-9]

Shlok 10: Then the Brahman scholars along with Sage Vashishta and all other important personalities in their turn
have blessed and honoured him, saying that "splendid is this idea..." thus, for that which is voiced by the king.
[1-8-10]

Shlok 11: All of them becoming happy have also said to King Dasharatha, "let the paraphernalia be provided, and
your ritual-horse be released... [1-8-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: "Oh, king, by all means you will beget sons as you desired, since you, to whom an upright thinking has
suggested itself... let the ritual ground be arranged on the northern banks of River Sarayu..." So said the scholars.
[1-8-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b: " Then King Dasharatha is gladdened on hearing the sayings of those Brahmans. And with happiness
lurching on his eyes the king spoke to the ministers, "As advised by my Vedic teachers let the paraphernalia be
procured... [1-8-13b, 14]

Shlok 15: "On the northern banks of River Sarayu the ritual ground be arranged... and the Ritual-Horse be released
monitored by capable warriors, along with the religious teachers..." So said the king. [1-8-15]

Shlok 16: "Let peace invocations be prevailing and prospering, as ordained in the scriptures and tradition...if it
is possible for the correct performance to obtain results of this ritual, and if it is possible to conduct this ritual
without any difficult faults during its performance, then all the kings on earth would have performed it... [1-8-16]

Shlok 17: "Scholarly Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults alone in the course of this ritual... should the
procedure of this ritual be depraved of its set rules, the performer gets ruined... [1-8-17]

Shlok 18: "Therefore, you all shall see as to how this ritual of mine be conducted and concluded procedurally, and
all of you are evidently experts in conducting such rituals... isn't it! [1-8-18]

[Commentary] Vedic Brahmans are to be very cautious and vigilant while performing the ritual in the order of
ritual acts, faultless rendering of the Vedic hymns and other observant items of the Vedic canon. Should they by
overconfidence or by negligence commit any mistake or fault, they take rebirth as Brahma-demons. After taking rebirth
as such demons they, with their inherent jealousy and ire will always be hunting for such mistakes in other's ritual
performances. If they cannot find one, they cause certain hindrances in that performance, so that the performer may
commit mistakes and get ruined in the present life span and then take rebirth as Brahma-demon. Hence, every
Vedic-ritual performer shall be vigilant.

Shlok 19: On listening the words of the king all the ministers adored and assured him saying, 'It will be
conducted faultlessly as has been conducted earlier...' [1-8-19]

Shlok 20: On hearing those words of that best king, and what that is spoken earlier, then the virtue knowing
Brahman scholars hailing that best king took leave of him and went away as they have come. [1-8-20]

Shlok 21: Then on sending off those Brahman scholars, the king spoke this way to the ministers... "As advised by
the Vedic scholars this ritual shall be conducted, procedurally..." [1-8-21]

Shlok 22: Tha tigerly-king and highly intellectual Dasharatha, on saying thus to his ministers who are still in
his audience, sent away those ministers also, and he entered his palace. [1-8-22]

Shlok 23: And on approaching his wives, that best king's heartily dear ones, he said to them, " I am performing a
Vedic ritual for the reason of begetting sons, and you all shall enter a vow..." [1-8-23]

Shlok 24: On hearing those words of the king, the lustrous countenances of the queens have become more gleaming,
like the blooming lotuses after the clearance of dew-fall. [1-8-24]

[Text] Sumantra, the minister of King Dasharatha, details the importance of Sage Rishyasringa and 
beseeches the king to invite that sage to preside over the contemplated Vedic ritual, for 
that Sage's entry into any kingdom is auspicious for that land and people.

Shlok 1: Sumantra, the charioteer and one of the misters of King Dasharatha, having heard all about 
the king's desire to perform a Vedic ritual, said this in confidence to king, "oh, king, I 
will tell an early legend, an early legendary narration that I listened... [1-9-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "Oh, king, I have earlier heard of this present advice given to you by Vedic scholars, as 
godly Sage Sanatkumara has once narrated an account about the arrival of your sons in the 
presence of other sages, and sage Sanat Kumara said... [1-9-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4: "He said that "Sage Kashyapa has a son known as Vibhaandaka, and his son will be the renowned 
Sage Rishyasringa, and that Sage Rishyasringa will grow up in forests, and will always be 
dwelling in forest... [1-9-3b, 4]

[Commentary] Here the word used by Sumantra is tava putraagamam , it renders as 'the arrival 
of your sons', meaning that sons of King Dasharatha arrive from Heavens, but not through an 
ordinary parturition. Even earlier in time to that of Dasharatha, Sage Sanatkumara predicted 
the 'arrival' of Vishnu as Rama. The birth-event associated with Rishyasringa's name is that 
he is born with a horn on the crown of his head. Thus he is named as Rishyasringa, i.e., em> 
R^iSi the Sage; shR^i~Nga horn; a Sage with a horn on his forehead at his birth time. 
This being the mythological import, he is an acme among sages, as shR^i~Nga also 
means a peak.

Shlok 5: 



"Not knowing others, that Brahman the best, namely Rishyasringa, will always be abiding his 
father and he will follow celibacy of two kinds Brahmanical vows namely
vratitva , praajaapatya ...



Not knowing others that Brahman the best, will always be abiding his father, lest his renowned 
celibacy always praised by the Brahmans, will be hindered. [1-9-5]

[Commentary] The word dvaividhyam also means two kinds of celibacy, vratitva and 
prajaapatyam. One, as a bachelor and the other after marriage, voluntarily distancing 
away from his wife on certain forbidden days like full moon and new moon days, during daytime, 
eclipses, and other astronomical occurrences and some more. This kind of self-imposed celibacy 
is one way of observing sustained family planning methods, instead of resorting to medicaments. 
Here, this word is more nearer to mean 'hindrance', than to mean the 'two way celibacy' as 
deciphered by some commentators.

Shlok 6: "In the world he becomes famous for his celibacy, oh king, and he will always be praised by 
Brahmans, and thus time will pass on with that kind of his conduct. [1-9-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: Sage Rishyasringa looses no time with his servitor-ship to the Sacrificial Fire and also to 
his celebrated father, and during this period alone there will be a famed and very strong 
king Romapaada, a valiant in Anga country... [1-9-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: "But by a violation of righteousness of that king there will be a shocking and devastating 
famine in that country...[1-9-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "While the famine is besetting that king Roamapada will be afflicted with grim, and on summoning 
Brahmans and learned scholars he will address them... [1-9-9b. 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "All of you are well versed in rituals and knowers of the world history... order me how to 
how the purification from sin will be... [1-9-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: "Thus said by king those scholarly Brahmans and Vedic scholars will say to the king, 'oh, 
king, son of Sage Vibhaandaka, namely Rishyasringa, is to be fetched by all methods... [1-9-11b, 
12]

Shlok 13: "Oh! King, having brought Sage Rishyasringa and honouring him well with good care, procedurally 
give him your daughter Shanta in marriage to that Vedic Brahman and the son of Sage Vibhaandaka... 
[1-9-13]

Shlok 14: "On listening them the king becomes thoughtful about the idea by which it is possible to bring 
that self-controlled sage to his place... [1-9-14]

Shlok 15: "Then that intellectual king decides along with ministers, to dispatch clergymen and ministers, 
honouring them well, and then sends them... [1-9-15]

Shlok 16: "They on hearing king's words are awestruck and lowering their faces they will say, 'we can 
not go there as we are afraid of sage Vibhandaka, father of Rishyasringa...' [1-9-16]

Shlok 17: "After thinking over they will say as a second thought, and having found a solution with a 
plan to bring that sage, 'we will fetch that Brahman and also by that no stigma will occur...' 
[1-9-18]

Shlok 18: "Thus by the king of Anga kingdom and by his courtesans the son of sage Rishyasringa will 
be brought and the presiding deity for rains will shower rains, and Shanta will also be given 
in marriage to that sage...' [1-9-18]

Shlok 19: "Sage Rishyasringa, son-in-law of Romapaada, King of Anga ad as well as to you, if invited 
to our kingdom he will bless you to beget sons, oh! King... so said Sage Sanatkumaara to other 
sages and all this is retold by me." [Thus the charioteer and the Minister Sumantra completed 
his narration in confidence to King Dasharatha.] [1-9-19]

[Commentary] Sage Rishyasringa is also a son-in-law to King Dasharatha. Princess Shanta, in a distant relationship 
is a daughter to King Dasharatha in relation and the adopted daughter of Romapaada, the King 
of Anga. Thus Sumantra's saying son-in-law also means Dasharatha's son-in-law, besides Romapada's.

Shlok 20: Then King Dasharatha is delighted and in turn spoke to Sumantra "By what idea Rishyasringa 
is brought to Anga kingdom, that shall be said elaborately..." [1-9-20]



SARGA 10
------------------------------

[Text] Sumantra, the minister continues his narration to his king Dasharatha, about Rishyashringa's 
arrival at Anga kingdom of King Romapaada and his marriage with Princess Shantha, the daughter 
of Romapada.

Shlok 1: Sumantra thus motivated by King Dasharatha, said these words to king "Oh! King, how and with 
which idea Sage Rishyasringa is brought by the ministers of Romapada, all that will be spoken... 
that may please be listened from me along with ministers... [1-10-1]

Shlok 2: "The ministers along with clergyman have spoken this way to King Romapaada, "this is a non-harmful 
plan, well thought over by us..." [1-10-2]

Shlok 3: "Rishyasringa is a forest-dweller absorbed in ascesis and self-study of Vedic scriptures, 
and he is not aware of women, or of worldly-matters or of even worldly-pleasures...[1-10-3]

Shlok 4: "With much desired sense-pleasing objects that will be disquieting the minds of men, we wish 
bring him to the city... Let it be decided quickly... [1-10-4]

Shlok 5: "Beautiful and well decorated courtesans will go there to bring him hither by tempting with 
many a feint, and let the courtesans be given ample gifts... [1-10-5]

Shlok 6: "Hearing that the King replied the priest, "Let it be so..." and then the priests and ministers 
have carried out the plan that way... [1-10-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "On hearing that order of the king those best courtesans have entered that great forest, and 
they camped not very far from that hermitage, making all the trials for showing themselves 
off to a glance of that sage. [1-10-7]

[Commentary] Any dictionary would give the meaning of courtesan as 'whore' or as 'court mistress'. But 
in Indian context, the courtesan is not to be taken in such a lowly way as just a prostitute 
or a whore. They belong to a caste/class of artists. Juxtaposed to the Four-Caste system there 
was a devadasi Temple Dancers system, which is the artist's class. On their receiving 
enough education and skills in the performing arts and as per their capabilities, they will 
be nominated as Court Dancers or Temple Dancers and the like. Ancients recognized sixty-four 
arts chatuSSaSThi-kalaa , which include right from music, dance, and drama, sculpture, 
painting etc., up to the art of thievery. Kings in their political or sovereign pursuits variedly 
used these Deva Daasis, the courtesans.

Shlok 8b- 9: "Always satisfied is sage Rishyasringa to be in hermitage, thus he never stirred out of that 
hermitage, and thus he has not seen any female, or a male, or even any other objects of pleasure, 
either of city or of countryside from the time of birth onwards... [1-10-8b, 9]

[Commentary] Rishyasringa is thus not aware of gender differentiation or exposed to any other object of 
pleasure, and thus his father conditioned him to achieve some supreme ritual ideal.

Shlok 10: "Then at one time Rishyasringa casually arrived at that place, and has seen those comely females. 
[1-10-10]

Shlok 11: "They the lustful women are amazingly attired and singing melodious tunes, all of them neared 
the sage's son and spoke these words... [1-10-11]

Shlok 12: "Who you are? Why you move lonely in these deep and desolate forests, why you conduct yourself 
like this? Oh! Brahman, we are interested to know... please tell us..." [1-10-12]

Shlok 13: "Those women are in most desirable form and hitherto he has not seen such forms in that forest, 
hence a kind of friendship spouted, with which he is inclined to detail about his father... 
[1-10-13]

Shlok 14: "My father is Sage Vibhandaka and I am his true descent son. I am known as Rishyasringa, by 
my name and by an event on my birth, and thus renowned on earth..."

[Commentary] The birth-event associated with his name is that he is born with a horn on the crown of his 
head. Thus he is named as Rishyasringa, i.e., R^iSi= the Sage; sR^i~Nga= horn; a Sage with 
a horn, and this here he recalls his birth time event.

Shlok 15: "Our hermitage is here only, oh, august ones, I wish to perform scripturally worship to you 
all verily there..." thus said the sage to the courtesans. [1-10-15]

Shlok 16: "On hearing the words of sage's son, all those courtesans are verily inclined to see the threshold 
of that hermitage, then all the women went to hermitage. [1-10-16]

Shlok 17: "On going there, then the Sage's son performed worship saying "Here is our hand-wash, here 
is our feet-wash, here are our tuber fruits, here are the juicy fruits of ours... " [1-10-17]

[Commentary] This portrays the exclusion of the sage's son from the rest of the world by his father. He 
worshipped the courtesans, as he would worship some super-natural deities by saying the above 
words, which will usually be used in ritual worship of Hindu deities. He being a fruitarian 
has offered the courtesans the tuber fruits like sweet potatoes etc., which are ridiculous 
to urbanites, that too to the pleasure-taking courtesans.

Shlok 18: "All of them have received that kind of worship much enthusiastically, but dread at the arrival 
of the sage Vibhandaka, they quickly made-up their mind to make away from there. [1-10-18]

Shlok 19: " 'Take these important fruits of ours, oh, Brahman, you be safe, oh, holy one... eat them 
before long....' Said courtesans to Rishyasringa.] [1-10-19]

Shlok 20: "Then all of the courtesans have embraced him and all of them with a kind of mirthfulness 
in the offing, presented sweet-balls and other varieties of best sweetmeats to him. [1-10-20]

Shlok 21: "Having relished the sweets, that resplendent sage supposed them to be fruits only, for he 
did not taste sweets earlier, as he is always forest-bound. [1-10-21]

Shlok 22: "Taking leave of the Sage Rishyasringa on pretence that they also have to perform devotional 
duties, they the courtesans departed from there on the pretext of their daily worship, while 
they actually feared for the arrival of Rishyasringa's father who may hurl curses on his arrival... 
[1-10-22]

Shlok 23: "After the departure of all them the courtesans, that Brahman Rishyasringa, the grandson of 
Sage Kaashyapa, is disturbed at heart and even behaved sadly... [1-10-23]

Shlok 24- 25a: "Then on the next day Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka and the prosperous sage with ascetic 
power has arrived at that place where he saw well-decorated and delightful courtesans recollecting 
in mind repetitively about them alone. [1-10-24, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26: " Then on seeing the arrival of that Brahman, the courtesans felt happy at heart, and all 
of those courtesans on surrounding him said, "oh, gentle one, welcome to the threshold of 
our hermitage... [1-10-25b, 26]

Shlok 27: "There are excellent tuber fruits and fruits and there will be a very distinctive hospitality... 
definitely indeed..." So said the courtesans.[1-10-27]

Shlok 28: "On hearing the heart-pleasing words of all those courtesans, Rishyasringa made up his mind 
to go over there, and then those women took him away [to their place in Anga Kingdom.] [1-10-28]

Shlok 29: "While that great soul ad Brahman Rishyasringa while being brought into Anga Kingdom, then 
the Rain-god quickly showered rain in Anga kingdom to the delight of the world. [1-10-29]

Shlok 30- 31: "The king Romapada personally proceeded towards that Brahman Rishyasring who is now 
entering Anga kingdom along with rains, made prostratiion before him, offered water 
customarily with dedication, and then the king Romapada besought beneficence 
of the best sage Rishyasringa to save him and his kingdom from the fury of his father Sage Vibhandaka, 
if sage Vibhandaka were to know about this pursuit of bringing Rishyasringa to Anga 
country, at a later time ... [1-10-30, 31]

[Commentary] The salutation in prostration on the ground is usually performed before Gods or Deities, in 
reverence. It is called saaSTaanga-praNaamam = sa aSTa anga praNaamam , i.e., saluting 
with eight body parts touching the ground, indicating his absolute surrender to the worshipped.

Shlok 32: "On entering the palace princess Shanta is given to Rishyasringa in customary marriage, and 
then that King Romapada obtained rejoice with a peaceful mind. [1-10-32]

Shlok 33: " Thus that great fulgent Rishyasringa lived in Anga kingdom along with his wife Shanta, and 
with all his desires fulfilled and also well worshipped" [Thus Sumantra said the legend of 
Rishyasringa to King Dasharatha.] [1-10-33]



SARGA 11
------------------------------

[Text] On the advice of his minister Sumantra, Dasharatha proceeds to Anga kingdom to 
			fetch Sage Rishyasringa and his wife Shanta to his capital Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: Minister Sumantra continued, "oh, the great king, I will further narrate all that has been 
said by Sanat Kumara, the best one among all deities, kindly listen to these favourable words." 
[1-11-1.]

[Commentary] Sage Sanat Kumara belongs to the bygone era of Ikshvaku dynasty. Please refer to the account 
regarding the era-system of ancient India at endnote.

Shlok 2: "A king named Dasharatha will be born into Ikshwaku dynasty who will be very virtuous, 
resplendent and truthful one to his vow." [Said Sanat Kumara, the Sage.] [1-11-2]

Shlok 3: "King Dasharatha will befriend the king of Anga and the king of Anga will beget a fortunate 
girl named Shanta. [1-11-3]

[Commentary] Shanta is said to be the daughter of Dasharatha and given to Romapada in adoption, and Rishyasringa 
marries her alone. This is what Sumantra says to Dasharatha at 1-9-19.

Shlok 4: The son of the king of Anga, the earlier king of Anga kingdom, will be known as Romapada, 
or also know as Chitraratha, and the highly renowned king Dasharatha approaches Romapada. 
[1-11-4]

Shlok 5: Then king Dasharatha says to king of Anga "oh, righteous one, I am childless and hence I intend 
to perform a Vedic ritual. Let the husband of your daughter Shanta, Sage Rishyasringa, preside 
over that Vedic ritual at you behest, for the sake of progeny in my dynasty. [1-11-5]

Shlok 6: "On hearing those words of king Dasharatha that benevolent soul Romapada, the king of Anga, 
considers heartily and agrees to send the one who endows progeny by rituals, namely Sage Rishyasringa 
his son-in-law. [1-11-6]

[Commentary] The words pradaasyate putravantam are read in some translations as 'Rishyasringa 
who already has a son...' while others read it as 'a sage who endows progeny by putrakameSTi
 ritual...' But in Maha Bharata father Vibhandaka says to Rishyasringa to comeback 
after begetting a son, which Rishyasringa did not concede. So taking this some say Rishyasringa 
has a son. But it is generally accepted that putravantam as aahitaagni, 
Vedic ritualist of eminence, according to: jaataputraH kR^ishNakesho 
agniin adhiita... according to shruti scripture.

Shlok 7: "On receiving that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, at the behest of his father-in-law, that king 
Dasharatha gets rid of his febrile condition and will accomplish that Vedic ritual, feeling 
very felicitous in the depths of his heart. [1-11-7]

Shlok 8-9: "That king, the desirer of performing vedic ritual, the knower of virtue and the lord of people, namely Dasharatha 
will be requesting that best Brahman Rishyasringa with his palms adjoined in supplication 
for the conduct of ritual, for progeny and even for his heavenly abodes, and that king of 
all the quarters of earth will accomplish those desires from that eminent Brahman Rishyasringa. 
[1-11-8,9]

[Commentary] Heavenly abodes are dependent on begetting sons: aputrasya gatirnaasti 
svargo naiva ca naiva ca There is no way out [in other worlds] for those without sons...
shruti scripture. Hence the request of Dasharatha is that way.

Shlok 10: "There will be four sons to king Dasharatha that abound with valour, enrich dynasty's reputation 
and they will be renowned among all beings." Thus said Sage Sanat Kumara to other sages. [1-11-10]

[Commentary] 'Sons and Paradise are intimately connected in Indian belief. A man desires above every thing 
to have a son to perpetuate his race, and to assist with sacrifices and funeral rites to make 
him worthy to obtain a lofty seat in heaven or to preserve that which he has already obtained.' 
Gorresio via Ralph T. H. Griffith [1870-1874].

Shlok 11: "This way he that ancient and godly Sage Sanatkumaara, who is also Brahma's brain-child like 
Narada, said this legend in earlier Divine Era, called krita yuga..." thus Sumantra continued 
his narration to Dasharatha. [1-11-11]

[Commentary] Please refer endnote for yuga / era classification.

Shlok 12: " Oh, great king the tigerly-man, he that Sage Rishyasringa be led here on your proceeding 
in person with staff and transport and on adoring him well personally." Thus Sumantra concluded 
his narration. [1-11-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: On hearing the word of advise from charioteer, Dasharatha became gladsome and made Sumantra 
to reiterate to that sage also, for his approval, then Dasharatha travelled to the place where 
that Brahman Rishyasringa is, along with the inmates of palace-chambers and ministers too. 
[1-11-13, 14a]

[Commentary] While the chief priest Vashishta is officiator of all rituals no king can invite another priest 
to perform something without the consent of the officiating priest. Hence the consent of Vasishta 
is obtained, after asking Sumantra to reiterate what all was said, to sage Vashishta also.

Shlok 14b- 15a: On crossing over the rivers and forests slowly and steadily Dasharatha entered that kingdom 
where that eminent Brahman is there. [1-11-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Then Dasharatha saw that best Brahman who he is nearby king Romapada, and who is resplendent 
like ritual fire. [1-11-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then king Romapada gladdened at heart of hearts paid excellent respects to king Dasharatha 
procedurally and in view of their friendship.[1-11-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Then Romapada informed the wise sage Rishyasringa about the friendship and relation with Dasharatha, 
and then that sage worshipped king Dasharatha in his return. [1-11-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Thus well received by king Romapada, king Dasharatha spent seven to eight days with him, and 
then spoke this to king Romapada. [1-11-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Oh, lord of subjects, your daughter Princess Shanta may go over my city Ayodhya along with 
her husband Rishyasringa, as oh, king, I am contemplating to perform a great Vedic ritual, 
indeed." So said Dasharatha to Romapada. [1-11-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "So it shall be" said king Romapada agreeing to their travel with king Dasharatha, and addressed 
these words to that Brahman sage and his son-in-law, Sage Rishyasringa "You may proceed along 
with your wife." [1-11-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] Here Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation [1870-1874] has that Shanta is the daughter of Dasharatha: 
'This king,' he said, 'from days of old / A well beloved friend I hold. / To me this pearl 
of dames he gave / From childless woe mine age to save, / The daughter whom he loved so much, 
/ Moved by compassion's gentle touch. / In him thy S'anta's father see: / As I am even so 
is he...

Shlok 21b- 22a: Then Rishyasringa agreed and replied to the king Romapada "So it will be done" and then having 
been permitted by the king he set forth along with his wife. [1-11-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Those valiant kings greeted each other with thanksgiving palm-fold, and in friendship they 
embraced each other and gladdened. [1-11-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: Then king Dasharatha who set forth to Ayodhya bade farewell to his friend king Romapada, and 
he firstly sent quick-footed messengers to Ayodhya to inform his citizens about his arrival 
along with Sage Rishyasringa. [1-11-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "Let the entire city of Ayodhya be well decorated very quickly, let her streets be sprinkled 
with water and then swept, let the flags of welcome be hoisted.." Thus, king Dasharatha ordered 
messengers that are sent beforehand. [1-11-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: Then on hearing the arrival of their king all the citizens felt very happy and readily performed 
all those works exactly as ordered by their king. [1-11-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Then king Dasharatha keeping Rishyasringa before him entered the well-decorated city Ayodhya 
amidst the full sounding of conch shells and drumbeats. [1-11-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28: Then all the citizens are very happy on seeing that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, who is well 
honoured and being entered into the city by their king Dasharatha, as has been done once by 
Indra when he entered sage Kashyapa's son Vamana, the dwarfish boy and the incarnation of 
Vishnu, into heavens, and thus those citizens felt that their human lord Dasharatha vies with 
divine lord Indra. [1-11-27b, 28]

[Commentary] The simile of Indra to king Dasharatha is in two ways. Dasharatha ruled kingdom like Indra 
who rules Heavens. The word Indra karmaNa also refers to the deeds of Dasharatha, 
in helping the gods' forces combating the demonic forces. Thus the deeds performed by Dasharatha 
are like those of Indra's. Here Dasharatha is bringing Sage Rishyasringa to Ayodhya. Earlier 
Indra led Vamana, the dwarf-boy to heavens. Vamana is the incarnation of Vishnu in early ages 
and after Vamana suppressed Bali, the Emperor to netherworlds, Indra took Vamana to heavens. 
Thus Dasharatha is like Indra on earth, both by his virtue and deed. Incidentally, Vamana 
i.e., Vishnu, is the son-incarnate to Sage Kaashyapa, while sage Rishyasringa is the grandson 
of the same Kaashyapa. Thus Sage Kaashyapa is instrumental to these two incarnations. Through 
the divine grace of Sage Rishyasringa, the same Vishnu is going to take birth as Rama, while 
Sage Kashyapa is a grandparent of Rama in this era, and while he alone was Vishnu's father 
when Vishnu incarnated as Dwarf boy Vamana.

Shlok 29: Dasharatha entered the sage into the palace chambers and worshipped him there as ordained 
in the scriptures, and in bringing the Sage here into his country, king Dasharatha believed 
that his desired is fulfilled. [1-11-28]

Shlok 30: On seeing her, the broad-eyed Shanta, who came there along with her husband all the ladies 
of palace derived happiness for the homecoming of their own daughter, as it were. [1-11-29]

Shlok 31: Shanta thus being admired by all of them, and in an exceptional manner by Dasharatha, comfortably 
resided there along with her husband, the Vedic scholar Rishyasringa. [1-11-31]

[Commentary] The Riwik is not just a reciter of Veda-s but more a director or conductor of whole orchestration 
of the Vedic ritual, which involves lots of rules, in reciting hymns, in performing deeds 
and all in their exactness. The whole lots of works that need be performed have the order 
of precedence like prime, auxiliary or adjunctive in their ordinance. A Ritwik is the elated 
scholar who keeps track of these activities while other scholars recite hymns as directed 
by these Ritwik-s. Hence, Ritwik-hood is the highest.

[Commentary] One cycle of the above four eras is called one 
mahaa yuga and seventy-one [71] of such of the Fourfold Eras mahaa yugaa-s will become 
one manvantara, Manu-Epoch, the time scale attributed to one Manu, the Supreme Ruler of 
Mankind. There are total fourteen such Manu-epochs and six of them over in the present 
manvantara , the time-scale.

[Commentary] The completed Manu cycles are 1.] 
svayambhu manu , 2.] svaarochiSa manu , 3.] auttami manu , 4.] taamasa 
manu , 5.] raivata manu , 6.] chaaksha manu . Presently we are in the Seventh 
cycle called vaivasvata mnavantara , and there are seven more manvantara -s to 
come, starting with 8.] surya saavarni Manu, 9.] dharma saavarni, 10.] daksha 
savarni, 11.] rudra saavarni, 12.] brahma saavrani, 13.] rouchya manu 
, 14.] bhoutya manu.

[Commentary] Such fourteen Manu time cycles will be said to 
be a Day of Brahma, the Absolute. Ramayana is said to have happened in kR^ita yuga, the 
second Manu time cycle. The earlier one is satya yuga , in which the ancestors of Rama, 
descendants of Raghu dynasty, like Saagara, Harishchandra et al, were the rulers, which is called 
Ikshvaku dynasty.

King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the sages indent paraphernalia, 
which the ministers are ordered to supply forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 
8, excepting the inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha desired to perform the Vedic 
ritual. [1-12-1]

[Commentary] Please refer to endnote for Indian seasons and months for vasanta / spring season.

Shlok 2: Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is like that of a deity, King 
Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny 
to maintaining his family line. [1-12-2]

Shlok 3: Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to the king, "So it shall be, let the 
paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative and 
let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." [1-12-3]

Shlok 4- 5- 6a: Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, "Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors 
like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well 
as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly..." [1-12-4, 5, 6a]

Shlok 6- 7- 8a: Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic scholars and clergymen. 
Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due worships to all the sages and saints brought in 
by Sumantra, uttered these words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner. [1-12-6, 
7, 8a]

Shlok 8- 9- 10a: "My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am thinking of performing the 
Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by 
strict observances... I wish to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage's 
son, Rishyasringa... [1-12-8, 9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: Then "Splendid, splendid is this idea," said the Brahmana scholars blessing the king. Then Sage Vashishta 
along with all other important personalities have applauded the idea that has come out of the king's 
voice, and all those Vedic scholars and clerj~nmen keeping Rishyasringa at helm of affairs said this 
to the king, in appreciation of that idea. [1-12-10b, 11]

Shlok 12- 13: "Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come to you, you will by all 
means get four sons with boundless valour... let ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse 
be released and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River...." 
The Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. [1-12-12, 13]

Shlok 14: Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, and he spoke to the other 
ministers of his court, with happiness derived from those good words. [1-12-14]

Shlok 15-16-17-18- 19: The king said to his executives, "As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the paraphernalia for my ritual 
be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let 
religious teachers follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the northern 
banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and prospering throughout as ordained 
in the scriptures and tradition... all the kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, 
if only they can perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult ritual... the 
Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the rituals whereat they can inteject themselves 
in to the proceedings of the ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also 
gets ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be conducted faultlessly 
till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the scriptures... since all of you assembled here 
are efficient ones in conducting such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... 
[1-12-15,16,17,18, 19]

Shlok 20: In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying "it will be done accordingly..." 
and indeed they have faultlessly carried out works as ordered. [1-12-20]

Shlok 21: Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is like a Sacred Bull among the kings for 
his virtuous endeavour of undertaking the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned 
from there as they have come. [1-12-21]

Shlok 22: On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those ministers who are still available 
there for further orders from the king, and then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. 
[1-12-22]



The Indian yearly time-cycle is two-kind, one on northern solstice and the other southern solstice. 
And seasons are twelve and every two months is a season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing 
on the stars position every year. They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below:



SARGA 13
------------------------------



King Dasharatha requests Sage Vashishta, the Royal Priest to commence works for the Vedic 
ritual. Sage Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline to be observed in 
executing the works. Sage Vashishta also instructs the minister Sumantra to invite various 
kings of other countries, and those kings will be received with great hospitality. King Dasharatha 
along with his wives takes ritual vow and enters ritual hall.

Shlok 1: On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined 
one to beget progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall. [1-13-1]

[Commentary] The performer of such Vedic rituals has to perform preliminary rituals for a period of one 
year in order to attain eligibility to perform the final one. Here Dasharatha is said to have 
completed such preludes as he entering into the Vedic ritual hall in the springtime of the 
succeeding year to the one referred in last chapter.

Shlok 2: Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble 
words to him. [1-13-2]

Shlok 3: "Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such 
a way that no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions. [1-13-3]

Shlok 4: "You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly and kind-hearted to me, and you alone 
shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good faith and credence. [1-13-4]

Shlok 5: Then that reverent Brahman Vashishta said to king, "Whatever that is requested or decided 
by you, I will see that all of them are materialised accordingly. [1-13-5]

Shlok 6-7-8-9: Then Sage Vashishta then summoned and spoke to elderly Brahman scholars, and elderly architects 
who are all proficient and elderly experts in conducting the construction of the ritual hall 
etc. Then summoned are the construction supervisors, brick-makers, carpenters, earth-diggers, 
accountants, and sculptors. So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars 
in scriptures and those men who are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them 
saying, "Performance of the ritual be organised by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands 
be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, 
with very many facilities included in them. [1-13-6,7,8,9]

[Commentary] A detailed description of the components of Vedic ritual hall is given at the endnote of next 
chapter, wherein King Dasharatha enters. Vedic ritual cannot be performed in ordinary households 
or in small temples. A very large place is selected, as per architectural science, and at 
its centre a homa-kunda, an altar of fire will be constructed. This area will not 
have any roofing so as to let the vapours of oblations of ghee, sandalwood paste and others 
offered into the fire of altar, get into the atmosphere and thereby to Heavens. Around this 
altar of fire, huge sheds will be constructed to accommodate thousands of participants and 
onlookers. Apart from this, mammoth kitchens and dining halls are to be constructed as all 
of the thousands of participants, who are to be fed as long as ritual is conducted. Some of 
the many tradesmen are listed in a bird's eye view as above.

Shlok 10: "Like that, for accommodating Brahmans hundreds of sanctified houses be built, well endowed 
and well established with very many eatables, foods, and potables. [1-13-10]

Shlok 11: "So also, accommodation is to be given for city dwellers too, in very spacious housing, and 
severally for the kings arriving from distant places.[1-13-11]

Shlok 12: "For horses stables, reposing stalls for elephants, like that great billets for soldiers may 
be built for those foreign-country dwellers arriving in here on their horses and elephants 
along with their soldiers. [1-13-12]

Shlok 13: "These lodgings are to be arranged with many foods and utilities for the people of this city 
and for others coming from distant countries, and a very grand food be given in all of them. 
[1-13-13]

Shlok 14- 15a: "Food is to be given dutifully treating all of them well but not just illusively, and the 
people of all the castes shall be well honoured as they would get their due respect, and no 
disrespect be shown, even when overcome by passion or anger at anyone. [1-13-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16: "Exceptionally respectable are those men and architects that are preoccupied in the works 
of the ritual as they deserve, and those men involved in these works shall be well-treated 
with funds and food. [1-13-15b, 16]

Shlok 17: "Thus, as to how all this be well organised without least negligence, thus you all shall administer 
in all your cooperation and good spirit." Thus Sage Vashishta spoke to the organisers. [1-13-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: Then all of them collectively replied to Sage Vashishta "As desired, all the well ordered 
works will not be neglected in the least, and they will be done as ordered, and not the least 
of them will be slighted." So said the artisans to Sage Vashishta. [1-13-18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20- 21a: "Then on calling for Sumantra, Sage Vashishta said these words to him, "Let all those kings 
of the earth that are righteous be invited, and let all the people from all the kingdoms, 
say Brahmans, Kshatriya-s, Vaisya-s, Shudra-s be invited in scores duly honouring them." So 
said Vashishta to Sumantra. [1-13-19b, 20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: "You personally invite Janaka the king of Mithila, a valiant one and an advocate of truth, 
honouring his well and duly bearing in mind that he is a long-time associate of our King Dasharatha, 
hence I am telling you in the first instance. [1-13-21b,22]

Shlok 23: "Thus that King of Kaashi who is always a friendly, affectionate and a cordial one, indeed 
he shall be invited by you personally. [1-13-23]

Shlok 24: "Likewise, King of Kekaya, an elderly, very virtuous, and also the father-in-law of our Lion-King 
Dasharatha, you personally invite him along with his sons. [1-13-24]

Shlok 25: "Romapada, the lord of Anga kingdom and the user of great bow, let that illustrious one be 
invited well honoured, for he is the friend of our lion-king Dasharatha. [1-13-25]

Shlok 26: "Like that King of Kosala namely Bhanumanta, and the King of Magadha, a brave one and a profound 
one in all scriptural knowledge, let them be honoured well and be invited. [1-13-26]

Shlok 27: "And Praaptijna, the king of Magadha, the kind-hearted and best one among kings, be well honoured 
and invited. Further, taking the orders of King Dasharatha and motivated by those orders, 
the kings of Sindhu, Sauviira and Sauraastra kingdoms may also be invited. [1-13-27]

Shlok 28- 29: "All of the kings of southern kingdoms be invited, and should there be any other friends and 
other friendly kings on the surface of the earth, they too shall be invited as early as possible 
with all their followers, relatives through highly illustrious envoys, of course with the 
orders of our king." Thus Sage Vashishta said to minister Sumantra. [1-13-28, 29]

Shlok 30: On hearing that word of Vashishta, Sumantra expeditiously ordered devout envoys to invite 
all those kings to their kingdom. [1-13-30]

Shlok 31: That virtuous Sumantra became brisk upon sage's words and personally journeyed to fetch all 
the rulers on the earth. [1-13-31]

Shlok 32: All those artisans engaged in ritual works have reported Vashishta, the details of all those 
ritual works that are accomplished. [1-13-32]

Shlok 33- 34a: Then, that satisfied saint and eminent Brahman Vashishta, spoke this way to all of them, "nothing 
is to be endowed to anyone either with disrespect or deceptively, the deeds done with disrespect 
will kill the donor and there is no doubt about it." [1-13-33, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: Then in some days and nights many kings have arrived taking precious gems with them as gifts 
for Dasharatha. [1-13-34b, 35a]

Shlok 35b- 36: Then the well pleased Sage Vashishta said this to King Dasharatha "the kings from distant 
kingdoms have arrived at your behest, oh, tigerly-man, and these best kings are well honoured 
by me also as per their status. [1-13-35b, 36]

Shlok 37: "All the ritual works are also completed by the well coalescent men, thus you may start towards 
the ritual place that is nearby, to perform your ritual." Said Sage Vashishta to King Dasharatha. 
[1-13-37]

Shlok 38: "All the desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt 
of you see ritual hall that is as though built by your mere wish. [1-13-38]

Shlok 39: Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth 
towards the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa. 
[1-13-39]

[Commentary] In undertaking of auspicious works, Hindus watch out for date, day, and the star of the day, 
called tithi, vaara, nakshatra in accordance with astrological import. In addition 
to these three are two more yoga and karaNa , which when added together 
this becomes panchaanga, five-aspects of time, which are essential to verify before 
conducting any auspicious work.

Shlok 40: Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them 
entered the ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus. [1-13-40]

Shlok 41: When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha 
along with his wives undertook vow of ritual. [1-13-41]



SARGA 14
------------------------------



The Horse Ritual of Emperor Dasharatha is started on the banks of Sarayu River. The details 
of the arrangements for the participants, and visitors along with some aspects of the Vedic 
Ritual are narrated.

Shlok 1: Then after completion of one year and on regaining the ritual horse, the Emperor Dasharatha 
commenced his Vedic Ritual on the northern banks of River Sarayu. [1-14-1]

[Commentary] In ashwamedha-yaga , a well-decorated horse will be let out with an insignia on its 
forehead challenging any king to capture it and face the wrath of releasing king. If any one 
captures the horse, he shall be strong enough to incite a war. Otherwise, the valour and invincibility 
of releasing king are well established and he may proceed with the ritual proper. Now that 
the ritual horse released during last year by King Dasharatha has come back without being 
captured by anyone, thus establishing the invincibility of King Dasharatha, as such he can 
commence the ritual proper.

Shlok 2: Keeping Rishyasringa at the helm of affairs those eminent Brahmans commenced, ashva-medha 
, the Horse-ritual of that noble-souled Dasharatha. [1-14-2]

Shlok 3: Those well-versed conductors of Vedic rituals called ritviks , have started to perform 
works relating to ritual as per canon and rules, and conducted them scripturally and customarily. 
[1-14-3]

Shlok 4: On performing pravargya ritual as per scriptures, like that upasada ritual 
too, those Brahmans have customarily performed all of those other rituals incidental to the 
main one scripturally. [1-14-4]

Shlok 5: Then all of those distinguished sages are contended with what they have performed by worshipping 
gods already summoned, they also conducted early morning savana ritual and its ancillaries 
as enjoined. [1-14-5]

Shlok 6: The oblations addressed to Indra are well given as ordained, and the flawless king Dasharatha 
also crushed the Soma creeper to squeeze Soma juice, and thus the mid-day savana 
ritual has come to pass according to sequence. [1-14-6]

[Commentary] Soma creeper is from Sacrostemma Brevistigma of Asclepiadacea family and some other scholars 
hold the view that it is from Sarcostema Viminalis family.

Shlok 7: Like that those proficient Brahmans have also performed the third savana , ritual 
of that great-exalted soul Dasharatha according to the viewpoint of scriptures. [1-14-7]

Shlok 8: Rishyasringa and other best scholars with their well lettered and intonated Vedic hymns have 
invoked Indra and other gods to that place. [1-14-8]

Shlok 9: The hotaa -s, invocators, have welcomed the celestials for partaking oblations by 
singing saama Veda hymns sweetly and harmoniously, and on inviting them with Vedic 
hymns they have offered oblations to them. [1-14-9]

Shlok 10: There is no unburnt oblation resulted in that fire-ritual nor even a small mishap slipped 
in the performance of ritual. Everything appeared canonically correct and hymn oriented. Indeed 
the ritual is performed in a secure way. [1-14-10]

Shlok 11: In these days of ritual none found there to be weary or hungry, and there is no single unscholarly 
person, nor any Brahman without at least a hundred apprentices. [1-14-11]

Shlok 12: Given anytime the Brahmans, servants, sages, and pilgrims are fed with food for their arrival 
at the place of boarding is unpredictable, and that arrival is dependent on their duties for 
Brahmans, and by their masters for servants, and for pilgrims that do not have a particular 
time of arrival or departure. [1-14-12]

[Commentary] Some scholars tend to conclude that Ramayana might have been written in post Buddhist period 
by finding the words like shramaNa etc., the famous wandering Buddhist monk sect. 
The word shramaNa in Sanskrit means only a pilgrim, and pilgrimage is an ordained 
aspect of salvation as per Indra is the friend of traveller. Therefore wander - aitareya 
brahmaNa [VII.33.3] The Buddhist shramaNa -s are the wandering monks in search 
of converts whereas Hindu shramana-s are pure sanyasi-s wandering for their 
own salvation.

Shlok 13: Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, no satisfaction 
to complete the meal is attained for themselves, as the food served is that pleasant.



Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, there is no satisfaction 
to Emperor Dasharatha, for it appeared to be too meagre a serving and a lot more is to be 
served. [1-14-13]

Shlok 14: "Food be given abundantly, clothing be given variously" are the directives, accordingly the 
king's men have distributed numerously there at the ritual place. [1-14-14]

Shlok 15: Heaps of foodstuffs are also appearing there, many of them and mountain similar, which is 
made available customarily, day after day. [1-14-15]

Shlok 16: To that ritual of that great-souled Dasharatha masses of men and women have arrived from different 
countries, and they are all well-pleased with the sumptuous food and drink supplied. [1-14-16]

Shlok 17: "The eminent Brahmans have appreciated the food that is prepared by perfect cooking to be 
relishable, and it is heard as they said, "oh, Raghava, blessed are you for we are satisfied..." 
[1-14-17]

Shlok 18: Well-decorated men have served food to Brahmans, while others who wore gem-studded and lustrous 
earrings have helped them. [1-14-18]

Shlok 19: Those eminent Brahmans that are good debaters have debated many intellectual debates to defeat 
each other, during the gap-periods of ritual works. [1-14-19]

Shlok 20: Day by day those expert Brahmans have performed all ritual works as encouraged by Vashishta, 
and others and as contained in scriptures. [1-14-20]

Shlok 21: There is no scholar without the knowledge of the six branches of Vedas, none who is an unavowed 
scholar, none who heard learnt less scriptures, and none among the members of the ritual of 
that king Dasharatha is an inexpert in debating, thus all are scholarly Brahmans. [1-14-21]

[Commentary] The six branches of Veda-s are: 1] shikSaa - phonetics, 2] vyaakaraNa - grammar, 
3] chandas - prosody, 4] nirukta - etymology, 5] jyoutiSha - astronomy, 
6] kalpa - ritual acts.

Shlok 22-23: When the time came to stake wooden ritual posts, six posts of bilwa wood, six posts of khadira 
wood, and further the same number of posts of parnina wood are staked. One post of sleshmaataka 
wood and two of devadaaru wood as stipulated are staked. Then the distance between each post 
is maintained at the length of extended arms. [1-14-22,23]

Shlok 24: All of those the posts are made by the authorities on scriptures and ritual scholars, and 
they are gold-pleated and decorated for the purpose of elegance to that ritual. [1-14-24]

Shlok 25: They are altogether twenty-one posts, each post is twenty-one cubits in height, and each is 
decoratively clothed with each cloth. [1-14-25]

Shlok 26: Carpenters have carved all the posts well, and built them strongly with octahedral surfaces 
that are smoothened, and thereby they are implanted procedurally. [1-14-26]

Shlok 27: Those posts draped in cloths and worshipped with flowers and perfumery are irradiant, and 
they shone forth like the constellation of Seven Sages in the sky. [1-14-27]

[Commentary] The Seven Sages is the constellation of stars in the Ursa Major - The Great Bear, and is called
sapta R^ishimaNDala . The Indian names of the Seven Sages are 1] atri , 
2] angiirasa , 3] pulastya , 4] pulaha , 5] kratu , 6]
mariichi , 7] vashiSTha .

Shlok 28: The bricks for Altar of Fire are well designed and made according to rules and standard measurements. 
The Brahmans who are experts in the architecture of laying Fire Altar, by calculating the 
ritual field with a one-ply rope and decide where and how the that shall be, the Altar of 
Fire is layered well with bricks in that ritual. [1-14-28]

[Commentary] The construction of Fire Altar itself is a ritual, called iSTikaa-chayana , where 
each brick is to be consecrated with hymns. On completion of the layering of bricks to the 
required shape, i.e., that of an eagle-like platform for a garuDayaj~na-vedi etc., 
then Holy head bath abhiSeka is performed to the brick-work of the Altar by pouring 
milk and other sacred liquids to the chanting of Vedic hymns.

Shlok 29: That Altar of Fire of that King, the Lion, is layered by expert Brahmans in the shape of an 
eagle with golden wings, with its size being three folds bigger than the altars of other rituals, 
thus it has eighteen separators, and fire is laid on it. [1-14-29]

[Commentary] The garuDa , the Divine Eagle is the vehicle of Vishnu with an all-pervading vision 
and fastest wings. He is the only one who once brought amrita, the Divine Elixir, for the 
release of his mother from slavery. Hence, the Altar of Fire is given the shape of this Divine 
Eagle, with its wings and tail outstretched, head turned downward, and the eyes looking eastward.
yaj~na is also termed as suparNa i.e., su good, parNa 
winged; carrier of the oblations with his golden wings to heavens. Or its wings are glittering 
with gold sahasram hiraNyashakalaiH pratidinam agnim prokShati - shruti 
meaning every day with thousands of gold chips oblate the fire... scriptures say 
so. So the Altar of fire is glittering with thousands of gold chips sprinkled every day. This 
altar is laid threefold bigger than the usual one.

Shlok 30: In that ritual animals, serpents and birds designated to such and such deities are readied 
according to the scriptural directives. [1-14-30]

Shlok 31: The sages have arranged those animals that are to be there in animal sacrifices, like horse 
and other aquatic animals, in that ritual according to scriptures. [1-14-31]

[Commentary] Many animals are sacrificed in Horse ritual. But they will be segregated as forest animals 
and village animals. In them many of the forest animals will be let off by taking them round 
the fire on to their right in salutation to fire, agnipradakShiNa-namaskaara. The 
animals pertaining to village will be sacrificed in ritual. Hence it is up to the priests 
to decide which is to be retained or let off.

Shlok 32: Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse 
of that King Dasharatha. [1-14-32]

Shlok 33: With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, 
and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. [1-14-33]

[Commentary] Here Kausalya did not butcher the horse as queens do not butcher animals in rituals, but the 
horse is already sacrificed. It is a symbolical act of queens to pierce with three golden 
knives like needles. The scripture says that all the eligible wives of the performer of ritual 
have to pierce that way. sauvarNiibhi suuciibhiH patnayaH ashvasya asipathaan 
kalayanti - shruti / scripture. So all the three queens have performed that symbolic 
act by piercing that horse, which is already dead, with golden needle-like knives. Govindaraja.

Shlok 34: Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse 
that flew away like a bird. [1-14-34]

Shlok 35: Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely hotaa adhwaryu and udgaataa 
have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the 
king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king. [1-14-35]

[Commentary] There will be four officiating priests for these Vedic rituals. 1. brahmaa , 2.
hotaa , 3. adhvaryu , 4. udgaataa , to whom the king has to donate 
his inner core properties like wives, lands etc. By practice a king has to marry four wives. 
The four women of the king are 1. mahiSi = Queen, 2. parivR^itti = neglected 
women, 3. vaavaata = concubine, 4. paalaakali = goblet-maid. The order of 
donation is that the Queen to brahmaa , concubine to hotaa , neglected woman 
to udgaataa , and the goblet-maid to the adhwaryu . Here, though the 
brahma ritvik is not cited along with paalaakali, goblet-maid, they are implied. 
The donation is symbolic and later bartering with some valuable items that is redeemed. Govindaraja. 
There is another way of translating this. For the wording, hastena samayojayan the 
priests took these wives by hand to bring them in contact with the dead horse.

Shlok 36: Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum 
[fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to 
bake as a food to the celestials. [1-14-36]

[Commentary] Some more scholars give a non-violent touch to this act and they say that a medicinal plant 
,is offered in altar and its smell is smelt. That plant is substituted for omentum of the 
horse, and the wording is read differently. When the sequence is running on horse and horse's 
body parts how a medical plant is brought in, is unclear. And some say that a horse will not 
have omentum according to Vedic texts.

Shlok 37: The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own 
sin. [1-14-37]

Shlok 38: Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally 
oblated all of them into fire. [1-14-38]

Shlok 39: In other rituals the oblations will be offered into sacrificial fire with spoon-like sticks 
of plaksha tree, but in Horse-sacrifice ritual they are offered through the vetasa creeper, 
a rattan plant, cane. [1-14-39]

Shlok 40: The Horse Ritual is to be performed for three days as laid down in kalpasutra-s, 
the rules governing such rituals, and by braahmaNa-s, the penultimate parts of Veda-s, 
and the one performed on the first day is called chatuSToma ritual. [1-14-40]

Shlok 41: The ritual on the second day is called ukthyam , and the next one performed on third 
day is called atiraatra. These apart many of the preordained rituals are performed 
there in that ritual as envisaged in scriptures. [1-14-41]

[Commentary] The horse-ritual is conducted only for three days. But Dasharatha got it performed with more 
variously connected rituals, in all his eagerness to appease gods for progeny.

Shlok 42: The rituals called jyothiSToma, aayuSi, and atiraatra rituals are performed. 
And also rituals of great kind like abhijit, vishwajit, aptoryaama are performed. 
[1-14-42]

Shlok 43-44: As the promoter of his own dynasty that king Dasharatha donated eastern side to hotaa, 
western to adhvaryu, and southern to brahmaa. And to udgaataa northern 
side is given in donation. These were the donations stipulated in that great ritual, ashwamedha, 
by the Self-Created Brahma from earlier times. [1-14-44,43]

Shlok 45: On completing the ritual thus that best man Dasharatha justifiably donated those lands to 
the officiating priests, called ritwiks, to promote his dynasty. [1-14-45]

Shlok 46: Thus on giving away the vast expanses of his kingdom he that glorious one born in Ikshvaku 
dynasty is gladdened, but all the officiating priests said to the king who by now is rid of 
his sins. [1-14-46]

Shlok 47: "You alone are capable to protect the earth in its entirety, and there is no use for us with 
these lands, and we are not capable to rule it, either." Thus the priests are addressing the 
king. [1-14-47]

Shlok 48: "We are always preoccupied with self-study and teaching of scriptures, oh, king, thus you 
may give us something else in barter, any modest thing. " [1-14-48]

Shlok 49: "Let best gems, gold, or cows or anything else that is available you may give us, what is 
the use of these vast expanses to us." So said the scholars. [1-14-49]

Shlok 50- 51a: The king Dasharatha, the lord of people, thus requested by the scholarly Vedic Brahmans gave 
them millions of cows, ten of ten million gold coins, and the silver four times thereof. [1-14-50, 
51a]

[Commentary] Silver is prohibited for donation in such rituals, but here it is being given as barter for 
the lands earlier donated, hence it is an acceptable item.

Shlok 51b- 52a: Then all those officiating priests collectively gave that wealth to sage Rishyasringa and 
to the enlightened sage Vashishta. [1-14-51b, 52a]

Shlok 52b- 53a: Then all of those Brahmans are well satisfied at heart and distributed among themselves the 
wealth passed on by Rishyasringa and Vashishta, and then they said, "We are highly gladdened." 
[1-14-52a, 53a]

Shlok 53b- 54a: Then to the other Brahmans who arrived there to see the ritual, King Dasharatha sincerly donated 
ten million gold coins. [1-14-53b, 54a]

Shlok 54b- 55a: That descendent of Raghava dynasty gave an excellent hand ornament to someone who is an impoverished 
Brahman and who is beseeching. [1-14-54a, 55a]

Shlok 55b- 56a: While those Brahmans are becoming happy then that king and the patron of Brahmans venerated 
them dutifully with his senses fluttering with happiness. [1-14-55b, 56a]

Shlok 56b- 57a: Then that benevolent and valiant King Dasharatha prostrated on ground venerating the Brahmans, 
and the Brahmans too chanted various blessing hymns on that prostrating king. [1-14-56b, 57a]

[Commentary] The blessings are also Vedic hymns and particular parts of Vedic hymns are chanted for particular 
occasion called aashiirwachana hymns. To date this practice is continued where a 
Brahmin priest is commissioned to perform even a domestic ritual. In effect, it shall be construed 
that these are not the blessings of the Brahmin priests who are chanting, but it is the blessing 
of Veda itself.

Shlok 57b- 58a: Then that king is gladdened at heart for the successful achievement of the completion of that 
excellent ritual that removes sin and that leads to heaven as well, and that which cannot 
be undertaken by many of the best kings. [1-14-57b, 58a]

Shlok 58b- 59a: Thereafter king Dasharatha said to sage Rishyasringa thus, "oh, sage with best vows, you alone 
are eligible to perform the ritual for the expansion of my dynasty." [1-14-58b, 59a]

Shlok 59b: That best Brahman Rishyasringa saying yes to the proposal, said this to king Dasharatha, "oh, 
king, there will be four sons to you that ennoble your dynasty. [1-14-59b, c]

Shlok 60: On hearing the sweet words of Sage Rishyasringa, he that king of kings Dasharatha went into 
a state of ecstasy and venerating that great soul, Rishyasringa, again said this to him. [1-14-60]



SARGA 15
------------------------------



King Dasharatha commences the putrakaameSTi ritual aiming to beget progeny, under 
the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings gather to receive the oblations offered 
in the Horse Ritual conducted by King Dasharatha. They are perturbed at the atrocities of 
Ravana, and request Brahma to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu arrives there and 
pacifies Brahma and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate as human to 
eliminate Ravana.

Shlok 1: That intellectual sage and one proficient in Veda-s Rishyasringa contemplated for a while, 
and gaining indications as to which ritual is to be performed, then said the king. [1-15-1]

Shlok 2: "I will procedurally conduct the ritual contained in the preamble of atharva-veda 
with procedural hymns, called <<em>>putra kaameSTi i.e., the ritual that bestows sons, for 
your benefit." [1-15-2]

Shlok 3: Then that resplendent Sage Rishyasringa commenced that putrakaameSTi ritual, offering 
oblations into sacred fire with ritual acts meticulously contained in hymns. [1-15-3]

Shlok 4: Then the deities along with celestial beings, siddha-s, i.e., the souls that obtained salvation, 
and also other esteemed sages who by now are the residents of Heavens have duteously assembled 
in the firmament to receive their part of the oblations. [1-15-4]

[Commentary] These celestial beings having attained salvation and living in their heavenly abodes do not 
re-enter these mortal worlds. They assemble in their cosmic zone, up above the Fire Altar 
of the Vedic ritual whenever a yajna is conducted on earth, to receive oblations.

Shlok 5: Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, 
the creator of worlds. [1-15-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh! God, the demon named Ravana is torturing all of us with his intrepidity, as you have 
blessed him, and we are unable to control him. [1-15-6]

Shlok 7: "You have given boon to him appreciating his ascesis and oh, god, with high regard to that 
boon of yours we are tolerating all the cruel acts of Ravana from then onwards [1-15-7]

[Commentary] Hindu mythology has no devils, but has only raakshasa -s, who can hardly be called 
demons, either. Not all the raakshasa-s are evil-doers. Some of the raakshasa-s are the fallen 
angels who take birth as mortals. They have their Vedic education, and they perform Vedic 
rituals and penance etc., thereby they get the patronage of any one of the gods among the 
Hindu Trinity, viz., Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. On attaining the cherished boons, they suddenly 
revolt against their own patron deities and commence the atrocities only to conquer the Heavens, 
knowing well that they cannot be attained with a mortal body. In order to snub the upsurge 
of such violence or the unnatural ascension to Heaven, the deity who gave the boons seeks 
the help of any of the other two of the Trinity. Then one from the Trinity will take birth 
as mortal, as an incarnation of god on earth. Usually Vishnu incarnates himself to eradicate 
the evils created by the intrepid raakshasa-s.

[Commentary] Here the celestials bring in a preamble for Vishnu's incarnation as Rama and thus the topic 
of Ravana occurs in this chapter of Ramayana. Ravana need not be taken as an evil spirit, 
devil, hobgoblin or a monstrous being. He is said to be a Brahman well versed in all Vedas, 
musicologist, and a great king of Lanka, with unlimited riches, and very many of his clansmen 
with their vast dominions, and what not. Though Brahma and Shiva bless Ravana with boons, 
Ravana flouts all the norms in conquering Heavens in which course he did not hesitate to torture 
anyone who becomes his personal hurdle or hindrance. Hence it is inevitable for the Trinity 
to curb Ravana's atrocities, and Vishnu will now be requested by all the deities to incarnate 
himself on earth. As such, the expression of the word "DEMON" may not always be taken as an 
ugly and monstrous looking devil or Satan, as per the usual religious conceptualisation of 
evil.

[Commentary] In Hinduism evil is not a separate entity from humans, but available in the same personification 
and resides along with virtue, like the two sides of a coin. These raakshasa-s are also mortals, 
extraordinary beings with extraordinary powers like god incarnates. But, with wickedness in 
their will, monstrosity in mind and a conqueror's ambition in their heart, they are rendered 
themselves as demons.

Shlok 8: "That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities 
of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of 
universe. [1-15-8]

[Commentary] There are eight functionary gods for cosmos in Hindu mythology that keep the cycle of natural 
law going. Each one is assigned with each of the eight sides of the universe along with a 
natural function. They are: 1] Indra, Heaven : East, 2] agni Fire-god : 
southeast, 3] yama Death-god : South, 4] naiR^iti Demon-god : southwest, 
5] varuNa Rain-god : west, 6] vaayu Air-god : Northwest, 7] kubera 
god of wealth management : North, 8] iishaana god of bliss : Northeast. The governance 
of all these deities is Indra's function, since he is the presiding deity of Heaven.

Shlok 9: "That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly 
torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even 
the Brahmans. [1-15-9]

[Commentary] The sura and a-sura nomenclature is the one that is commonly found in Vedic 
literature. sura is a celestial being and asura is its antonym, usually 
referred as a demon. Here it is not so because there are many asura-s who made their 
abode in heaven, like Rahu, Ketu, and others who attain salvation in this mortal life. Even 
Ravana came from Heaven, and returns there only at the end of the war with Rama. Thus 
a-sura-s are not earthly demons but celestial beings of a kind like other demi-gods, 
namely yaksha, gandharva, kinnara, kimpurusha etc.

Shlok 10: "The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on 
seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namely the ocean will not pulsate either. 
[1-15-10]

[Commentary] And ocean hides those undulating waves from Ravana for the waves are his wives whom Ravana 
may abduct as in the case of Seetha.

Shlok 11: "Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence 
oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination. [1-15-11]

Shlok 12: When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said "Aha! The 
idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned. [1-15-12]

Shlok 13: "Ravana said while seeking boon that, 'I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or 
by gods, or by other demons...' and I also said 'so be it..." [1-15-13]

Shlok 14: "That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his 
death does not occur otherwise." So said Brahma to gods. [1-15-14]

Shlok 15: On hearing Brahma explaining himself, then all those gods and great sages became adequately 
happy. [1-15-15]

Shlok 16- 17: In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted 
on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, 
clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and 
his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous 
gift called the rain. [1-15-16, 17]

[Commentary] Vishnu is a four handed deity. He handles a Divine Lotus suggesting that he is the creator
sR^iSTikartaa. An ever-cycling disc called sudarshana-chakra is handled 
symbolising his ever-lasting dynamism. He is the maintainer of that continuous dynamism of 
already created Universe sthiti-kartaa. A mace called kaumodakii for bludgeoning 
enemies as he is the eradicator of evil samhaarakartaa, and a conch-shell called
paanchajanya which produces the sound of Om, listening to which salvation, mukti, 
is achieved by the true devotee. The sound of the same conch shell gives out an unbearable 
sound in respect of enemies. He is entered here without a lotus in hand. That means there 
is no need for a creation afresh. The other items he is handling are enough to deal with Ravana. 
If the Lotus is not handled that hand is taken as a blessing hand, abhayahasta. 
And now he is giving that a+bhaya no fear, an assurance, to all gods.

[Commentary] The expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference to the previous 
chapter's garuDa-yajnavedi , Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire that is laid by priests 
of Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that Garuda, also called suparNa, 
the Divine Eagle will fly in to transport oblations. The Vedic ritual is also called suparNa, 
the golden winged, or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle 
of Vishnu is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here 
this Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the chanting of 
Vedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming mounted on the same meritorious 
carrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of Sun's coming mounted on a black cloud has some 
thing to do with yajna. A silver cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable 
combination with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall 
is due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals of Dasharatha, 
in the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun 
both are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will shower grace by eradicating the evil called 
Ravana, and the sun by showering the gratuitous and cooling rains.

Shlok 18: Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down 
and offering prayers addressed Vishnu. [1-15-18]

Shlok 19- 20- 21a: "Oh! Vishnu, desiring prosperity in all the worlds we nominate you to become the son of the 
ruler and lord of Ayodhya, namely Dasharatha, who is a virtuous one, renowned one and one 
whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king 
Dasharatha, who are in similitude with the hrii, the virtue, shrii, the 
affluence, and kiirti, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth 
as their son. [1-15-19, 20, 21a]

[Commentary] These three hrii, shrii, kiirti are the daughters of Daksha Prajapati in their earlier 
births. The hrii is hR^illekha , virtuous disposition - which Queen Kausalya 
has, and who begot Rama. The shrii is shriikaara , the affluence of everything, 
which Queen Sumitra has, by which alone she magnificently and unhesitatingly advises her son 
Lakshmana to go along with Rama to woods. And the third, kiirti, the glory, and the 
glory of Kaika is well known. The position of this epic minus Kaika can be imagined, thereby 
her glory, may it be negative, that may be imagined.

Shlok 21b- 22a: "Oh! Vishnu, on your taking birth as human through the wives of Dasharatha you eliminate Ravana 
in war, who has become exacerbating and thorny to all worlds, and who is otherwise not eliminable 
for gods. [1-15-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "He that preposterous demon Ravana with his invigorated doggedness is torturing gods along 
with eminent saints, gandharva-s, and siddha-s. [1-15-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "He that furious one with his insolence is knocking down sages from their celestial abodes, 
and like that he is knocking down the gandharva-s and apsara celestials too from the heavenly 
gardens Nandana, where they will be taking delight. [1-15-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "We the celestial beings like siddha-s, gandharva-s, yaksha-s along with sages have actually 
come for his elimination, and thereby we seek shelter in you. [1-15-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: "Oh, enemy tormentor, oh, Vishnu, you are the ultimate recourse for all us in eliminating 
enemies of divinity, hence you make up your mind to take birth in human world." The gods appealed 
to Vishnu that way. [1-15-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27: When the god of gods Vishnu, the supreme one among deities, one who is revered by all worlds 
is eulogised this way, then he spoke to all of those celestials that abide in the righteousness 
and that are in the assemblage, keeping the Forefather Brahma at their helm. [1-15-26a, 27]

Shlok 28- 29- 30a: "Get rid off the fear, let safety be upon you, on eliminating that cruel and evil-minded Ravana 
who became dreadful to deities and sages, along with his sons, grandsons, friends, cousins 
and relatives, ministers and forces too in war for your welfare, I will then reside in human 
world ruling this earth for eleven thousand years." Thus Vishnu assured the gods. [1-15-28, 
29, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: On giving boon to all gods in that way the kind-hearted god Vishnu started to think about 
the instituting base for his birth in human world. [1-15-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: And then that lotus-petal-eyed one agreeing to manifest himself in fourfold way is predisposed 
towards Dasharatha to be his father. [1-15-31b, 32a]

[Commentary] There is a great lot of discussion whether Vishnu made himself fourfold as Rama, Lakshmana, 
Bharata an Shatrughna, or he himself incarnated along with his main ingredients like conch 
shell, disc, mace as those three brothers. This verse says that he 'made himself, or agreed 
to make himself as fourfold.' Even then, there are discussions that Rama is a 'full incarnation'
puurNa avataara as the Supreme is indivisible - on one account. And his brothers 
cannot be reckoned as his incarnation  as they become parts of the whole but not the 
'whole' itself he did not divide himself on the other account. And the tradition believes 
that Vishnu did not divide himself but incarnated in one piece, where his brothers are his 
paraphernalia. There is no unanimity on this, as yet.

Shlok 32b: Then all the groups of gods, sages, gandharva-s, with rudraa-s, and apsarasa-s, extolled Vishnu 
with prayers of divine exposition. [1-15-32b, c]

[Commentary] Vishnu in early times killed a ghastly demon called Madhu and his brother Kaitabha, hence 
He is also called Madhusuudana. This is one the thousand names of Vishnu.

Shlok 33: "Oh! Vishnu, he that fiery one who is renowned for evil acts and who is the hater of Indra, 
that Ravana is uprising furiously with his heightened arrogance, and he has become a thorn in the 
side of hermits hence he is a fright to sages, afor he tortures insubordinates to the the extent of 
loud wailing; hence we pray you to eliminate that Ravana." [1-15-33]

Shlok 34: "On eliminating that furiously vainglorious Ravana with all his forces and with all his kinsmen 
neutralise the pandemonium created by him in all the worlds, and for a long time to come you 
get rid of your febrility, and you please return to your heavenly abode, namely your blameless 
and faultless Vaikuntha. [1-15-34]



SARGA 16
------------------------------

[Text] Vishnu agrees to incarnate as human and selects Dasharatha as his father. And when Dasharatha 
is performing the Vedic ritual called putrakaameSTi a deity called
praajaapatya-puruSha arises from the sacrificial fire to give 
a golden vessel of divine dessert to Dasharatha for distribution among his queens to beget 
progeny. The three queens on consuming that dessert conceive their children.

Shlok 1: Later when the Omnipresent Narayana is thus nominated by best gods, and though he knows the 
outcome, he gently spoke these words to gods in this way. [1-16-1]

[Commentary] The name Vishnu indicates his all pervading Omnipresence in all beings, sessile or mobile:
vyaapitvaat sarvabhuuteSu vishnuH iti abhidhiiyate. This is one of his thousand 
names, called Vishnu sahasranaama , each name elucidating his attributes.

Shlok 2: "What is the idea to eliminate that demon's chief Ravana, oh, gods, adopting which strategy 
I will have to eliminate that thorn in the side of sages?" Thus Vishnu asked the gods. [1-16-2]

Shlok 3: Asked thus all the gods said to that sempiternal Vishnu, "on assuming a human form, eliminate 
Ravana in a war." [1-16-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, destroyer of enemies, he that Ravana undertook a vehement ascesis for a long period, 
thereby the creator of worlds and the first born one Brahma, felt gladsome of his ascesis. 
[1-16-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "Satisfied with his ascesis Brahma gave boon to that demon that he shall have no fear for 
his life from many kinds of beings, excepting humans, because that demon indeed slighted humans 
earlier at the time of bestowing boon. [1-16-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7: "Thus, on getting boon from the Forefather Brahma he has become arrogant and torturing the 
three worlds, and he is even abducting women. As such, oh, enemy destroyer Vishnu, his elimination 
is envisaged through humans alone." So said gods to Vishnu. [1-16-6b, 7]

Shlok 8: On hearing that speech of gods said that way, he that kind-hearted Vishnu then chose Dasharatha 
as his father in human world. [1-16-8]

Shlok 9: During that time the great resplendent king and an enemy subduer Dasharatha is performing
putrakaameSTi ritual, desiring progeny as he is sonless. [1-16-9]

Shlok 10: On taking a decision Vishnu took leave of Forefather Brahma, and vanished while he is still 
being extolled by gods and sages. [1-16-10]

Shlok 11: Then, from Fire of Altar Dasharatha's ritual there emerged a greatly vigorous and energetic 
Divine Being with an unparalleled resplendence, called yajna-puruSa. 
[1-16-11]

Shlok 12: He is clad in black and red garments and his face is red and his voice resembled the drumbeat. 
His moustache and hairdo are soft like that of a lion's mane. [1-16-12]

Shlok 13: And he is endowed with auspicious features and decorated with divine ornaments, in height 
he is like a mountain peak, and in valiance he is like an imperious tiger. [1-16-13]

Shlok 14: That great ritual being personally brought a big golden vessel carrying it with both of his 
hands as if he would personally handle his own wife, which vessel is made from the molten 
gold and covered with a silver lid, and which appeared to be crafted out of a divine illusion, 
since it is dazzling like sun and glowing like the tongues of flame, and that vessel is full 
with the divine dessert. [1-16-14, 15]

Shlok 16: That divine person on observing king Dasharatha said these words "oh, king, you may know me 
as the being sent by Prajapati." [1-16-16]

Shlok 17: There after, king Dasharatha greeted that divine being with palms adjoining and said in reply, 
"oh, god, welcome to you, and what shall I do for you?" [1-16-17]

Shlok 18: Then again, that divine being sent by Prajapati said these words, "oh, king, now you have 
obtained this dessert in golden vessel as you have propitiated gods. [1-16-18]

Shlok 19: "Oh, tigerly king, take this dessert prepared by divinities, this is a blessed dessert that 
enriches progeny and health. [1-16-19]

Shlok 20: "Oh, king, let this be consumed" saying so he further said, "for which purpose you have performed 
this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give 
this among your eligible wives." So said the divine being to Dasharatha. [1-16-20]

Shlok 21: Agreeing to that the king wholeheartedly took that god-given golden vessel full with divine 
food. [1-16-21]

Shlok 22: With high ecstasy Dasharatha revered that Ritual Being, the Prajaapati- 
PuruSha or yaj~na-puruSha , an astonishing and delightful 
being in his appearance, and performed circumambulations around him. [1-16-22]

Shlok 23: On obtaining that dessert prepared by gods then Dasharatha is highly gladdened like a pauper 
obtaining unforeseen wealth. [1-16-23]

Shlok 24: On completing his work of giving the golden vessel with dessert then that divine being who 
is astonishing by his form and highly glowing by his physique, disappeared then and there 
itself. [1-16-24]

Shlok 25: Lit up with beams of happiness Dasharatha's palace chambers shone forth like the autumnal 
sky brightened with moonbeams. [1-16-25]

Shlok 26: Then Dasharatha on entering palace chambers spoke this to queen Kausalya, "Receive this dessert 
to beget your son." [1-16-26]

[Commentary] This divine dessert is meant for the 'eligible' queens, as informed the Ritual Being and also 
in order to maintain the divinity of Ram's birth. In the context of seed and field, the field 
has no equal importance to the seed biija-kShetra nyaaya . Hence the seed is divine 
in the form of dessert and fields are therefore shall 'be eligible' for the seedling. As such 
the First Queen and Empress Kausalya is being addressed firstly, and given firstly.

Shlok 27- 28: The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the half, i.e., 
one fourth to queen Sumitra. And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one 
eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, 
i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to 
his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]

[Commentary] This is a much-discussed distribution by the traditionalists. Adhyaatma Ramayana, a treatise 
that postulates god-hood to Rama, gives a well-constructed argument about these shares of 
dessert and the resultant births of the four brothers, viz., Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and 
Shatrughna, in accordance with these shares. In its simplest terms and as contained in these 
verses, queen Kausalya got half of the dessert as an Empress, paTTa-mahiSi. Sumitra 
gets one-fourth in the first round and after a rethink by Dasharatha, she gets another one-eighth 
portion. Kaikeyi gets only a one-eighth quantity. Thus, Kausalya gives birth to Rama, Sumitra 
to Lakshmana and Shatrughna, and Kaikeyi to Bharata. The quantum of apportionment of the dessert 
does not make Rama all-powerful or Bharata the least. Since the Absolute is indivisible into 
parts, the dessert that is divided is not to be taken as the divided Absolute, but a kind 
of medium through which the incarnation is made possible.

[Commentary] There is another declination enquiring whether the incarnation of Rama is full or partial,
puurNa-avatara or ardha-avatara... Rama is Vishnu Himself while Bharata 
and Shatrughna are his disc and conch-shell, while Lakshmana is the thousand headed snake
aadisheSha on whose coils Vishnu reclines. The whole dessert is divine and parts 
of it do not signify and inter-divided god-hoods. Hence, the apportionment of the desert is 
done in order to keep up the hierarchy of the queen-hoods and their status. Throughout this 
magnum opus Rama never said that he is god or an incarnate of god, but called himself, 
nimitta-maatra a casual relation to the course of events. Should Rama be the incarnation 
of the Almighty Himself, he has little or no necessity to incarnate the weaponry along with 
him. They are at his beck and call at any time. Thus, Rama is neither a half nor one-fourth 
incarnation of the Absolute nor a dividend of the whole, but an incarnate of the virtuously 
ideal personality of Vishnu, maryaadaa purushottama Rama.

[Commentary] Incidental to this apportionment of the dessert, the aspect of eldest son is also studied. 
Rama is the first-born and thus the eldest. This is because the dessert is given to queen 
Kausalya in the first instance, and half of the whole vessel. She immediately consumed to 
lionise her share and as an Empress. Sumitra waited a while till apportionment is complete. 
Kaikeyi got her portion but waited till her elder sister Sumitra completes her drink. In the 
meanwhile Dasharatha thought a while, as said in the verse, and gave Sumitra another one-eighth 
part. Sumitra then consumed her two parts. Later Kaikeyi drinks her dividend.

Shlok 30: On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with 
happiness, deemed it as a reward. [1-16-30]

Shlok 31: Then on consuming dessert those best ladies of the king whose resplendence then vied with 
that Fire and Sun became pregnant after some time. [1-16-31]

[Commentary] A synecdochic expression to indicate that Sun and Fire, the enliveners of living beings,
pratyakSha-naraayaNa are there in those wombs and their resplendence is shining out 
of mothers bodies.

Shlok 32: Then on seeing his queens with confirmed pregnancies Dasharatha regained his lost heart for 
sons, and he is gladdened like Vishnu, who will always be gladsome when worshipped by gods, 
namely Indra and others, as well as by the assemblages of great souls, sages. [1-16-32]

[Text] The gods become progenitors Vanara heroes at the dictate of Brahma to come to 
			the aid of Rama in annihilating Ravana. The monkey-like Vanara race is procreated 
			by numerous celestials endowing it with peculiar mighty physique and particular 
			power to come to the help of Rama.

Shlok 1: When Vishnu attained the sonship of the great-souled king Dasharatha, then Brahma 
			the self-created addressed all of the gods this way. [1-17-1]

Shlok 2: "Let mighty and guise changing helpmates be procreated to that truth abiding and 
			valorous Vishnu who is the well-wisher of all of us. [1-17-2]

Shlok 3: "Let monkey-shaped progeny equalling Vishnu's valour be procreated from the physiques 
			of prominent apsara-s and gandharva-s, from the girls of yaksha-s and pannaga-s, 
			and also thus from the bodies of kinnaraa-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, she-riksha-s 
			and she-monkeys, and they shall be wizards of miracles and audacious ones, in 
			travel they shall have air's speed, bestowed with intellect they shall be the 
			knowers of ideation, and with their divine physique they shall be ineliminable, 
			they shall be endowed with all the assaultive aspects of all missiles, and they 
			shall be untiring in their efforts, like you who thrive on amrita, the ambrosia, 
			unmindful of thirst and hunger. [1-17-3, 4, 5, 6]

[Commentary] Gandharva-s (Southey's Glendoveers) are celestial musicians inhabiting Indra's 
			heaven and forming the orchestra at all the banquets of the principal deities. 
			Yaksha-s, demigods attendant especially on Kubera, and employed by him in the 
			care of his garden and treasures. Kimpurusha-s, demigods attached also to the 
			service of Kubera, celestial musicians, represented like centaurs reversed with 
			human figures and horses' heads. Siddha-s, are demigods or spirits of undefined 
			attributes, occupying with the Vidyaadharaa-s the middle air or region between 
			the earth and the sun. Griffith.

Shlok 7: "I have already created the eminent bear Jambavanta in earlier times, as he suddenly 
			came forth from my yawning face. [1-17-7]

[Commentary] This is to say that Brahma has already created such a typical being, namely Jambavanta, 
			prior to all the gods, as a role model in creation.

Shlok 8: When Brahma addressed them thus, those gods have agreed to his order and accordingly 
			started to parent sons in the resemblance of monkeys. [1-17-8]

[Commentary] This pedigree is not yet given the label of monkeys. They are look alike of monkeys 
			but not monkeys, vaanararuupiNam resembling monkeys, as said in the verse. 
			The word vanara is vane carati iti vanaraH because they range far and 
			wide over forests they are called vanara-s, but not exactly a monkey race.

Shlok 9: The great-souled celestial groups, namely the sages, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, 
			caarana-s have created valiant sons that are forest rangers. [1-17-9]

Shlok 10: Indra procreated the lord of vanara-s, namely Vali, who by his physique is like 
			Mt. Mahendra, and the highest humidifier among all the humidifiers, namely the 
			Sun, procreated Sugreeva. [1-17-10]

Shlok 11: Brihaspati, the Jupiter, gave rise to a great monkey named Tara, who is the most 
			important one among all vanara-s, and who excels all by his intelligence. [1-17-11]

[Commentary] Tara here is a vanara hero but not Lady Tara, the wife of Vali. Here we have the 
			wording of kapiH the monkey ï¿½ for these forest rangers for first time.

Shlok 12: The brilliant Gandhamaadana is the son of Kubera, while the divine architect Vishvakarma 
			procreated the great monkey called Nala. [1-17-12]

Shlok 13: The bright son of Fire is Neela whose blaze is like that of fire and who excels 
			other monkeys by his resplendence, renown and courage. [1-17-13]

Shlok 14: The Ashwin twin gods whose wealth is their beautiful appearance have personally 
			procreated two vanara-s namely Mainda and Dvivida, blessing them with beautiful 
			appearance.[1-17-14]

Shlok 15: The Rain-god procreated the vanara named Sushena, and Thunder-god gave rise 
			to the great mighty Sharabha. [1-17-15]

Shlok 16- 17a: The direct son of Air-god is the marvellous and adventurous Hanuma with an indestructible 
			body, and one identical in the speed of lady Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the 
			divine eagle vehicle of Vishnu, and among all monkey chiefs he is the intelligent 
			and the indefatigable one too. [1-17-16, 17a]

[Commentary] Garuda: The bird and vehicle of Vishnu. He is generally represented as a being 
			something between a man and a bird and considered as the sovereign of the feathered 
			race. He may be compared with the Simurgh of the Persians, the Ank of the Arabs, 
			the Griffin of chivalry [without lion's body,] the Phoenix of Egypt, and the bird 
			that sits upon the ash Yggdrasil of the Edda. - Griffith.

Shlok 17b- 18a: Thus the gods have procreated many thousands of such valorous and guise changing 
			monkeys who with their immeasurable strength and bravery are manifest for the 
			elimination of the decahedral demon Ravana. [1-17-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: And they with their elephantine, mountainous and prodigious bodies quickly took 
			birth in bears, monkeys, sacred langoors. [1-17-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Those that are procreated have attained the shape, getup and valour of the god 
			that has fathered them, and thus the monkey race is procreated separately and 
			individually. [1-17-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: Some of the vanara-s endowed with superior valour are born to female langoors, 
			and like that some more to female bears and kinnaraa-s. [1-17-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22- 23- 24a: Several of the gods, great-sages, gandharva-s, eagles, yaksha-s, and the celebrated 
			reptiles, kimpurusha-s, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, uraga-s and caarana-s and even 
			the prominent maidens of apsara-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, naaga, gandharva-s then 
			gladly procreated all of the thousands of forest-ranging and valiant vanara sons 
			from their bodies that are forest rangers. [21b, 22, 23, 24a, b]

Shlok 24b- 25a: They are endowed with guise changing faculties, with bodily might and by their 
			pride and might are identical to lions and tigers, and they are born-free in their 
			movement in forests. [1-17-24c, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: All of them are the assaulters with stones, and all are the attackers with trees, 
			and all have their nails and claws as their weapons, yet all are experts in missiles. 
			[1-17-25b, 26a]

[Commentary] Rama and Lakshmana will use arrows and missiles as their weaponry in the ensuing 
			final war with Ravana. The vanara soldiers use stones, trees, and their own claws 
			and nails. The golden maces or clubs handled by Hanuma, Sugreeva, and Vali usually 
			depicted in pictures are for more mythical ornamentation to glorify the characters. 
			However, these Vaanaras are well versed in the knowledge of such tactical weaponry, 
			only to save themselves from their usage against them, but do not use them necessarily. 
			In Sundara Kanda Hanuma will be tied by a magical weapon called Brahmaastra when 
			he is in Lanka. Though knowing the release from that Brahmaastra, Hanuma does 
			not utilise that knowledge there.

Shlok 26b- 27a: They can rock greatest mountains, rip firm rooted trees, and with their speed 
			they can agitate the of lord of rivers, namely the ocean. [1-17-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: They can shatter the ground with their two feet, leap and cross over great oceans, 
			and they can seize the clouds entering arch of heaven. [1-17-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: They can catch ruttish elephants that tumultuously move in forests, and just with 
			the sound of their blare they make sky flying birds to fall. [1-17-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Thus the gods and others have procreated millions of such noble souled Vaanaras 
			as the chiefs of warriors who can change their guise at their wish. [1-17-29b, 
			30a]

Shlok 30a- 31b: Those vanara generals who took birth thus became the prominent generals among 
			the principle battalions of monkeys, and they have also procreated brave monkeys 
			on their own. [1-17-30a, 31b]

Shlok 31b- 32a: Some thousands of them stayed on the ridges of Mt. Rikshavat while others reached 
			many kinds of other mountains and forests. [1-17-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33: All of the monkeys stood by the brothers, namely the son of Indra Vali, and the 
			son of sun Sugreeva, and even with the monkey generals like Nala, Neela and Hanuma 
			et al. [1-17-32b, 33]

Shlok 34: All of those who are well-versed in warfare and endowed with the might of divine 
			eagle Garuda, used to thwart the pride of lions, tigers and great snakes just 
			by their own prideful subjugation while they move about the forests. [1-17-34]

Shlok 35: He who is adroit, extremely mighty, and highly indomitable, that Vali protected 
			bears, langoors, and monkeys just by the strength of his arms. [1-17-35]

Shlok 36: The earth with its mountains, forests and oceanward places is overspread with 
			those brave ones that possess diverse physiques and peculiar indication marks 
			of their stock. [1-17-36]

Shlok 37: The earth is thus suffused with those mighty army generals of Vanara race whose 
			physiques resembled the clusters of clouds and peaks of mountains, and who have 
			emerged for the reason of helping Rama. [1-17-37]



SARGA 18
------------------------------

[Text] After the completion of Vedic ritual all the kings and Sage Rishyasringa took leave of Dasharatha 
and went away to their countries. After some time Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna 
are born. Their virtues in childhood and rituals connected thereto are depicted here. Dasharatha 
then contemplates the marriages of the princes, since marrying sons after completion of education 
is customary. At that juncture Sage Vishvamitra arrives at the court of Dasharatha seeking 
help from the king. Dasharatha receives him adoring in high esteem.

Shlok 1: On the competition of the horse ritual of high-souled Dasharatha, the golds having received 
their portion of sacrificial oblation returned to their abodes as they have come. [1-18-1]

Shlok 2: The king completing his consecratory vows held for horse ritual, entered Ayodhya city along 
with the company of his queens, servants, guards and vehicles. [1-18-2]

Shlok 3: The other kings who arrived for the ritual are delighted when befittingly honoured by the 
king Dasharatha, and they too returned to their countries, after suitably adoring the eminent 
sage Vashishta. [1-18-3]

Shlok 4: The entourages of those kings who set forth homeward from that city are highly gladdened and 
shone forth in fine fettle. [1-18-4]

[Commentary] Some commentaries said that the soldiers are given white and clean uniforms by Dasharatha 
by the word shubhraaNi and hence they are happy. But they may be said to be sprucely 
without those gifts from Dasharatha.

Shlok 5: On the departure of visiting kings, then that fortunate king Dasharatha entered the city Ayodhya, 
keeping eminent Brahman priests ahead of him in the procession. [1-18-5]

Shlok 6: Well adored by king Dasharatha sage Rishyasringa also travelled along with his wife Shanta, 
followed by his father-in-law King Romapada, and along with other co-travellers, namely the 
entourage of Romapada. [1-18-6]

Shlok 7: On dispersing all of them king Dasharatha gratifyingly dwelled there in Ayodhya, with a satiated 
heart dwelling upon the birth of his sons. [1-18-7]

Shlok 8- 9- 10- 11: On completion of the ritual, six seasons have passed by; then in the twelfth month, i.e., 
in chaitra-mAsa, and on the ninth day of that chaitra month [April-May], 
when it is punarvasunakShatrayukta-navamI tithi, i.e., when the ruling star of that 
ninth day is punarvasu, 
for which Aditi is the presiding deity; and when five of the nine planets - sUrya, kuja, guru, 
shukra, shani are in ucChasthAna-s, namely, when those planets are in 
ascension in their respective houses - meSha, makara, karkaTa, mIna, tula - rAshI-s; and when chandrayukta- 
guru, karkaTalagne - Jupiter in conjuction with Moon is ascendant in Cancer, and when day is advancing, 
Queen Kausalya gave birth to a son with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, 
lengthy arms, roseate lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku 
dynasty and adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, 
namely Rama. [1-18-8, 9, 10, 11]



Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month 
of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to 
take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be 
known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory of the grand line of Ikshwku, and 
the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was 
chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension 
in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and 
the Moon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled 
effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the 
Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, 1910.

[Commentary] By this configuration of stars the supreme merits of Rama are indicated.
atra sa~mvatsaramukhottaraayaNa-vasantacaitramaasa-shuklapakShaadeva nakShatra-divaabhijitlagna- 
nakShatra-divaabhijitlagna-puNyanakShatraad utkR^iShTakaale karkaaTakalagne uccasya grahapa~ncake guru-

sakalashiShTaadaraNiiyasampattim mahaaparaakramam ca suucitam |dharmaakuutam.

[Commentary] The phrase viSNoH adtham half of Vishnu - is to be taken as
half of the fruit of ritual where Vedic ritual itself is pervaded 
by Vishnu. The fruit of ritual is obtained in the shape of dessert, and Kausalya consumed 
half of it, but it is not half of Vishnu as he is illimitable. Even Sreenivasa Aiyangar took 
it as half, in saying half of Vishnu's essence is Rama. This has become a perennial topic debating whether 
the incarnation of Rama is a pUrNaavatAra, ardhaavatAra or aMshaavatAra.

Shlok 12: Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who 
once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods. [1-18-12]

Shlok 13: Queen Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, one embodied with all merits, and whose truthfulness 
itself is his valour and who is fourth component of manifest Vishnu, namely Rama. [1-18-13]

[Commentary] The fraction indicated here like 'one fourth of Vishnu' etc may be reckoned as the share of 
the dessert consumed by the queens, but not as a cleaved portion of Vishnu as he is an indivisible 
entity. Here it is half of one-fourth i.e., one-eighth of dessert given to Kaikeyi.

Shlok 14: Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely 
Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry. [1-18-14]

Shlok 15: With the dawn of sun on the next day, fair-minded Bharata is born under Pisces where puSyami 
			is the star of day, later the sons of Sumitra, namely Lakshmana and Shatrughna are 
			born under Cancer, where aashleSa is the star of the 
			day, i.e., the tenth of chaitra month, [1-18-15]

[Commentary] Rama is born on the ninth day of Chaitra month, and Bharata is born in the earlier 
			part of next day the tenth of Chaitra, earlier to his younger brothers, and then 
			Lakshmana and Shatrughna are born on the later part of that tenth day.

[Commentary] 'Pushya is the name of a month; but here it means the eighth mansion. The ninth is called 
AshleSh, or the snake. It is evident from this that Bharata, though his birth is mentioned 
before that of the twins, was the youngest of the four brothers and Rama's junior by eleven 
months' -- Schlegel.

[Commentary] The eleven-month gap between Rama and Bharata is unapparent in the words 
of verse. This may be from some other version of Ramayana.

Shlok 16: Thus there are four great-souled sons of Dasharatha, born on separate instances, who are virtuous, 
charming, and by brilliance they are in similitude with two stars of each of the asterisms 
called puurvaabhaadra and uttaraabhaadra. 
[1-18-16]

[Commentary] The word proSTa is cow; pada feet; the feet of a cow. It is also the name 
for the asterisms puurvaabhaadra, uttaraabaadra, containing stars in the wing of 
Pegasus, each of which will have two stars, and all the four stars make a perfect square. 
Like the pairs of stars the brother also move in pairs - Rama, Lakshmana; Bharata, Shatrughna.

[Commentary] The epithet mahaatmaanaH high-souled ones is though negligible for peripheral reading, 
it is explained as: Rama is one such, as he undertakes svadharmaanuSThaana ; Lakshmana 
by his sheSatvaj~naana ; Bharata by his bhagavatpaaratantrya ; and Shatrughna 
by his bhaagavata-paaratantrya.

[Commentary] Like this, each of the epithets used in Ramayana has something or the other meaning which 
is not generally recorded in English translations. All the English translations are story-oriented, 
as though there is some unknown story in Ramayana for retelling afresh. In the spate of telling 
story again and again these niceties are lost. The same is the position with the numerous 
epithets given to Seetha in Aranya Kanda. Readers may please note that each epithet conveys 
some meaning and if we could not incorporate them, it is our misfortune in getting a book 
containing their meanings. We request the readers to kindly inform us if they have come across 
the meanings of these seemingly useless and metre-filling-like epithets in any book, so that, 
that book will be brought to the notice of readers who are mistaking them as 'redundant stanza 
fillers'.

Shlok 17- 18a: The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums 
drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with 
thronging people. [1-18-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: Hilarity filled the streets with people stampeding them and with the flurry of actors, dancers, 
singers and instrumentalists, as well by other onlookers, and there on the streets widely 
strewn are all kinds of gems appreciating the artists. [1-18-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: The king gave worthy gifts to eulogisers, bard singers, and panegyrists, and to Brahmans he 
gave funds and wealth in the form of thousands of cows. [1-18-20]

Shlok 21- 22: Elapsed are eleven days and the naming ceremony is performed, then Vashishta, the chief priest, 
named the high-souled elder one as Rama, Kaikeyi's son as Bharata, and one son of Sumitra 
as Lakshmana and the other as Shatrughna [1-18-21, 22]

[Commentary] The word 'Rama' is defined as 
ramante sarve janaaH guNaiH asmin iti raamaH 'in whom all the people 
take delight for his virtuousness, thus he is Rama.' The name Rama is very old, so says
padma puraaNa : shriyaH kamalavaasinyaH raameNaaham mahaaprabhuH |
 tasmaat shriiraama iti asya naamasiddhi puraatanam || padma puraaNa

[Commentary] Bharata is defined as: bharataH raajyabharaNaat - bibharti iti bharata
 Bharata is because he bears the burden of the kingdom of Rama during Rama's exile.

[Commentary] Lakshmana is lakShmaNo laksmisampannaH or
lakShmiiH asya astiiti lakShmaNa Lakshmana is the favoured flourisher. 
The wealth of selfless dedication is in him, hence Lakshmana. One who is endowed with favoured 
dedication, kainkaryalakShaNalakshitaH Lakshmana is a hearty dedication to Rama 
and he always wishes to reside by the side of his brother.

[Commentary] Shatrughna is shatruun hanti iti shatrughnaH. Or 
shatrughno nityashatru-ghnaHShatrughna is always an enemy destroyer.

[Commentary] The naming ceremony acquires a particular significance, because Vashishta, the purohita 
= puraa future; hitaH well-wisher of; well wishing advisor about the future 
of the kingdom, named these princes with a vision into the future.

Shlok 23- 24a: The king feasted Brahmans, urbanites and villagers and he gifted many valuable gems to Brahmans 
in an unlimited way, and all the rituals of birth and ceremonies sequel to it like naming 
ceremony, first-food-feeding ceremony, first-hair-removal ceremony, and sacred thread ceremony 
are performed in respect of the princes. [1-18-23, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: Among those princes the eldest one Rama is like a flagstaff and a delight of his father Dasharatha, 
and he became acceptable to all beings like the self-created Brahma. [1-18-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: All the princes are scholars in Veda-s, valiant ones, all are interested in the welfare of 
the world, all are intellectuals and all of them possess an air of probity. [1-18-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: Among them the great resplendent Rama, whose valour itself is his truthfulness, is the dear 
one to all the world like the tranquil moon. [1-18-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: Rama is admittedly a champion of riding elephants and horses, also in tactical charioting, 
and he rejoices in the art of archery, and absorbed in the obedient service of his father. 
[1-18-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: Right from childhood Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, is always amiable towards his 
world-charming elder brother Rama. [1-18-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Lakshmana who is endowed with the wealth of dedication dedicated himself to Rama with bodily 
service, and while performing all agreeable deeds in respect of Rama, he behaved like Rama's 
alter ego. [1-18-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: That best one among the men Rama does not get his sleep without Lakshmana and he would 
not eat food brought for him, however delicious it may be, without Lakshmana. [1-18-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: Whenever Raghava mounts a horse and goes on a hunting game Lakshmana rushes after him wielding 
his bow as a squire. [1-18-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: Lakshmana's younger brother Shatrughna is a dear one to Bharata, like that Bharata too held 
Shatrughna dearer than his own lives. [1-18-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33: King Dasharatha is highly gladdened with four of his highly fortunate sons like the Forefather 
Brahma with gods in heaven. [1-18-33]

Shlok 34b- 35- 36a: When all of the four sons are thus prospering with prudence, gifted with all the merits, self-conscious 
to do wrong deeds, well-known for their gentility, knowers of pros and cons and even the conscientious 
princes, then their father Dasharatha is contented in respect of all of them who are such 
radiantly brilliant and potential princes, like Brahma. [1-18-34b, 35, 36a]

Shlok 36: Even those tigerly-men, namely the princes, are engrossed in the studies of Veda-s, delighted 
to render service to their father and they are also the experts in art of archery. [1-18-36b, 
37a]

Shlok 37b- 38a: Then the noble souled Dasharatha contemplated along with his priestly teachers and relatives 
about the matrimonial alliances of his sons. [1-18-37b, 38a]

Shlok 38b- 39a: While the great souled Dasharatha is discussing the marriages of princes among his ministers, 
the highly powerful sage Vishvamitra arrived. [1-18-38b, 39a]

Shlok 39b- 40a: Desirous to have an audience with king Vishvamitra said to the doorkeeper, "Let the king be 
informed quickly that I, the son of Gadhi from the dynasty of Kushi, have come" [1-18-39b, 
40a]

Shlok 40b- 41a: On listening those words all the doorkeepers are dumbfounded, and ushered by those words they 
quickly rushed to the place of Dasharatha. [1-18-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b- 42a: Then on their arriving at the king's palace the doorkeepers have announced to the king of 
Ikshvaku-s, namely Dasharatha, about the arrival of sage Vishvamitra. [1-18-41b, 42a]

Shlok 42b- 43a: On hearing that message from doorkeepers Dasharatha is highly pleased and he has gone towards 
Vishvamitra in a self-possessed manner along with royal priests, as Indra would ceremoniously 
go towards Brahma. [1-18-42b, 43a]

Shlok 43b- 44a: Then on seeing the resplendent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is by his own ascesis and 
who has severe self-discipline, the king offered water with a gladsome aspect, as first customary 
hospitality in receiving unexpected guest. [1-18-43b, 44a]

Shlok 44b- 45a: On receiving water from the king scripturally and customarily Vishvamitra enquired after the 
well-being and welfare of king Dasharatha. [1-18-44b, 45a]

Shlok 45b- 46a: That highly righteous sage Vishvamitra asked the king after the well-being of city, exchequer, 
rural areas, friends and relatives. [1-18-45b, 46a]

Shlok 46b- 47a: Sage Vishvamitra asked Dasharatha, "Are all of the provincial kings acquiescent to you, and 
all your enemies conquered? Are you properly performing the devotional and social works?" 
[1-18-46b, 47a]

Shlok 47b- 48a: And on meeting the eminent sage Vashishta and with them the other exalted sages according 
to custom Vishvamitra asked after their well-being. [1-18-47b, 48a]

Shlok 48b- 49a: Then adoringly invited by the king Dasharatha all of them gladly entered the palace and they 
took their seats according to protocol. [1-18-48b, 49a]

Shlok 49b- 50a: Then the very generous king Dasharatha is gladdened at heart at the arrival of Vishvamitra, 
and he spoke this way feeling happy to adore that sage. [1-18-49b, 50a]

Shlok 50b- 51- 52b: "I deem your arrival is in the vein of mortals attaining ambrosia, rainfall in a droughty 
land, a barren father begetting a son through his deserving wife, a regain of long lost treasures, 
and the gladness at a great happening, oh, great saint, welcome to you." [1-18-50b, 51, 52a]

Shlok 52b- 53- 54a: "Oh, Brahman, as I am the one who is delighted for your arrival, and as you are the most eligible 
recipient from me, what is that choicest object of yours to be fulfilled by me, and in which 
way. Oh, endower of respect, for me your arrival is fortunate whereby my birth is fructified 
and my life flourished today, and wherefore I could see a great Brahman like you visiting 
my home, therefore the sun appears to have dawned in my night. [1-18-52b, 53, 54a]

Shlok 54b- 55a: "Originally your glory was explicit by your title kingly-sage, and subsequently you 
attained the Absolute-sainthood by your ascesis, and you are venerable to me, in many 
ways." [1-18-54b, 55a]

Shlok 55b- 56a: "Oh, Brahman, thereby your arrival at my place is surprising and ideally sacred to me, and 
by your very appearance I have become one who has gone on a quiet pilgrimage. [1-18-55b, 56a]

[Commentary] Dasharatha deems that city itself is sanctified with the arrival of Vishvamitra and thinks 
that he is like the one who secured the merit of pilgrimage without actually going over a 
sacred place.

Shlok 56b- 57a: "You may tell me, entreating which work your arrival chanced here and I feel that I am indeed 
blessed and wish to make it happen to achieve results. [1-18-56b, 57a]

Shlok 57b- 58a: "It is unapt of you to deliberate about the feasibility of the work, oh, sage with blest vows, 
while I am the fulfiller of it without any reminder, since you are god to me, indeed. [1-18-57b, 
58a]

Shlok 58b: "Oh, Brahman, this is the great prosperity that bechanced on me, and this is propriety in 
its entirety that bechanced on me, as a result of your arrival. [1-18-58b, c]

Shlok 59: On hearing the words of high-minded Dasharatha, said that way in all his humbleness, and those 
that are pleasant to ears as well to heart, he who is a renowned for his personal attributes 
and a reputed one by his exceptional qualities, that sublime sage Vishvamitra obtained high 
rejoice. [1-18-59]



SARGA 19
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra asks King Dasharatha to send Rama to protect the Vedic ritual 
			that is being conducted by him, from the demons that are constantly disrupting 
			it. The sage asserts King Dasharatha that he and the other sages in Dasharatha's 
			court know the capabilities of Rama and though Rama is in his adolescence, he 
			can easily kill the demons. But Dasharatha is upset at this request.

Shlok 1: On listening the grand and detailed sentences of that King the lion Dasharatha, 
			the great resplendent Sage Vishvamitra is thrilled with happiness and spoke this 
			way. [1-19-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, tigerly king, to you befitting are these words and to none else, as you are 
			born in a great dynasty and tutored by Vashishta. [1-19-2]

Shlok 3: "What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, 
			oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises. [1-19-3]

Shlok 4: "These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, 
			oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that 
			ritual. [1-19-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained 
			demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams 
			of meat and blood. [1-19-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the 
			ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. [1-19-6n, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: "And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall 
			be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, 
			isn't it. [1-19-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "As such, oh, tigerly king, it will be apt of you spare the services of that brave 
			one whose valour itself is his truthfulness, that youngling whose hair locks are 
			all the more jet black like crow wings on either side of his head, spare that 
			eldest son of yours, namely Rama. [1-19-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual 
			by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. [1-19-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown 
			in all the three worlds, no doubt about it. [1-19-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Those two demons will be rendered incapable to stand fast on affronting Rama 
			in anywise, and none other than Raghava has the fortitude to eliminate those two. 
			[1-19-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Those two sinners that are berserk by their vigour have gone into the subjection 
			of death's noose, oh tigerly king, cannot counterbalance the great-souled Rama. 
			[1-19-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "It will be unapt of you to show your paternal fondness, oh, king, upon my oath, 
			be assured that those two demons are eradicated. [1-19-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "I am sensible of that sublime-soul Rama, whose valour is his truthfulness, and 
			even this great resplendent Vashishta and these saints that are here are aware. 
			[1-19-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] These verses are commented extensively by early commentators. In 14th verse, the 
			pronoun aham, 'I' used by Sage Vishvamitra is to announce definiteness 
			about his own stature to know the Absolute vis-a-vis the Absolute Himself. Vishvamitra 
			was an emperor who left off everything. He was primarily a raajarShi, 
			kingly sage, later became brahmarShi and performed mokShakaameSTi. 
			That is a highest ascesis for achieving salvation. Whereas Dasharatha performed 
			Vedic ritual called putrakaameSTi, ritual for begetting sons, as he 
			is still involved in earthly passions. Thus he is still in karmic cycle and recently 
			went under the veil of moha, worldly delusion, advent to the birth of 
			sons. So Dasharatha cannot know who Rama is. All these aspects are said to qualify 
			that expression aham, i.e., 'I am', as said by Vishvamitra.

[Commentary] He also says aham vedmi , it is not just 'I know' but 'I am in full knowledge 
			of Rama' and it is immediately followed by mahaatmaanam, about the 
			sublime soul Rama. Rama is at present a twelve-year lad, and Dasharatha should 
			have enquired how a boy is said to be a sublime-soul. Dasharatha did not bother 
			to enquire about the high souled property of his son, because of his newfound 
			fondness for sons. But, Vishvamitra is in full knowledge as to who Rama is, and 
			says Rama is a sublime-soul, as contained in scripture puruSasuukta 
			which says vedaahametam puruSam mahaantam, and as in yo maam pashyati sarvatra....sa ca Me 
			na praNasyati Bhagavad Gita, 6-30, as well.

[Commentary] In next foot at 15th verse, Vishvamitra argues that he is not just extolling Rama 
			to achieve his personal purpose, i.e., the completion of ritual. He says, 
			vashiSTho api even Sage Vashishta, knows Rama. Here the word api 
			, even, is said to have been used to qualify Vashishta as an antagonist of Vishvamitra 
			in policy differences. 'Even my opponent, this Sage Vashishta, the descendent 
			of Goddess Saraswati and Brahma, and a brahmarSi, Absolute-knower, and 
			at whose instance I became a brahmarSi from raajarSi , is aware 
			of Rama...' is the argument of Vishvamitra, stressing his neutrality in seeking 
			Rama's help.

[Commentary] Still Vishvamitra tells that ye cheme tapasi sthitaaH , 'those sages 
			that are here who are rooted in ascesis' as in the vein of puruSasuukta 
			which says tasya dhiiraaH pratijaananti yonim. Vishvamitra's argument 
			is 'Sage Vashishta may take sides with you, because he is rajaguru , 
			the royal priest, while the others like Kaashyapa, Vaamadeva will tell you clearly, 
			as they have no leaning on your court.'

[Commentary] All said and done, King Dasharatha is still lingering for a reply. Seeing that 
			Vishvamitra further says, 'if you want to achieve renown, send Rama.' No father 
			rejoices that much when a son is birthed than on his achieving reputation. Dasharatha 
			is advised in the same way when saying yadi dharmalaabham, yasho laabham 
			'if you want renown through a worthy son, who will be renowned in all three worlds 
			by his coming with me, then you send Rama...'

[Commentary] Now Rama's reputation is going to be enhanced by Sage Vishvamitra in eliminating 
			demoness Tataka, in releasing Ahalya from her curse, breaking Shiva's bow, marriage 
			with Seetha, rebuffing Parashuraama etc. And also Vishvamitra leaves the decision 
			to Dasharatha, 'if only your ministers, clergy as well political, permit then 
			alone you send Rama with me...'

Shlok 15b- 16a: "If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown 
			on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. [1-19-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite 
			headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. [1-19-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for 
			ten days of the ritual without temporising. [1-19-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "I wish you to take decision as to how my ritual's time is not lapsed, and 
			let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve." Thus Vishvamitra 
			said to Dasharatha. [1-19-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: On saying those words that comprise fairness and meaningfulness that virtue-souled 
			great saint with great resplendence paused. [1-19-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21: On hearing the propitious words of sage Vishvamitra that best king Dasharatha 
			shuddered and swooned as he is muffled up with profound adversity, and after that 
			on regaining consciousness he sunk down in fear. [1-19-20b, 21]

Shlok 22: This way on hearing that word of the saint Vishvamitra which is explicitly slitting 
			his mind and heart that illustrious and noble-souled king Dasharatha then became 
			highly annoyed at heart, and flustered extremely in his throne. [1-19-22]



SARGA 20
------------------------------

[Text] On enquiring details about those dangerous demons that are ravaging sage's ritual, King Dasharatha 
refuses to send young Rama along with Sage Vishvamitra on many an account, and thus confronts 
the Sage's wrath.

Shlok 1: On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for 
a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. [1-20-1]

Shlok 2: ""Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him 
with the demons. [1-20-2]

[Commentary] This particular statement uunaSoDashavarSaH less than sixteen years, has evoked 
a spate of commentaries in deciding the age of Rama at this juncture of going along with Sage 
Viswamitra, i.e., at the time of his marrying Seeta and at the time of his exile to forests 
etc. His age is said to be twelve years as of now. And this is confirmed by Mareecha while 
advising Ravana, that 'as a boy of twelve Rama, killed my mother and brother, and hit me out' 
as at 3-38-6, uunadvaadashavarSaH Or, baalo dvaadashavarSo ayam as per 
other versions of the same verse.

[Commentary] Ramayana has some bearing on the number twelve. The Books or Kaanda-s are 6, half of twelve. 
The total verses are 24 thousand, two folds of twelve thousand. Rama is born in twelfth month. 
Vishvamitra's arrival, or better said as Seethaa-kalyaaNa , Seetha's marriage with 
Rama, is in the twelfth year. His stay in Ayodhya before crown prince ceremony and exile is 
for twelve years. The years of Rama's exile are twelve, plus two years stay in Panchavati, 
of the total fourteen years of exile. In Uttara Ramayana Seetha's exile in the hermitage of 
Valmiki is for twelve years. So on...

[Commentary] Some others said that because Rama has not yet attained all the sixteen phases like full moon, 
he is not a full-fledged person, chaaru SoDashakalaasahitaH Again in saying:
raajiivalochana lotus-eyed one - petals of lotuses close down by night, so Rama's 
eyelids too close by night for a boyish sleep. Then how can such a boy war with night-active 
demons? In answer to this Sage Vishvamitra uses the same wording in previous chapter at 1-19-18,
dasharaatram; raamam raajiivalocanam where the wording raajiivalocana 
is used by Vishvamitra in the sense that the petals of a lotus spread out on the first rays 
of sun. So also the very opening of the lotus-petal eyelids of Rama will eradicate the nightly 
menace of demons with his Omniscient Sun-Moon-Fire eyes, suuryachandraagnilochanaH 
, that can see even in night.

[Commentary] A Kshatriya of sixteen years age is unfit to war with any one, as he is still a childhood
baalaH aaSoDashaavarSaH . But Rama is under sixteen, and he is being requisitioned 
for war. Can he combat even if he is under aged? Yes, he can, says Govindaraja as per the
nyaya /syndrome, tejasaam hi na vayaH samiikShyate 'dextrous person's age 
is not to be reckoned' As such, though Rama appears to be under aged he can do wonders in 
eliminating the vice. This is again rounded off with Vishvamitra's wording in last chapter:
aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam raajiivalocanam.

Shlok 3: "Here is the full-fledged battalion, called akShouhiNii senaa , 
for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter 
those demons. [1-20-3]

[Commentary] One pankti row, is the first unit of ancient military, which consists of 1 chariot, 
1 elephant, 3 cavalry, and 7-foot soldiers. Multiples of this first unit become an akShouhiNii 
troop, which consists of 21,870 chariots and the same number of elephants, 65,610 cavalry, 
and 1,09,350 of foot soldiers.

Shlok 4: "Brave and daring are these soldiers of mine, and as experts in weaponry they are the appropriate 
ones to combat the hordes of demons, but, it will be ungentle of you to take Rama with you. 
[1-20-4]

Shlok 5: "I alone with bow in my hand can protect your ritual, and as long as I bear my lives so long 
I war with those nightwalkers staying in the van of war. [1-20-5]

Shlok 6: " I myself wish to come over there thereby the works of ritual will be well-guarded and unimpeded, 
but, taking Rama with you will be ungracious of you. [1-20-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: "Why because, Rama is boy! And he is unschooled in his princely education; does he know the 
strengths and weaknesses of opponents - no; has he got the equipage of arsenal - no; has he 
any expertise in warfare - no; is he an equal to the demons - no; be that as it may, those 
demons definitely conduct a deceitful warfare, isn't it. [1-19-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Alienated from Rama I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, tigerly sage, hence taking 
Rama with you will be unjust. [1-20-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Otherwise, oh, Brahman with best vows, if you so wish to take Rama along with you, you lead 
him off along with me, and along with my four kinds of troops. [1-20-9b, 10a]

[Commentary] The four kinds of troops are: chariots, elephants, cavalry, and foot soldiers.

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Sixty thousand years have passed from my birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered 
at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate 
of you. [1-20-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "I will have exceptional affection for all of my four sons, isn't it, and among them Rama 
has a significance in the matter of his descent as an eldest son, hence taking Rama with you 
will be unjust of you. [1-20-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "Oh, eminent sage, of what fortitude are those demons? Whose sons are they? Who are they? 
How is their size and shape? Also who protects all of them? [1-20-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, Brahman, how Rama, or my forces, or I myself have to retaliate those demons that are 
deceitful militants. [1-20-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: "Tell me all that, oh, god, how I have to carry on when warring with those evil minded demons, 
for the demons will be delirious by their audacity, isn't it..." Thus Dasharatha asked Vishvamitra 
insistently. On hearing those words Sage Vishvamitra replied this way. [1-20-14b, 15]

Shlok 16- 17a: "One born in Paulastya dynasty, an extremely mighty and exceedingly brave demon named Ravana 
is there, and he with the boon given by Brahma, and accompanied with many other demons is 
torturing the triad of worlds, contemptuously. [1-20-16, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Unequivocally that chief of demons is the brother of Kubera and the son of sage Vishravasa, 
thus we hear. [1-20-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: "That formidable Ravana is not a devastator of rituals by himself, even so, two very mighty 
demons called Mareecha and Subaahu will cause devastating hindrances to rituals, instigated 
by him." Thus Sage Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-20-18b, 19]

Shlok 20: Thus when he is said so by that sage Vishvamitra, then the king Dasharatha spoke to the sage, 
"I myself am not capable of standing against that evil minded Ravana, in truth, where is the 
question of deputing my young Rama to confront him? [1-20-20]

Shlok 21: "You are the knower of probity, such as you are, you may please bestow benevolence upon my 
boyish son, as well on a less fortunate one like me too, and as our mentor you are indeed 
a god of ours. [1-20-21]

Shlok 22: "Gods, demons, celestial beings like gandharva-s, yaksha-s, winged and reptile beings 
are incapable to bear the brunt of that Ravana in fight, why tell again about humans. [1-20-22]

Shlok 23- 24a: "But that Ravana depletes the valour of valorous opponents in a battle, oh, eminent sage, 
either with my entire forces, or with all my sons I am inadequate to grapple with all his 
forces, or with him, individually. [1-20-23, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "My boyish son is godlike and unfledged in warfare, oh, Brahman, and he is the one who alleviates 
me from punnama naraka the hell of sonless fathers... no, I cannot 
spare my son in anyway. [1-20-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: "Further, those saboteurs of your ritual namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are similar to Death-god 
and the descendents of the earliest demons and subverters of rituals, namely Sunda and Upasunda, 
no, I cannot spare my son, in any case. [1-20-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27: "Mareecha and Subaahu are well-trained and valorous ones, hence I will proceed with all my 
friendly forces to war with either of those two demons, otherwise, I along with all my relatives 
implore upon you for your exoneration in my failure to comply my own promises. [1-20-26b, 
27]

Shlok 28: Thus, by the incongruous talk of Dasharatha, the outstanding Brahman and son of Sage Kushi, 
namely sage Vishvamitra is overwhelmed with outrageous anger by his mentation, and that fire-like 
glorious sage looked like the ritual fire into which many inflammable oblations are offered, 
and which is drenched with a lot of clarified butter, whereby it is flaring up its tongues. 
[1-20-28]



SARGA 21
------------------------------

[Text] The ire of sage Vishvamitra is shown at king Dasharatha. To pacify sage Vishvamitra, 
			sage Vashishta intervenes and convinces king Dasharatha to send Rama with sage 
			Vishvamitra. While doing so, sage Vashishta enumerates the capabilities of sage 
			Vishvamitra, his knowledge of weaponry. Vashishta also suggests that all those 
			weapons will be given to Rama, if Rama is dispatched with Vishvamitra. At last, 
			Dasharatha agrees to send Rama.

Shlok 1: On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, 
			Vishvamitra wrathfully replied this sentence to the king. [1-21-1]

Shlok 2: "On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate 
			it now, undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty. 
			[1-21-2]

Shlok 3: "If this is worth while to you, oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and 
			you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy with your kinsmen." So said 
			Vishvamitra to the king. [1-21-3]

Shlok 4: When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth 
			trembled and the gods are scared. [1-21-4]

Shlok 5: On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, 
			Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these 
			words to the king. [1-21-5]

Shlok 6: "Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, 
			a staunch one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it 
			will be unapt of you to forsake ethics." [1-21-6]

Shlok 7: "In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence 
			adhere to your own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt 
			of you. [1-21-7]

Shlok 8: "Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word 
			results in the perdition to the merits of iSTaapuurta 
			Vedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, leave hold of Rama. [1-21-8]

[Commentary] In some Vedic rituals activates for social service are undertaken, and they are 
			known as iSTaapuurta rituals, in which digging wells, lakes and other 
			social facilities will be undertaken.

Shlok 9: "Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long 
			as Kushi's son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects 
			divine nectar. [1-21-9]

[Commentary] In heaven an unapproachable firewall encircles the vessel of ambrosia protecting 
			it from thieving by the demons.

Shlok 10: "He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect 
			among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis. [1-21-10]

Shlok 11: "He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other person is there in the 
			triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable 
			about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself. 
			[1-21-11]

Shlok 12: "While Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, can anybody from sages - no; immortals- no; demons 
			- no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together with the kinnaraa-s and great 
			reptile beings - no, they cannot know him. [1-21-12]

Shlok 13: "All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaashva 
			Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva 
			gave them to Vishvamitra when was ruling kingdom. [1-21-13]

Shlok 14: "Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati's daughters and her husband 
			Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, 
			and victory-oriented missiles. [1-21-14]

Shlok 15: "Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists 
			gave birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme. [1-21-15]

Shlok 16: "On getting a boon Jaya named wife of Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty 
			best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for the destruction of ungodly 
			beings. [1-21-16]

Shlok 17: "Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another fifty unassailable, 
			unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators. [1-21-17]

Shlok 18: "And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this 
			principled one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles. [1-21-18]

Shlok 19: "Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, 
			who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either that has happened 
			or that is happening. [1-21-19]

Shlok 20: "Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has this sort 
			of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama's accompanying 
			the sage will be unapt of you. [1-21-20]

Shlok 21: "This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, 
			but intending to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring 
			upon you. [1-21-21]

Shlok 21: Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded 
			by sage Vashishta's words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has 
			pronounced renown, that Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to 
			the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra. [1-21-22]

[Text] King Dasharatha sends Rama and Lakshmana along with Sage Vishvamitra as requested 
			by the sage. In their course of travel, Sage Vishvamitra imparts a secret knowledge 
			to the young princes Rama and Lakshmana, called bala-atibala- 
			vidya-s, by practicing which nothing can wither their vigour and vitality.

Shlok 1: When Vashishta said that way king Dasharatha with an air of satisfaction personally 
			fetched Rama along with Lakshmana. [1-22-1]

Shlok 2: Rama is blessed for a propitious travel firstly by his mother Kausalya and then 
			by his father king Dasharatha, thereupon the royal priest Vashishta rendered Vedic 
			hymns blessing the journey, then Dasharatha well pleased in his heart of hearts 
			kissed his son Rama on forehead and entrusted him to Vishvamitra. [1-22-2, 3]

[Commentary] The mother is the first one to bless sons.
			
prathamam maatR^ikR^itama~Ngalapratipaadanena itarakR^itama~NgalaapekShayaa 
			maatR^ikR^itama~Ngalasya aavashyakataa vyatirekeNa anvayena ca suucitam

[Commentary] Duryodhana of Maha Bharata knows about this rule position and when he wanted to 
			gain victory over Pandava-s he approaches his mother Gandhari, seeking her blessings, 
			at first. vyatirekaH taavat paaNDavaan jetukaamo duryodhanaH - 
			shivam aashamsa me maataH 
			yudhyamaanasvashatrubhiH - iti aShTaadashaahaani svamaataram gaandhaariim 
			praarthitavaan | sa ca - yato dharmaH tato jayaH - iti vadantii ma~Ngalam na kurvatii 
			- dharmaakuutam When Duryodhana sought for his mother Gandhari's 
			blessings even for eighteen days, where eighteen is the particular number of Maha 
			Bharata, she said 'where there is virtue there will be victory'. Hence, mothers 
			are the first ones to bless sons in every enterprise, and here Rama's enterprise 
			as incarnate of Vishnu is commencing.

Shlok 5: Then on seeing the lotus-eyed Rama following Vishvamitra, dustless 
			and pleasant for touch breeze blew. [1-22-4]

Shlok 5: When the great-souled Rama forged ahead there occurred an abounding downpour of 
			flowers with the booming of divine drums, together with the boom and blare of 
			drums and conch-shells of Ayodhya. [1-22-5]

Shlok 6: Rama with jet-black hair-locks handling his bow followed Vishvamitra who walked 
			ahead, while Lakshmana handling his own bow followed Rama. [1-22-6]

Shlok 7: Rama and Lakshmana, with two quivers each and two bows in their hands, and making 
			all the ten directions of compass lambent followed Vishvamitra, as if three headed 
			serpents followed Vishvamitra, and with their highly dynamic physiques and spiritedness 
			they look as if like the Ashwin twin gods of unequal charm following Brahma, the 
			Forefather. [1-22-7]

[Commentary] Each one is having two quivers tied on each shoulder. Thus the upper portions 
			of the quivers with feathered shafts, with the tips of arrows inside, are giving 
			a picture of two more heads, on either side of the princes' heads. Thus Rama and 
			Lakshmana are appearing like three headed serpents. That is to say they are too 
			young with the size of their heads equalling the mouth of the quiver.

[Commentary] The meaning of As'vins from as'va a horse, Persian asp, Greek
			Î¹ÏÏÎ¿Ï Latin equus, Welsh *eck, is 
			Horsemen. They were twin deities of whom frequent mention is made in the Vedas 
			and the Indian myths. The As'vins have much in common with the Dioscuri of Greece, 
			and their mythical genealogy seems to indicate that their origin was astronomical. 
			They were, perhaps, at first the morning star and evening star. They are said 
			to be the children of the sun and the nymph As'vin, who is one of the lunar asterisms 
			personified. In the popular mythology they are regarded as the physicians of the 
			Gods. Gorresio/Griffith.

Shlok 8- 9- 10a: Those two youngsters with charming and bejewelled physiques are handling bows 
			and swords and their fingers have leathern covers. Both the unreprovable brothers 
			Rama and Lakshmana are highly resplendent and effulgent by their worth. While 
			they are following Vishvamitra they looked like the sons of Fire-god, namely Skanda 
			and Vishakha, following the great god with inscrutable potential, namely Shiva, 
			and thus the brothers have made Vishvamitra to shine forth in even pose with god 
			Shiva. [1-22-8, 9, 10a]

[Commentary] The Supreme Being that is resident like an atom. sthaa Being, aNum 
atom like. In every mobile or sessile being he is there. Here it is Shiva. Shiva's sons are 
two, one Ganesha and the other Kumara, of which Kumara is the Army General of Gods. According 
to Maha Bharata, Kumara is said to have become four in a split-second, known as 1- Skanda, 
2- Vishaakha, 3- Shaaka, 4- Naigamesha. Here the first two aspects of Kumara, namely Skanda 
and Vishaakha, are incorporated in simile to Rama and Lakshmana.

Shlok 10b- 11a: And on going one and half yojana distance Vishvamitra addressed Rama in a harmonious 
			voice calling, 'oh, Rama', on the southern riverbank of Sarayu. [1-22-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: " "Take water, my boy, and like that you receive a group of hymns,
			bala and atibala from 
			me, and let no time lapse. [1-22-11b, 12a]

[Commentary] Since the Vedic hymns cannot be taught after sunset, now it shall be evening time 
			before sunset, when oblations will be offered at sunset, and hence no time lapse 
			is envisaged. Govindaraja.

Shlok 12b- 13a: "On receiving these hymns neither tiredness nor fever, nor disfiguring of personality 
			can effect you, nor the demons can charge you either you are sleeping or unvigilant. 
			[1-11-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "As it is none whosoever on earth can equal you in dexterity, Rama, and by reciting 
			these hymns none can equal you in the three worlds. [1-22-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: "My dear Raghava, if bala atibala hymns are practised, oh, impeccable one, none 
			can equal you in the world by your handsomeness, calibre, erudition, by your discernment, 
			and even in replying or rebutting you. [1-22-14b, 15]

Shlok 16: "On receiving these two teachings there will be none similar to you, for bala 
			and atibala are the mothers of all knowledge. [1-22-16]

Shlok 17: "Oh, best one among men, Raghava, if you go on reciting bala and atiblala hymns, 
			my dear Rama, there will be no hunger or thirst to you. [1-22-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: "And if these twin teachings are practised an inestimable renown will also accrue, 
			oh, Raghu's legatee, these two hymns that possess brilliance are the daughters 
			of Forefather Brahma, and oh, Rama of Kakutstha, I intend to impart these hymns 
			to you, oh virtuous one, as you are the most eligible one, hence take the teachings 
			that are kept safe from the world. [1-22-18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Though all of these numerous qualities are undoubtedly available with you, that 
			too in abundance, yet these hymns if ascetically nurtured will yield various results." 
			Thus spoke Sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-22-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: Then Rama on touching water to purify himself received those teachings from the 
			contemplative soul Vishvamitra with gladness beaming on his face. [1-22-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22: Rama, the one with marvellous valiance, on obtaining those teachings performed 
			all his duties of a student in respect of a teacher and then shone forth like 
			the thousand rayed sun on a cloudless sky of autumn. Then those three very happily 
			stayed on the riverbank of Sarayu for that night. [1-22-21b, 22]

[Commentary] Here gurukaaryaaNi , are the duties demanded of a true disciple towards 
			a guru, who is his mantra-aachaarya, teacher according hymns. Without 
			performing these duties the studentship remains unfulfilled. These works are fetching 
			food for teacher, arranging his bed, pressing his sore-legs called paadasamvaahana 
			, etc. Rama does these services to any elderly person, more so to his father as 
			at this canto 1-18-28.

[Commentary] Throughout this chapter Vishvamitra addresses Rama alone to learn the hymns. It 
			may not be construed that Lakshmana is eliminated or avoided but he said to be 
			one with Rama when it comes to education. Thus these hymn are imparted to Lakshmana 
			also, not to Rama alone.

Shlok 24: Though both Rama and Lakshmana slept on an undeserving grass bed, nestled by the 
			comfortable words of Vishvamitra that night is as though pleasant to the noteworthy 
			children of Dasharatha. [1-22-24]



Sage Vishvamitra is the Seer for Gayatri hymn. He is the same Sage to impart balaatibala 
hymns to Rama and Lakshmana. For those readers that are interested to know or to practice, 
the Upanishad of balaatibala is included hereunder. This hymn is yet another 
aspect of Gayatri, and there is no hymn superior than Gayatri, na gaayatryaaH

SARGA 23
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana proceeding with Vishvamitra sojourn in a hermitage at a place where River 
Ganga and River Sarayu are confluent. Once god Shiva with his third eye burnt down the physical 
entity of Manmatha, the Love-god, at this place.

Shlok 1: At dawn after that night the great saint Vishvamitra spoke to the legatees of Kakutstha, Rama 
and Lakshmana, those that are sleeping on a grass bed. [1-23-1]

Shlok 2: "Fortunate is Kausalya to beget you as her son Rama... get up oh, tigerly-man, eastern aurora 
is emerging, daytime tasks towards gods are to be performed." [1-23-2]

[Commentary] This is another celebrated verse chanted even today. So far Rama is a dear prince to his parents. 
But here, no less than Sage Vishvamitra said to have deified Rama in asking him to 'get up' 
from divine trance to undertake the human duties to eliminate evil, like the dawn of the sun 
eliminating the evil darkness. In other ancient manuscripts the same verse obtains as:

[Commentary] This early morning 'awakening' of Vishnu or his incarnates from divine trance is a common 
practice in Vaishnavaite tradition, and is followed even today, called suprabhaata sevaa 
, morning service to wake up.

[Commentary] At the rising of the sun as well as at noon certain observances, invocations, and prayers 
were prescribed which might under no circumstances be omitted. One of these observances was 
the recitation of the sAvitri, [Gayatri, so to say,] a Vedic hymn to the Sun of wonderful 
beauty - Gorresio.

[Commentary] For kausalyaa suprajaa raama Griffith says: 'High fate is hers who calls thee son: 
/ Arise, 'tis break of day /. And Gita Press has it as: Kausalya is blessed with a worthy 
son [in you.]

Shlok 3: On hearing the benign words of the sage those valorous and best ones among men got up, bathed, 
and on offering water oblation they meditated upon the supreme hymn, namely Gayatri. [1-23-3]

[Commentary] Rama and Lakshmana meditated upon Gayatri hymn as there is no hymn superior to it;
na gaayatryaaH param japyam and this is also the usual hymn for water oblation at 
dawn or dusk: sandhyaa vandana . sandhyaa is the time between the day and 
night when the stars or the sun are not visible.
aho raatrasya yaH sandhiH suuryanakShatravarjitaH Then this hymn is 
to be meditated placing her in ones own heart or amid the solar system.
gaayatriim samsmaret dhiimaan hR^idi vaa suuryamaNDale.

Shlok 4: On performing their dawn time duties those two stalwarts, Rama and Lakshmana, enthusiastically 
presented themselves before the ascetically rich sage Vishvamitra for further journey, duly 
venerating him. [1-23-4]

Shlok 5: Then on travelling some more distance those two great valiant ones, there they have seen the 
divine river that courses in three ways, namely Ganga, at the auspicious confluence of River 
Sarayu. [1-23-5]

[Commentary] River Ganga follows three courses, firstly in heavens, second on earth, and third into nether 
worlds. These episodes on the descent of Ganga to earth are narrated in the later part of 
this book, Bala Kanda.

Shlok 6: There they have seen the merited hermitage of sages with contemplative souls, and who are 
practising supreme ascesis for many thousand years. [1-23-6]

Shlok 7: On seeing that merited hermitage Rama and Lakshmana are highly pleased and said this word 
to that great-soul Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-7]

Shlok 8: "Whose hermitage is this merited one? Indeed who is the celebrity that lives therein? Oh, 
godly sage, we are interested to listen, and we are truly inquisitive about it." Thus they 
asked. [1-23-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing their words the eminent sage Viswamitra said smilingly, " whose hermitage is this 
in earlier times that may be listened." Thus Vishvamitra started to narrate. [1-23-9]

Shlok 10- 11: "When Love-god was with his body wise men used to call him Kama, the passion. At this place, 
that Love-god with his naughty intent braved god of gods Shiva who had been practising ascesis 
and who concentrated observantly, and who was returning after his marriage along with his 
followers, namely the Wind-gods, and that great soul Shiva disapprovingly roared at Love-god. 
[1-23-10, 11]

[Commentary] The meaning of kandarpa is one who is carnally prideful, i.e., he who takes pride 
in arousing lecherousness. And kaama is 'desire' the natural basic instinct of any 
animal, and the one which the sages and saints want to overcome, so they named Love-god from 
their point of view. In these verses the two words kR^itodvaaham , and their meaning 
as on marrying Parvati and going this way with his coterie etc., is held incongruous to other 
mythological episodes of Shiva's marriage with Parvati, and Manmatha's effort to enkindle 
love in Shiva. After marriage with Parvati, some argue, where is the question of Love-god's 
interference to inculcate love in Shiva. It is clear in RamaCharitaMaanas how this Shiva-Parvati 
marriage occurs. And some give the meaning like this: kR^ita where kR^i= karaNe 
udvaaham tu devesham = to actualise, marriage, only, of Shiva; gacChantam on 
going there, Love-god, samarudgaNam with Wind-gods and other deities; dharSayaamaasa 
started to attack Shiva. The Love-god on going there to that hermitage that is being described 
by Vishvamitra along with Wind-gods et al, with an intention to get the marriage of Shiva 
performed, assailed Shiva.

Shlok 12: "And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his 
limbs to fall down from his body. [1-23-12]

[Commentary] The word avadhyataH is otherwise said in other texts as avadagdhasya raudreNa cakShuSaa, 
to derive a clear meaning of 'burnt down,' because avadhyataH is just killing, slaying, 
whereas Shiva's third-eye truly burns down anything where even ashes do not remain. The critical 
editions have this as dagdhasya tasya raudreNa chakShuShA

Shlok 13: "There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by 
the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity. [1-23-13]

[Commentary] Manmatha and his wife Rati will have supremely exquisite physiques. At the very sight of Manmatha 
everybody used to become a prey to lasciviousness. So Shiva had to completely burn down that 
physical form of love, whereby only kaama, the mental desire, is remaining.

Shlok 14: Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is 
given up that is renowned as Anga province. [1-23-14]

Shlok 15: "This merited hermitage thus belongs to Shiva and, oh, brave Rama, these sages abiding in 
virtue are Shiva's disciples at one time, thus sin is unverifiable with them. [1-23-15]

[Commentary] This hermitage belongs to Love God or Shiva, tasya kaamasya sthaaNorvaa. Because 
Shiva is a god who controls Love-god, kaameshvara, this is Shiva's hermitage. The 
last verse again says it is Kaama's hermitage. And the sages practising ascesis in this hermitage,
puraa shiSyaa , are the old time disciples of Shiva. puurvakaalam aarabhya...santaanaparamparayaa 
shiSyaa. These sages are the progeny of the sages who long time back were 
the direct disciples of Shiva. Because these are the direct grandchildren of the direct disciples 
of Shiva, sin cannot touch them. ata 
eva paapam teShaam na vidyate | puurvam rudrashiShyaa api samprati tat shiShyakR^itam paapam 
na vidyate ityarthaH|| Govindaraja.

Shlok 16: "Let us stay for this night in this hermitage situated in between two meritorious rivers Ganga 
and Sarayu, oh, Rama with auspicious mien, tomorrow we will cross over the River Ganga. [1-23-16]

Shlok 17- 18a: "Let us all purify ourselves by taking our bath, performing our meditations, offering our 
daily oblations, and then let us enter this meritorious hermitage, thus our stay in here will 
be comforting to us." So said Vishvamitra to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-23-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: When they are discussing there the sages of that hermitage are highly gladdened to perceive 
them with their sixth-sense, and on approaching them enchantedly they offered water for hands 
and feet wash and then offered hospitality firstly to Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-18, 19]

Shlok 20: Afterwards those sages of that hermitage have accorded reception to Rama and Lakshmana, and 
applauded by Vishvamitra for their hospitality those sages have entertained Rama and other 
guests with myths and legends. [1-23-20]

Shlok 21: Those sages with concentrated minds and according to one's own aptitude have meditated upon 
the deity of sunset when it is sundown, followed by Rama and others. Then led into hermitage 
by those sages who are with pious commitments and who are dwelling there, Rama and others 
have very comfortably stayed in the precincts of Shiva's hermitage. [1-23-21]

Shlok 22: Staying very comfortably in the precincts of Kaama hermitage, 
then that virtuous sage Vishvamitra, saint the eminent, delighted the delightful princes with delighting stories.....[1-23-22]



SARGA 24
------------------------------

[Text] While crossing over the River Ganga, sage Vishvamitra sails them through its confluence with 
River Sarayu, which flows at their capital Ayodhya. The sage leads them to a deadly forest 
on the other bank of River Ganga and narrates about the ambushing nature of demoness Tataka, 
preparing him to kill her.

Shlok 1: Then, in the fresh of the morning those enemy destroyers, Rama and Lakshmana, arrived at the 
riverbank of Ganga keeping sage Vishvamitra ahead of them, which sage has just completed his 
ritualistic chores of dawn. [1-24-1]

Shlok 2: All those sages of Kaama's hermitage that are the great souls and scrupulous ones in their 
vows, have positioned an auspicious ferryboat within the reach in the river, and then they 
said to sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-2]

Shlok 3: "You may board the boat keeping the princes ahead of you, and we wish you to proceed on a 
prosperous route without the shift of time." So said the sages. [1-24-3]

Shlok 4: Sage Vishvamitra on saying 'it must be so,' to those sages and revering them in his turn, 
cruised the river that itself is cruising towards ocean, along with both the princes. [1-24-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: On coming to the midstream of water there Rama heard an unusual and increasing noise of gushy 
waters along with his younger brother, and that brilliant one Rama desired to know its significance. 
[1-24-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Rama then asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra in the midst of the river, "what is this turbulent 
sound sire, as though slashing water?" [1-24-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On hearing the inquisitive words of Raghava that virtue-souled sage Vishvamitra started to 
tell the significance of that sound. [1-24-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "On Mt. Kailash Brahma created a great lake at his will, oh, tigerly-man Rama, hence that 
is called Maanasa Lake. [1-24-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10- 11a: "That river which spontaneously flows out of that Maanasa Lake surrounds Ayodhya city is this 
one, the River Sarayu. Because this has originated from a lake, saraH, 
this is known as Sarayu. And because it flows from Brahma's Lake it is a merited river. This 
is the remarkable noise of such a Sarayu River in its coursing towards River Ganga, generated 
by the collision of their waters, and Rama, offer regards to these rivers, respectfully." 
So said Vishvamitra to the princes. [1-24-9b, 10, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: Offering their salutations to River Sarayu and Ganga those two most virtuous and agile footed 
princes proceeded further on reaching the southern riverbank. [1-24-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: On seeing a horrendous and uninhibited forest, Rama, the son of the best king Dasharatha asked 
the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, impenetrable is this forest fraught with swarms of crickets, brutish predators, and vultures, 
which are all horribly strident. [1-24-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Various vultures are screeching with fierce sonority, and tigers, wild boars, and elephants 
render this forest atypical. [1-24-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Indeed, what is this wretched forest that is dense with Dhava, Ashvakarna, Arjuna, Bilva, 
Tinduka, Patala, and Badari trees." Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-24-15b, 16a]

[Commentary] The botanical names of the trees mentioned in the text are Grislea Tormentosa, Shorea Robusta, 
Echites Antidysenterica, Bignonia Suaveolens, Aegle Marmelos, and Diospyrus Glutinosa. I have 
omitted the Kutaja (Echites) and the Tinduka (Diospyrus). Griffith.

Shlok 16b- 17a: The resplendent and the great saint Vishvamitra then said to Rama, "I will tell you, oh, my 
boy Rama, whose is this wretched forest. [1-24-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Once these were vast provinces, oh, best one among men, designed by gods and known as Malada 
and Karuusha. [1-24-17b, 18a]

[Commentary] The word malada is malam dyati khaNDayati iti malada that which abolishes 
excreta, but not filth itself. karuuSha is remover of hunger. 
If mortal hunger is there excreta will be there and then mortality of Indra is at stake. Hence 
if hunger is eliminated there will be nothing filthy. Once these provinces were such hunger 
removers equalling to heaven, but deteriorated in their heaven-on-earth attributes, owing 
to demoness Tataka.

Shlok 18b- 19a: "Once upon a time, oh, Rama, mortal impurities of filth and hunger completely stained Indra 
when he eliminated demon Vritra, as he committed the sin of killing of a Brahman, where the 
demon Vritra was incidentally a Brahman. [1-24-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "The gods and ascetically rich sages then started to bathe feculent Indra with their handy 
vessels for the riddance of his defilement. [1-24-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "On giving filth and hunger emerged out of the body of Mahendra here on the earth then the 
gods were gladdened. [1-24-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: "As and when Indra was without desecration and hunger as well, and thus purified, then gladdened 
about this place he gave it an unexcelled boon. [1-24-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: "These provinces that bear the impurity of my body shall become resourceful and they shall 
attain renown in world as Malada and Karusha." Thus Indra gave boon to this place. [1-24-22b, 
23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "On observing the honour accorded by wise Indra to these places gods praised the controller 
of demon Paaka, namely Indra saying, 'splendid, splendid it is.' [1-24-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b- 25a: "For a long time these habitations Malada and Karuusha were affluent, oh, enemy subjugator 
Rama, and people were happy with wealth and provisions. [1-24-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26- 27a: "Later at sometime, a yaksha female who is a guise changer at her wish, possessor of the strength 
of a thousand elephants, wife of clever Sunda, and she whose son is demon Mareecha, the 
one equal to Indra in his bravery, prevailed here, let you be safe Rama. [1-24-25b, 26, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: "That demon Mareecha is round shouldered, huge headed, cavernous mouthed, and gigantic bodied 
one, and he is always terrifying the people. [1-24-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: "And Raghava, that malevolent Tataka is always destroying the inhabitations at Malada and 
Karusha. [1-24-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: "She lives about one and half yojana distance from here, and by which reason this became the 
forest of Tataka, owing to her gruesome activities, for that reason only a headway is to be 
made, to eradicate her and her activities. [1-24-29b, 30a]

[Commentary] This verse also means 'where there is the forest of Tataka there we have to go.' The above 
is another shade of that verse.

Shlok 30b- 31a: "Depending upon the strength of your own self-confidence you have to eradicate this evildoer, 
and assigned by me you have to make this province free from thorniness. [1-24-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] Great persons accomplish their deeds by their self-confidence, kriyaasiddhiH sattve bhavati 
mahataam, nopakaraNe not by their hardware.

Shlok 31b- 32a: "Indeed, none is able to enter this sort of province, Rama, destroyed by the hazardous 
and invincible unearthly being who turned into a demoness, namely Tataka, hence you have to 
make the provinces habitable. [1-24-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32: "As to how that ghoulish Tataka destroyed this entire forest, rendering it as a devastated 
place, without refraining from it even today, all that is narrated." So said Vishvamitra to 
Rama. [1-24-32]

[Commentary] The epithets used in epic may be on the increase from now, and 
they may not be construed as redundant foot fillers. All have implicit meanings and they can be 
understood with the help of commentaries. As this work cannot include voluminous commentaries, many 
of the meanings of epithets as said by commentators are not incorporated. This bypassing will not 
effect the ordinary narration. For e.g., the meaning to the words munipungava, narashaarduula
will be 'the eminent saint' 'tigerly man'. And trying to obtain a squeezed meaning from them 
would be futile, without resorting to some commentary. So also, there are words like indra, 
candra, simha, shaarduula, naaga, vR^iSabha, pungava which when suffixed to vocatives will mean 
'best, choicest, excellent' etc., as per simha-shaarduula-naagaadyaaH pumsi shreSTaarthagocharaaH 
. But commentators have explained why that character is 'best or excellent, or a lion' 
at that juncture. For e.g., dharmaatmaathe apparently usual epithet in Ramayana has many 
meanings like â 1] one whose life is dharma; 2] one whose body is dharma incarnate; 3] one whose 
soul is filled with dharma; 4] one whose entity itself is dharma â so on, basing on the thesaurus of
aatmathat say as: aatmaa yatna-dhR^iti-svaanta-svabhaava-paramaatmaasu jiiva-buddhi- 
shariireSu..

[Commentary] So also, more than often Seetha will be referred as Vaidehi or 
Maithili in Aranya Kanda. Some details about it are incorporated in that book. Wherever possible 
those niceties will be included subject to availability of commentaries, which commentaries have 
already became 'the flowers in the sky.'

[Commentary] Hence, without trying to squeeze meaningless meanings, and leaving this aspect to pundits and 
researchers, and as this work cannot be stuffed with those intricacies, henceforth the meanings of 
epithets are said simply, and at times ignored also. This may please be kept in view while reading.



SARGA 25
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra narrates the birth, marriage and curse of demoness Tataka, and bids Rama 
to eliminate her menace without any hesitation of killing a female, for she is atrocious towards 
the society.

Shlok 1: On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the tigerly man Rama 
replied him with estimable words. [1-25-1]

Shlok 2: "It is said that yaksha's strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how 
then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants? [1-25-2]

Shlok 3- 4: On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence 
to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, 
"Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the 
bestowal of a boon. [1-25-3, 4]

Shlok 5: "Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout 
conduct performed a great ascesis. [1-25-5]

Shlok 6: "Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who 
is renowned by the name of Tataka. [1-25-6]

Shlok 7: "Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly 
remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous. 
[1-25-7]

Shlok 8: "When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to 
Jambha's son Sunda as wife. [1-25-8]

Shlok 9: "Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who 
by curse became a demon. [1-25-9]

Shlok 3: "But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya's curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate 
that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha. [1-25-10]

Shlok 11- 12a: "With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him 
away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya 
firstly cursed Mareecha saying, 'you will attain demon-hood.' [1-25-11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13: "Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, 'forthwith divested of this form 
of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, 
face contorted, and shape monstrous.' [1-25-12b, 13]

Shlok 14: "Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious 
province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered. [1-25-14]

Shlok 15: "She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall 
eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows. [1-25-15]

Shlok 16: "Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, 
Raghu's legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her. [1-25-16]

Shlok 17: "Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since 
a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society. [1-25-17]

Shlok 18: "For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either 
it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying. [1-25-18]

Shlok 19: "To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, 
the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn't it. 
[1-25-19]

Shlok 20: "Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the 
daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven't we. [1-25-20]

Shlok 21: "And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya's mother 
when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra. [1-25-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females 
who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, 
by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her." Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama 
regarding Tataka's elimination. [1-25-22]

[Commentary] This is a much
  discussed topic in Ramayana. Rama's adventures start with the killing of a female. While
  scriptures say that killing a female is sinful, is this killing of a female righteous or wrongful
   is the topic for discussion. It is said in answer that there is no harm to dharma since
  unrighteousness is eliminable though existing in the form of a female.
  duShTastriivadhe doSho naastiiti shaastreNa na anyena - dharmaakuutam ||
And ViShNu Purana
  says that eliminating one evildoer for the sake of many innocent is neither sin nor a crime  of
  course, to the kings and rulers: yasmin atra
  nidhanam praapte duShTakaariNi | bahuunaam bhavati kShemaH tasya puNyaprado vadhaH || - viShNu
  puraana 1-13-73-74
For the sake many, that too defenceless rural people, it is the duty
  of the king to eliminate whether it is a male or a female if involved in atrocities: 
  dharmaarthapuurvakam taaTakaavadhe doSho naasti -   --  puNyam 
	eva bhaviShyati iti taatparyeNa maharShivishvaamitreNa uktam | idaaniimtanairapi

SARGA 26
------------------------------

[Text] Rama encounters his first problem-female demoness Tataka, also called as Taadaka, 
and eliminates her at the orders of sage Vishvamitra. This is a crucial test put 
to Rama by Vishvamitra in ascertaining whether Rama is the follower of dharma through 
elder men's orders or not. Rama eradicates Tataka basing on his own self-confidence.

Shlok 1: On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best 
man's son who is firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage. 
[1-26-1]

Shlok 2: "Upon my father's order, upon my honour to my father's word, and looking upon this 
as the word of sage Kushi's son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented. 
[1-26-2]

[Commentary] The third consideration is 'teacher's words' itarairapi gurushaasane sati avishankayaadharmyam 
api tad uktam avashyam kartavyam iti suucitam - dharmaakuutam hence, 
Rama cannot be heedless of the words of both his father and teacher.



"What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, 
that word too cannot be disregarded. [1-26-3]

[Commentary] Dasharatha bade Rama to do whatever assigned by Vishvamitra. Here Vishvamitra is 
assigning something ambiguous. Hence the dilemma between two instructions of two 
elderly people, and thus scriptures and practise confuse the young.

Shlok 4: "Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according 
as the follower of father's words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma 
scholar, such as your are, without a doubt. [1-26-4]

[Commentary] Here Rama is in the same predicament as Arjuna in Maha Bharata. Arjuna's dilemma 
is to kill his own relatives, where Rama's is to kill a female at this juncture. 
What Krishna preaches in entire Bhagavad Gita is told in nutshell by sage Vishvamitra, 
i.e., 'do your duty as a Kshatriya, the ruling class, and protect virtue and eradicate 
vice, whether it is in the form of females or relatives.' atha vishvaamitro 
guruH - tasya vacanam avicaareNa kartavyam - evam sati dasharathena api - kaushiko

ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava. [1-26-29b, 30a]

[Commentary] These are the sons like missiles of Krishaashva Prajaapati. About them, the divine 
weaponry and their birth, c.f. 21st sarga/chapter, verse 10 to 20.

Shlok 30b- 31a: "Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver 
of those missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods. 
So said gods to Vishvamitra. [1-26-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned

we will go to that hermitage of mine. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-26-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: On listening sage Vishvamitra's words, Dasharatha's son Rama, comfortably stayed 
that night there in that forest of Tataka. [1-26-34]

Shlok 35b: On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and 
it shone forth like the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha. 
[1-26-35b, c]

Shlok 36: Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete 
elimination of yaksha's daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage 
only to be awakened by the next day's sunrise. [1-26-36]

[Commentary] The materialists view this episode as a function of Rama in eradicating natural 
calamities like dust storms, pellet storms in an uncultivable land, on the line 
of the episode of Ahalya. In this episode Rama's discipline is also tested. Whether 
he simply follows what is instructed or whether he uses his own discretion, is the 
topic here. Rama coupled both and eradicates Tataka, tough he doubts for a while 
whether to eliminate a female.

striivadhaH sahasaa na kartavyaH viruupakaraNaadi striidaNDanam eva 
prathamataH kriyate â dharmaakuutam

[Commentary] This is required for the endowment of deadly missiles 
to Rama in coming chapters. Hence Vishvamitra asks Rama to depend upon his own self-confidence 
to undertake this deed as at 1-24-30b, 31a. On satisfying with the eligibility of 
Rama to receive missiles with this episode, Vishvamitra accords those deadly weapons 
later.



SARGA 27
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra satisfied with the behaviour of Rama in obliging the 
			orders of elders and performing the act that is assigned to him, gives 
			many weapons to Rama, called shastra, astra-s. 
			The weaponry is categorised mainly into two types. One is
			shastra - a handheld weapon like sword, 
			lance or mace. The other is astra - a projectile 
			missile invoked by reciting hymns. This chapter lists out those missiles 
			that are given to Rama and in next chapter an account of some counter-attack 
			missiles, called upasamhaaraastra-s is 
			given which can be used to nullify the enemy's missiles. In the endnote 
			of this chapter some verses describing the nature of
			astra-s are incorporated.

Shlok 1: Then, on staying that night there in Tataka forest, on the next day 
			morning the greatly renowned sage Vishvamitra, smilingly and wording 
			sweetly spoke to Rama. [1-27-1]

Shlok 2: "I am highly pleased with you, oh, illustrious prince Rama, let safety 
			be with you, I will now give you all of the divine missiles in utmost 
			fondness of mine. [1-27-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: "I am going to accord all of those divine missiles by which scores of 
			gods, demons, or even from gandharva-s, uragaa-s and the like, or even 
			earthlings are dominated, humbled down and conquered in war. Let safety 
			be with you. [1-27-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5- 6- 7a: "Raghava, I am going to give the highly divine Danda disc [Punisher 
			disc]; next, oh, best one among men, Dharma disc [Virtue-disc,] and 
			like that kaala disc [Time-disc]; then oh, brave one, Vishnu disc; similarly 
			oh, dextrous Rama, Indra disc and Thunderbolt missile; the best trident 
			pertaining to Shiva; the missile called Brahma-shira [Brahma-crest]; 
			the missile called the Aishiika missile [Grass-Blade missile,] and that 
			way oh, Raghava, I am going to give the unexcelled and highly formidable 
			missile called Brahma missile. [1-27-4b, 5, 6, 7a]

[Commentary] aiSiika missile is dried blade of grass, which by invoking with hymns 
			will become a projectile weapon. Rama uses on Kakasura. In Mahaa Bharata 
			Ashvatthaama also uses this at the final stage of war, which Krishna 
			nullifies.

Shlok 7b- 8a: "Oh manly tiger prince Rama, I am going to accord two maces that are 
			brilliant by their radiance called, the Modaki, [the Beater,] and Shikhari, 
			[the Tower of Protection.] [1-27-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: "Oh, Rama, like that I will be giving three nooses called Dharma paasha 
			and kaala-paasha and Varuna paasha, [Virtue noose and Time noose, Rain 
			god's noose] as well as an unequalled missile called Varuna astra, Rain-god's 
			missile. [1-27-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: "Oh, Raghu's scion, I will also give two projectile bolts, one called 
			shushka [The Drier] and the other aardra [The Drencher] and even 
			the missiles of Pinaaka and that of Narayana, [the missiles of god Shiva 
			and Narayana] I will give. [1-27-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Oh, impeccable Rama, thus a well-known missile shikhari [The Tower] 
			and another the fond of Fire-god known as prathama [The Blower] and 
			a missile of Air-god too, I will be giving. [1-27-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Oh, Raghava of Kakutstha-s, I will give you two missiles named Haya-shira 
			[The Horse-head] and Krouncha [The Wrester] and two Impellers, one 
			presided over by the power of Vishnu, and the other by the power of 
			Rudra. [1-27-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "I will be giving all those weapons that are wielded by demons, namely 
			the deadly Pounder named Kankaalam, and Rods named as Kapaalam and Kankanam, 
			for the elimination of those very demons. [1-27-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: "Oh, mighty armed son of the best king, I am giving a great missile 
			named Vaidyadhara by its name, and a gem of sword named Nandana. [1-27-13b, 
			14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Thus, the missile which is very much liked by Gandharva-s, namely Mohana, 
			[The Stupefier,] the missile called Prasvapana [The Inducer of Sleep,] 
			and the gentle Prashamana [The Pacifier of enemy's anger.] [1-27-14b, 
			15a]

Shlok 15b- 16- 17: "Oh, highly fortunate Rama, take these missiles namely, varshaNa, [the 
			Rainer,] shoshana [the Drainer,] santaapana [the Humidifier,] vilaapana 
			[the Weep-inducer,] and oh, prince, an unassailable intoxicator and 
			a dear missile of Manmatha, namely Mohana [The Intoxicator,] and another 
			the fond missile of gandharva-s namely maanava by its name, [The Humane 
			missile,] and oh, tigerly man, a missile dear one to pishaaca-s, monsters, 
			namely paishaca [The Monster missile.] [1-27-15, 16, 17]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19- 20: "Oh, manly-tiger Rama, greatly powered taamasa and saumana missiles, 
			the indomitable missiles like samvarta, mausala, satya, and then the 
			maaya-maya missile; like that oh, mighty armed Rama, a solar missile 
			the sequestrator of others' brilliance namely teja-prabha; next, the 
			missile of Moon-god named shishira [The Cooler]; and a very deadly missile 
			of tvaSTa namely sudaamana; and even the dangerous missile of bhaga 
			namely shita-iSu, these and the maanava missile of Manu, the earliest 
			ruler of mankind, I will be giving. [1-27-17b, 18, 19, 20]

Shlok 21: "These missiles are, oh, dextrous prince, disguise-wizards, greatly 
			powered, and highly providential ones, oh, Rama, you may take them forthwith." 
			So said sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-27-21]

Shlok 22: That pre-eminent sage Vishvamitra on performing his personal holy depuration 
			then gave the assortment of extraordinary hymns to Rama facing eastward. 
			[1-27-22]

Shlok 23: The comprehension of which invoking hymns of the missiles is impossible 
			even to gods with their sections and subsections of procedures, that 
			Brahman dedicated such hymns to Raghava. [1-27-24]

Shlok 24: While that intelligent saint Vishvamitra chanted the hymns, all of those 
			highly venerable missiles came nigh and stood accessible to Raghava 
			in their astral form. [1-27-24]

Shlok 25- 26a: All of those highly obliging missiles in astral bodies, gladdening to 
			come under the aegis of Rama, then spoke to him making palms-fold, "here 
			are your thralls, Sire, we are here to accomplish whatever you bid us 
			to do, let safety be with you." So said the deities presiding over the 
			missiles to Rama. [1-27-25]

Shlok 26b- 27: On receiving them with a pleased heart, then Rama patted them with his 
			palm, and that Rama of Kakutstha-s also spoke this way to those mightily 
			forceful missiles in ethereal bodies saying, "you may manifest yourselves 
			in my cognisance whenever I need you," and he motivated them to take 
			leave and to come back at his beck and call. [1-27-26b, 27]

Shlok 28: That highly resplendent Rama revered sage Vishvamitra with a thankful 
			heart and readied himself for further journey. [1-27-26]

[Commentary] There are some verses that depict the nature 
of these astra-s. A few of them are given under. Though we may not actually acquire 
a projectile power with these verses, they may at least detail what these missiles 
are. The source of these verses is untraceable, but they are said to be in puraaNaa-s, 
and Shiva informs Sage Narada, about the missiles as below:

[Commentary] "It contains air, fire and cosmic poison, 
two goat-like fangs, full of poison, weighty, emits air, contains mercury, fiery, 
sparkling, sky is filled with air, enemy-killing, greatly radiant and it is projected 
with three hymns, Gayatri at its centre, it is known as brahma-astra



SARGA 28
------------------------------

[Text] Rama requests sage Vishvamitra for endowing annulment missiles, besides 
			projectile ones that have been accorded in the previous chapter. Sage 
			Vishvamitra accords them, and while they are journeying further, they 
		
			chance to see a picturesque forest on their way and Rama enquires about 
			it.

Shlok 1: On becoming personally purified Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha-s, 
			received the missiles, and then on their way he is now speaking to Sage 
			Vishvamitra with a pleasant face. [1-28-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, godly sage, I have taken the missiles and became unassailable even 
			for gods, but oh, eminent sage, I wish to know the annulment of missiles 
			too." So said Rama to the sage. [1-28-2]

Shlok 3: When Rama of Kakutstha said thus, next that resolute, well-averred and 
			purified sage of eminence Vishvamitra imparted the knowledge of annulment 
			missiles. [1-28-3]

Shlok 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9- 10: "Oh, Raghava, take these radiant missile-children of Krishaasva from 
			me, namely Satyavanta, Satyakeerti, Dhristha, Rabhasa, Pratihaaratara, 
			Paraanmuka, Avaanmukha, Lakshya, Alakshya, Dhridhanaabha, Sunaabha, 
			Dashaaksha, Shatavaktra, Dashasheersha, Shatodara, Padmanaabha, Mahaanaabha, 
			Dundunaabha, Svanaabha, Jyotisha, Shakuna, Nairaashya, Vimala, Yaugandhara, 
			Vinidra, Daitya, Pramadhana, Suchibaahu, Mahaabaahu, Nishkali, Viruchi, 
			Saarchirmaali, Dhritirmaali, Vrittiman, Ruchira, Pitrya, Saumanasa, and 
			also thus Vidhoota, Makara, are two of them...Karaveerakara, Dhana, 
			Dhaanya, Kaamaroopa, Kaamaruchi, Moha, Aavarana, and thus Jrimbhaka, 
			Sarvanaabha, Varana... and these are the guise changing wizards and you 
			are the eligible one to handle these missiles, let safety be with you." 
			Thus Vishvamitra gave missiles to Rama. [1-28-4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Shlok 11- 12- 13: Gladdening in his heart of hearts Rama of Kakutstha received the annulment 
			missiles saying, "Agreed! Sire!" Those missiles are with radiantly divine 
			bodies, appealing and endowing bliss. Some are fire-like, some smoke-like, 
			and some moon-like and some sun-like, and such as they are, some of 
			them holding out their hollowed palms, and some with palms adjoined 
			melodiously spoke to Rama saying, "here we are, oh, tigerly man, what 
			can we do for you." [1-28-11, 12, 13]

Shlok 14: "While remaining in my memory you assist me as and when needed, and 
			till then you may go away as you wish," thus that legatee of Raghu-s said 
			to those deities of annulment missiles. [1-28-14]

Shlok 15: Saying "it will be done that way" to Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha-s, 
			also on performing circumambulation to him and then on taking his consent 
			those deities have gone away as they have come. [1-28-15]

Shlok 16: After learning the nullifying missiles and then while proceeding on 
			the walkway Raghava asked the great sage Vishvamitra with sweet and 
			soft words. [1-28-16]

Shlok 17- 18: "What is this cloudlike picturesque thicket shining forth not very far 
			away on this side of mountain, with animals spreading over it, and embellished 
			with numerous kinds of birds that have pleasant callings it is highly 
			soul-delighting, thus, my inquisitiveness is growing very much to know 
			it, what is this, really! [1-28-17, 18]

Shlok 19- 20a: "By the nature of happy environs at this place, oh, eminent sage, I 
			understand that we have come out of the extremely alarming forest of 
			Tataka, but oh, god, whose hermitage's threshold is this, kindly tell 
			me all. [1-28-19]

Shlok 20b- 21- 22: "Oh, great saint, where are those murderers of Brahmans? Oh, venerable 
			one, at which place those evil minded sinners and evildoers will be 
			coming to hinder your ritual? And where, oh, Brahman, I have to safeguard 
			your ritual ceremonies, and demons too are to be eliminated? Oh, eminent 
			sage, what is that place? I would like to hear all of it." Rama asked 
			Vishvamitra in that way. [1-28-20b, 21, 22]



SARGA 29
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana inquisitively enquired into the Siddhaashrama, 
			Accomplished Hermitage in the earlier chapter for which Sage Vishvamitra 
			informs about the heritage of that hermitage for it once belonged to 
			Vishnu in Vaamna incarnation. Vishvamitra narrates about it and how 
			Vaamna, a dwarfish ascetic boy eradicated evil on earth. It is a suggestion 
			to Rama from Sage Vishvamitra to do likewise in this incarnation of Rama also.

Shlok 1: When that matchlessly illustrious Rama has asked for details, that highly 
			resplendent sage Vishvamitra started to narrate about that forest to 
			Rama. [1-29-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "Here, oh, dextrous Rama, he who is worshipped by gods and who has got 
			outstanding ascesis that Vishnu resided here in the pursuit of practising 
			ascesis and yoga for good many years, likewise for a hundred eras. [1-29-2, 
			3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: "This is the erstwhile hermitage of great-souled Vaamana renowned as 
			Accomplished hermitage, why because the sage with supreme ascesis Kaashyapa 
			got accomplishment to such of his ascesis there only. [1-29-3b, 4a]

[Commentary] This is firstly the hermitage of Vishnu before taking up Vaamna incarnation. 
			Later the incarnate Vaamna also practised asceticism here. Thus, this 
			hermitage belongs to both Vishnu and Vaamna, and on such an analogy 
			this even belongs to Rama at the present time, so says Vishvamitra at 
			24th verse below.

Shlok 4b- 5: "In the meantime, when Vishnu was in his asceticism in this hermitage, 
			the son of King Virochana, namely Bali, has completely conquered all 
			the assemblages of gods together with Indra and his coterie called Wind-gods, 
			and ruling that kingdom where that hermitage is there, he has become 
			renowned in all the three worlds for his magnanimity. [1-29-4b, 5]

[Commentary] Bali is generally addressed Bali Chakravatri, Bali, The Emperor, for 
			his grand benevolence. He is the grand son of Prahlaada, who in turn 
			is the son of greatest demon king, HiraNyakashapa, who was eliminated 
			by Vishnu, in His Nara-simha, Man-Lion incarnation.

Shlok 6: "That great mighty chief of demons Bali then conducted a very grand 
			Vedic ritual. But when Bali is conducting that ritual remaining as its 
			officiator all the gods personally approached Vishnu, keeping Fire-god 
			ahead of them, just here in this hermitage and they spoke to him. [1-29-6]

Shlok 7: " 'Oh, all-pervading god Vishnu, Bali the son of Virochana is conducting 
			an unsurpassed Vedic ritual, before the completion of which our own 
			mission, say the task of gods, is to be achieved completely. [1-29-7]

Shlok 8: " 'Whoever the supplicant might be and from wherever he might be coming, 
			but if one approaches and supplicates to him he is donating that in 
			as is where is condition, whatever is supplicated and wherever it might 
			be. [1-29-8]

Shlok 9: " 'As such, oh, Vishnu, you may effectuate the most suitable merited 
			deed for the welfare of gods on resorting to your illusory power, Vishnu 
			Maya, and on assuming the form of a dwarf to deal with Emperor Bali.' 
			Thus gods appealed to Vishnu. [1-29-9]

Shlok 10: "In the meanwhile, oh Rama, he whose brilliance is similar to ritual 
			fire, who will be with his wife Lady Aditi, who is resplendent with 
			his own vitality, that godly sage Kaashyapa on completing his asceticism 
			along with Lady Aditi started to eulogise the boon giver and the eliminator 
			of demon Madhu, namely Vishnu." Thus Vishvamitra is narrating to Rama. 
			[1-29-10, 11]

[Commentary] The ascetic practises conducted along with wife are said to yield best 
			results, in the case of a desired object of that couple's interest. 
			Therefore, Dasharatha also conducted the ritual to beget progeny along 
			with his wives. Here Sage Kaashyapa conducted his austerities along 
			with wife Aditi.

Shlok 12: " 'Oh, Supreme Person, you are abounding with asceticism, aggregate 
			of asceticism, the aspect of asceticism, and the very soul of asceticism, 
			such as you are, I am able to see you with the well practised asceticism 
			of mine. [1-29-12]

[Commentary] The word 'tapaH' also means j~naana, gnosis, knowledge, intellect, spirit, 
			as such it is oriented that way and said as, "oh, Vishnu, you are abounding 
			with intellect, aggregate of intellect, the only aspect of intellect..." 
			etc.

Shlok 13: " 'In your physique I am seeing this entire universe, oh, god, and you 
			are without a beginning and indefinable, and in you I am taking shelter.' 
			Sage Kaashyapa praised Vishnu in this way. [1-29-13]

[Commentary] This is the concept of vishvaruupa, Physique of the Universes, 
			which Krishna shows to Arjuna in Maha Bharata at the time of telling 
			Bhavad Gita.

Shlok 14: Vishnu is gladdened for the devotion of sage Kaashyapa who is absolved 
			of any blemish in his ascesis, and then Vishnu said this to, "You may 
			seek a boon as you are boon-worthy, I opine that you are a preferred 
			one to me, let safety be with you." Thus Vishnu said to Kaashyapa. [1-29-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: On hearing the word of Vishnu sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mariicha 
			said, "oh, god the accorder of boons, as you are pleased with us it 
			will be apt of you to bestow the boon besought by Lady Aditi and the 
			gods, oh, lord with lofty vows, for which boon I am also supplicating 
			to you, following them. [1-29-15, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17: " 'Oh, god, oh, sinless one, you may please attain the sonship of Lady 
			Aditi and myself, oh, dispenser of demons, it will be apt of you to 
			render help to gods who are agonised in the anguish owing to the predominance 
			of Emperor Bali, by becoming the younger brother of Indra. [1-29-16b, 
			17]

Shlok 18: " 'Oh, god of gods, as the works of my austerities are accomplished 
            here, by your grace this hermitage will be renowned by the name Siddhaashram, 
            Hermitage of Accomplishment, hence oh god, arise from here to 
			become my son.' So said sage Kaashyapa to Vishnu. [1-29-18]

[Commentary] The wording siddhe karmaNi is interpreted in two ways. One 
			in respect of Vishnu who is practising asceticism there, as His austerities 
			are accomplished here in accepting request of gods as well as that of 
			Sage Kaashyapa. The other, in respect of Kaashyapa who is seeking the 
			boon, and if Vishnu accords the boon to incarnate Himself as Vaamna 
			in the womb of Aditi, the austerities of Kaashyapa are also accomplished. 
			Since the deeds of Supreme God are not accomplished with mere austerities, 
			but by eliminating the evil, the concept of siddhe karmaNi 
			is appropriate in respect of Sage Kaashyapa. In any way, this hermitage 
			is an Accomplished one for gods, for sages, and for Supreme Divinities, 
			in taking a foothold to eliminate the evil on earth.

Shlok 19: "That great resplendent Vishnu then adopting a semblance of a dwarf 
			emerged from Aditi, and that dwarfish ascetic boy approached Emperor 
			Bali, the son of Virochana." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-29-19]

Shlok 20- 21: "That dwarf ascetic boy Vaamana begged and received a space that can 
			be covered in three strides, but strode all the three worlds in those 
			three steps for the purpose of saving worlds, as he is interested in 
			the welfare of all the worlds. Vishnu gave the earth back to Indra restraining 
			Emperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great resplendent Vishnu made 
			the three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. [1-29-20, 
			21]

[Commentary] The myth is that Vaamna, the dwarfish ascetic boy, approaches Emperor 
			Bali and begs of him for a space enough to place his three dwarfish 
			foot-steps. While all around that ritual hall of Bali laugh at this 
			boy's request, Bali comes to know who this dwarfish boy is. Though known 
			to be Vishnu in this incarnation, without deviating from his vow of 
			according charities in 'as is where is condition', Bali accords that 
			much space to the boy. Then Vaamna places one dwarfish foot on this 
			globe and the entire globe is covered with it. Vaamna then asks Bali 
			where to put the second foot. Bali shows heavenward, which heavenly 
			worlds are conquered by Bali and are under his control at that time. 
			Vaamana places his second dwarfish foot on all the heavenly worlds covering 
			all of them. Then again, Vaamana asks Bali as to where the third foot-space 
			is. Bali shows his head to place the third foot. Vaamana places his foot 
			on this third foot-space, i.e., on Bali's head and starts to trample 
			him to paataala-loka, nether worlds. At the time of donating 
			the charity, while Bali is pouring water oblation into the hands of 
			Vaamana, Sage Shukraachaarya, the demon's high priest, knowing this dwarf 
			boy to be Vishnu, enters the nozzle of the water pot so that the donation 
			water may not fall into the hands of the boy, thus to fail the donation. 
			Knowing that the sage is in the nozzle of the water-pot, Vaamana pierces 
			the nozzle with a straw of darbha, sacred grass-blade, thus piercing 
			one eye of Sage Shukraachaarya. From then on, this sage has become one-eyed 
			sage, symbolically meaning that he eyes on one side only, namely on 
			the side of demon's welfare. Vaamana places his third step on the head 
			of Emperor Bali and subjugates him to netherworlds, freeing the other 
			worlds from his rule. However, Vishnu blesses Bali to be deathless, 
			though subdued into netherworlds, and to become Indra in the coming 
			manvantara-s, eras. Then on Vishnu is eulogised as Trivikrama, tri- 
			vi-krama three, verily, paced - surpassing, one who surpasses all 
			the three worlds in three strides.

Shlok 22: "This hermitage which at one time is presided by Vishnu, is an eradicator 
			of stress, either the stress and strain caused by the evil on earth, 
			or the stress of going through the cycle of birth and death, thus this 
			hermitage is an accorded of salvation, and I am also beneficed with 
			this hermitage owing to my devotion to Vaamana. [1-29-22]

Shlok 23: "Demons causing obstacles, oh, tigerly man Rama, will be arriving at 
			that hermitage and there alone those demons with evil pursuit are to 
			be eliminated. [1-29-23]

Shlok 24: "Rama, we now go to the unexcelled hermitage of Accomplishment, oh, 
			dear one, as to how this hermitage belongs to me, this also belongs 
			to you." Thus Vishvamitra said to Rama. [1-29-24]

[Commentary] This hermitage is my benefice now for I am practising my asceticism 
			here, but originally this belongs to you because you have practised 
			your asceticism here in this hermitage as Vishnu, even earlier to your 
			Vaamana incarnation.' Rama Tilaka.

Shlok 25: So saying that great sage Vishvamitra is highly gladdened to lead Rama 
			together with Lakshmana to the hermitage, and on his entering the hermitage 
			with those two, that sage shone forth like moon with a two starred constellation 
			called Punarvasu, the fifth or seventh lunar mansion, after dispersal 
			of mist. [1-29-25]

Shlok 26: On seeing the arrival of Vishvamitra all of the resident sages of Accomplished 
			Hermitage have quickly approached him with hustle and bustle adoring 
			him. [1-29-26]

Shlok 27: Those sages reverenced Vishvamitra according to their deservedness, 
			likewise they have offered hospitality to both of the princes, Rama 
			and Lakshmana. [1-29-27]

Shlok 28: Those two princes from Raghu's dynasty and the enemy-subjugators, namely 
			Rama and Lakshmana, briefly took rest and adjoining palms they spoke 
			to the sagely tiger Vishvamitra. [1-29-28]

Shlok 29: "Oh, the eminent sage, today itself you may undertake the ritual of 
			solemnity that is undertaken prior to the main ritual, be safe, and 
			let this Hermitage of Accomplishment become an accomplished one in eradiating 
			vice true to its name, and let the word of yours given to my father 
			in fetching me to this place come true." So said Rama to Vishvamitra, 
			supported by Lakshmana. [1-29-29]

Shlok 30: When he is said so, that great radiant and supreme sage Vishvamitra, 
			thereupon scrupulously undertook the vow of ritual controlling his senses. 
			[1-29-30]

[Commentary] Vishvamitra controlling senses etc., is to say that he will cut off 
			from external world occupying himself with the ritual, without getting 
			anger and the like during the progression of this ritual, as explained 
			at 1-19-7 to King Dasharatha.

Shlok 31: Both the youngsters Rama and Lakshmana on spending that night vigilantly 
			got up with the sunrise. On finishing morning time bathing they meditated 
			upon the easterly aurora, and then on completing the supreme meditation 
			on Gayatri in its regularity, they addressed themselves to sage Vishvamitra, 
			who by now has enkindled ritual fire and sitting before the Altar of 
			Fire. [1-29-31, 32]

[Commentary] Rama and Lakshmana spent that night vigilantly but not in a clam and collected way.

SARGA 30
------------------------------

[Text] Rama and Lakshmana while safeguarding the ritual of Sage Vishvamitra for six days 
and nights, on the last night demons named Maareecha and Subaahu come to hinder 
the ritual. Rama acts deftly and hits out Maareecha to a long distance, but kills 
the other, namely Subaahu. Rama thus makes the ritual of sage Vishvamitra a success.

Shlok 1: The two enemy subjugators, Rama and Lakshmana, who are sensible of their conduct 
according to time and place, and who will be sensibly talking according to time 
and place, those princes then spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-30-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, god, we are interested to listen at which time those night-walkers come to 
disturb the ritual, and at which time we have to safeguard the ritual from them, 
that you tell us, let not that moment pass away." [1-30-2]

[Commentary] It appears from the word order as above, 'at which time those two demons are to 
be safeguarded by us?' But positioning the word samrakShNiiyau is a grammarian's 
headache. On this many kinds of declinations are said. Rama Tilaka attributes this
rakShNiiyau 'to be safeguarded' to ritual, and he says that 'from whom the 
ritual is to be safeguarded'

Shlok 3: All the sages available there are delighted with the princes of Kakutstha dynasty 
who are speaking thus and making haste for a combat with demons and they praised 
them. [1-30-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, Raghava-s, you have to safeguard this ritual for six nights and days from today, 
and this Sage Vishvamitra who is under the vow of ritual goes into muteness as required 
by the vow." Thus said the other sages near at ritual place. [1-30-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing that sentence of the other sages those two glorious princes have wakefully 
safeguarded that woodland of the ritual for six nights and days. [1-30-5]

Shlok 6: On alertly patrolling nearby the Altar of Fire those two enemy-destroyers who are 
the wielders of great bows and valiant ones have protected the best sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-30-6]

Shlok 7: While that period of six days is elapsing and when the sixth day has come, then 
Rama said to Saumitri, "you be prepared and be on alert." [1-30-7]

Shlok 8: While Rama is saying thus himself quickening to combat then the fire in the Altar 
of Fire flared up suddenly and highly, brightening the chief officiator of the ritual, 
namely Vishvamitra, and other priests around it. [1-30-8]

[Commentary] The compound prajajwaala, with many stresses for the flare is given 
here to import that the ritual is achieving its climax and it will be fructified 
thereby. The demons enter just at this juncture to spoil the ritual.

Shlok 9: The Altar of Fire around which sacred grass, drink-vessels, oblation spoons, firewood-sticks, 
and heaps of flowers are kept, and around which Vishvamitra and the conductors of 
ritual are sitting, that altar flared high. [1-30-9]

[Commentary] The darbha is kusha grass used specifically in rituals even today.
chamasa is a wooden vessels used for consuming soma juice. srukk 
is an arm-length wooden spoon with a palm size receptacle at one end used to pour 
clarified butter and other liquids into Altar of Fire to the chanting of hymns.
samidha-s comprises items of wood pieces or sticks, mainly from sandalwood 
trees and a variety of other items that are offered into fire.

Shlok 10: While the Vedic ritual is proceeding well towards its conclusion according to hymnal 
rendering and rules of conducting the ritual, a strident and frightening blare is 
generated in the sky. [1-30-10]

Shlok 11: As to how massive clouds appear in torrential cloudburst, likewise two demons appeared 
enshrouding the sky, and performing wizardry they are about to swoop down towards 
the Altar of Fire. [1-30-11]

Shlok 12: Maareecha and Subaahu are the monstrous demons that have come along with their followers 
and they have started to pour down spates of blood. [1-30-12]

Shlok 13: On noticing the Altar of Fire swamped with streams of blood, then Rama swiftly ran 
towards that direction and saw the demons in the sky. [1-30-13]

Shlok 14: Perceiving that the two demons are about to swoop down on Altar of Fire in haste, 
that lotus-eyed Rama however gave a quick checking look at Lakshmana saying this 
sentence. [1-30-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: "Lakshmana, I am reluctant to eliminate this kind of these ill-behaved and raw flesh 
eating demons, but no doubt, they will be puffed out with Manava missile like a 
gust puffing thick clouds, you may see." Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [1-30-15, 
16a]

Shlok 16b- 17: Saying so that agile Rama fitted the very benign and highly radiant arrow Maanava 
on his bow, and taking aim with it at Maareecha that highly furious Raghava darted 
it on the chest of Maareecha. [1-30-16b, 17]

Shlok 18: Cleanly hit with that great missile Maanava, demon Maareecha is pitched for a hundred 
yojana lengths in full, and flung down into an ocean rocking with tidewaters. [1-30-18]

Shlok 19: On seeing him highly whirling, rendered insensate and thrown out when rammed away 
with the strength of that Cold arrow Rama said this to Lakshmana. [1-30-19]

Shlok 20: "Lakshmana, see the Cold arrow belonging to Maanava missile expounded by Manu which 
is taking him away on baffling, but without taking away his life. [1-30-20]

[Commentary] Rama is reluctant to eliminate demon Maareecha at this juncture because the same 
demon discourages Ravana in confronting Rama, but becomes a golden deer at the behest 
of Ravana, at the time of Ravana's abducting Seetha. So, Rama shows forbearance 
at Maareecha till such time.

Shlok 21: "But I wish to kill these demons for they are ruthless, iniquitous, flagitious, 
ritual-hinderers and blood-drinkers." So said Rama to Lakshmana. [1-30-21]

Shlok 22: Thus saying to Lakshmana, as though to show his swift dexterity Rama, the descendent 
of Raghu dynasty, took up a very powerful missile called Aagneya astra, Fire-missile, 
and darted it on the chest of Subaahu, by which that demon Subaahu is struck and 
fell flat on ground. [1-30-22]

Shlok 23: In order to bring felicity to the sages that great glorious and supremely generous 
Raghava took up the missile of Air-god and hit down the remaining demons. [1-30-23]

Shlok 24: When Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, has eliminated all of the demons that 
are the hinderers of Vedic rituals, the sages available there in that hermitage 
idealised him as Indra was idealised once, when he became victories on demons. [1-30-24]

Shlok 25: On the completion of ritual beholding the precincts that are devoid of calamities 
the great sage Vishvamitra said this to Rama. [1-30-25]

Shlok 26: "My purpose in conducting the ritual is fully realised, oh, dextrous Rama, and you 
too, as a highly illustrious prince, have actualised the word of honour of your 
mentor, where one mentor is your father King Dasharatha and the other is myself, and 
likewise oh, valiant Rama the glory of this Accomplished hermitage is also actualised..." 
thus when Vishvamitra is applauding Rama, they have come close to vesper-time for 
vespertine prayers on Sandhya, the goddess of gloaming. [1-30-26]



SARGA 31
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishwamitra travels to Mithila kingdom to attend a ritual of King Janaka and 
also to see the auspicious bow of Shiva that is being worshipped in the palace of 
Janaka from ages. The other sages suggest to Rama, that he too may go over there 
along with them to see that marvellous bow. They all proceed from Siddha Ashram 
towards River SoNa, a tributary of Ganga, and camp on its bank for a night.

Shlok 1: Rejoicing for achieving the result of their journey with Vishvamitra, the brave 
Rama and Lakshmana then resided in that hermitage for that night, gladdening in 
their heart of hearts. [1-31-1]

Shlok 2: When that night turned into a new day, performing their morning chores both of the 
brother jointly approached Sage Vishvamitra, who is along with other sages by then. 
[1-31-2]

Shlok 3: And those gentle-speakers on reverencing that eminent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance 
is akin to the ritual-fire, they two spoke this highly courteous sentence to him. 
[1-31-3]

Shlok 4: "Oh, tigerly-sage, here are your attendants sir, available in your attendance, what 
order is to be carried out further, oh, eminent saint, that you may order us. [1-31-4]

Shlok 5: When they have said that way all those great sages spoke to Rama, keeping Vishvamitra 
at the helm of affairs. [1-31-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh, best one among men, a highly righteous Vedic ritual belonging to King Janaka 
of Mithila is going to take place, and we the sages are going over there. [1-31-6]

Shlok 7: "Oh, tigerly-man Rama, if you can come along with us, it will be expedient for you 
to see a monumental gem of bow there. [1-31-7]

[Commentary] The sages are not insisting on Rama to come along, but advising him to have a glimpse 
of that marvellous bow of Shiva, which none can lift to string, so far. The topic 
of Seetha is also not brought out by them, either, because it is in the know of 
Vishvamitra alone, and not known to these sages. Kings and princes have their own 
protocol of proper invitation. Here a third party is inviting Rama to some other 
king's ritual, which Rama may reject for being a prince. But it is suggestive to 
say the maxim an aahuuto adhvaryam gacChet 'even uninvited can attend a 
Vedic-ritual...' Thus the sages are tempting, rather than inviting Rama to come 
to Mithila in the name of a divine bow, seeing which any valiant prince would easily 
get excited to string.

Shlok 8: "Oh, best one among men, in early times indeed gods gave that awesome bow which 
has an unimaginable power and which is superbly incandescent in wars to an erstwhile 
king of Mithila in a congregation of a Vedic-ritual. [1-31-8]

[Commentary] This is the bow of Shiva with which He destroyed the ritual of Daksha. Then gods 
pleased Shiva and obtained this bow from Him. Then gods gave it to Devaraata, an 
earlier king of Mithila as a boon of Vedic-ritual.

Shlok 19: "Gods cannot capably lift it to string; gandharva-s, no; asura-s, no; demons, no; 
and for human beings, not in any way. [1-31-9]

Shlok 10: "Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great 
mighty princes are rendered incapable to string its bowstring. [1-31-10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, tigerly-man Rama, there in Mithila you can see that particular bow of the great-souled 
king of Mithila and his highly admirable Vedic ritual too, if you come with us. 
[1-31-11]

Shlok 12: "Once Devaraata, the grandparent of the present king Janaka of Mithila, conducted 
a Vedic-ritual and he indeed prayed only for this supreme bow with a best grip-handle 
as the fruit of that ritual from all of the gods and oh, tigerly man Rama, he got 
the same from them. [1-31-12]

[Commentary] For this kuurma puraaNa, padma puraNna puts it as: 
priitaH ca bhagavaan iisaH trisuulii niila lohitaH | pradadau satru naasaartham 
janakaaya adbhutam dhanuH || kuurma puraaNa | | caapam shambhoH dayaat dattam - 
padma puraaNa 'Satisfying with the ritual of Devaraata of Janaka, the Trident 
holder and holder of venom in throat, namely god Shiva, gave the marvellous bow 
to eliminate enemies.'

Shlok 13: "That bow has got a regular worship and especially during the periods of
dhanur utsava-s, festivals of bows-and- arrows. Hence 
it is kept in the palace of King of Mithila, and oh, Raghava it is worshipped with 
a variety of sandalwood pastes, scents of aloe substance, and with incenses." [1-31-13]

Shlok 14: Saying so that best saint Vishvamitra started to travel on along with the assemblages 
of sages, and even along with Rama and Lakshmana, whose tacit consent to follow 
the sage is obtained by now, and on bidding farewell to the deities of woodlands 
of that Accomplished Hermitage, where his ritual is accomplished with the help of 
Rama and Lakshmana. [1-31-14]

Shlok 15: "Adieu, georgic deities, everything bodes well to you all, on accomplishment of 
the ritual I have undertaken here, I wish to go from this Accomplished Hermitage 
towards the ranges of Himalayan Mountains that are on the northern bank of River 
Ganga." [1-31-15]

Shlok 16: Thus saying farewell to woodland-deities that descendent of Kaushika, namely Vishvamitra, 
the saint whose wealth is his ascesis started to journey on aiming to reach the 
northern side of River Ganga. [1-31-16]

Shlok 17: While that best saint set forth, the team of his close followers who are the advocators 
of Vedic canons have moved behind him, approximately with a hundred carts loaded 
with their ritual paraphernalia. [1-31-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: Even the residents of that Hermitage of Accomplishment, namely animals and birds, 
closely followed that great-souled Vishvamitra, whose wealth is his ascesis, in 
herds and flocks. But that sage Vishvamitra made those flocks of birds and the herds 
of animals to return to their places, as they have shown enough courtesy. [1-31-18, 
19a]

[Commentary] This following of animals and birds is to suggest that while any guest proceeding 
from their place, it is the courtesy of the residents of that place or house, to 
see him off for a distance, unlike 'showing a person the door.' Here Vishvamitra 
is the guest at these woodlands.

Shlok 19b- 20a: Those assemblages of sages on going far on their path made a camp on the bank of 
River Sona when the sun is dangling towards west. [1-31-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: When the sun went into dusk those sages with illimitable resplendence took their 
bath and on kindling the consumer of kindled oblations they completed their evening 
fire ritual, and then squatted before sage Vishvamitra. [1-31-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: And even Rama along with Lakshmana on worshipping those sages squatted before that 
intellectual Vishvamitra. [1-31-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: With growing inquisitiveness that resplendent Rama has asked the tigerly sage Vishvamitra 
whose wealth is his ascesis. [1-31-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "Oh, godly sage, this place is glistening with well-developed woodlands, really 
what is this place? You be blest! It will be apt of you tell about it, in essence." 
Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra.[1-31-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b: Sage Vishvamitra whose vows are unselfish and whose ascesis is exalted is motivated 
with the words of Rama and staying amidst the sages he started to tell all about 
that place. [1-31-24b, c]



SARGA 32
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra starts to narrate Kusha's legend. Vishvamitra is the 
			offspring of Kusha's dynasty. Brahma gives boon to Kusha to beget four 
			sons and one among them is Kushanaabha. Kushanabha begets a hundred daughters 
			of excellent beauty. When Vayu, Air-god cherishes them all, those girls 
			refuse him, as they prefer an arranged marriage by their father. Then 
			Air-god in his indignation disfigures them all.

Shlok 1: "Once there was a highly righteous kingly sage who is the brainchild 
			of Brahma, whose ascesis is of higher order, who has never flouted the 
			rules of rituals or his vows, and who revered the knowers of virtue 
			by name Kusha." Thus Sage Vishvamitra commenced narration. [1-32-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: "That great-souled Kusha begot four selfsame and mighty sons, namely 
			Kushamba, Kushanaabha, Adhuurtarajasa also called as Asuurtarajasa,  
			and Vasu through the princess of Vidarbha, which princess is of noble 
			birth and an eligible wife of Kusha. [1-32-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4: "With an aspiration that his sons shall uphold the principles of Kshatriya-s, 
			Kusha spoke to them who are brilliant, highly enthusiastic, virtue abiding, 
			and the advocators of truth saying, 'establish your rulership, sons, 
			and achieve righteousness abundantly.' [1-32-3b, 4]

Shlok 5: "On hearing the words of Kusha those four sons that are the formidable 
			ones in the world and the best men among people initiated to build four 
			cities. [1-32-5]

Shlok 6: "Great-resplendent Kushamba built the city named Kaushambii for his 
			part, and for his part the virtue-souled Kushanaabha built a city named 
			Mahodaya. [1-32-6]

Shlok 7: "Oh, Rama, noble-minded Adhuurtarajasa built a city named Dharmaaranya, 
			and king Vasu built a city in the name of Girivraja. [1-32-7]

[Commentary] It is believed that the city Kaushambii is the present day Kannauj and 
			Girivraja the present day Rajgir.

Shlok 8: "This land on which we are presently staying is known as the land of 
			virtue-souled Vasu, all around which these five best mountains are standing 
			high. [1-32-8]

Shlok 9: "This charming river that enters and exits Magadha province is well 
			known as the worthy River Maagadhi, and flowing amid the five of these 
			elevated mountains it shines forth like a garland enwreathing them. 
			[1-32-9]

[Commentary] This river is said to be the present day River Son



"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great mighty princes
							 are rendered incapable to string its bowstring.

Shlok 11: "This Maagadhi is that river which pertains to the developmental works 
			of the great-souled king Vasu and oh, Rama, flowing towards east to 
			its confluence in Ganga, this river garlands best farmlands and their 
			crops on its way. [1-32-10]

[Commentary] The confluence of this river with Ganga is said as the one now available 
			near at Patna, Bihar.

Shlok 11: "The virtue-souled kingly saint Kushanaabha gave birth to a hundred 
			daughters with unexcelled beauty through a celestial female called Ghritaachi. 
			[1-32-11]

[Commentary] Children begotten through celestial maidens are of superior nature for 
			further procreating a divine generation, like Shakuntala, who begot 
			Bharata, the earliest dynastic king.

Shlok 12: "Those girls when attained youthfulness they are lovely and on an occasion 
			they have gone to gardens and moved there about like one lightning with 
			a hundred streaks during rainy season, and while those girls that are 
			decorated with select ornaments are singing, dancing and playing musical 
			instruments, they got into a fantastic felicity. [1-32-12, 13]

Shlok 14: "On their coming to parklands those girls whose all limbs are pretty 
			and whose looks are unparalleled on earth, they looked like stars amid 
			clouds within the cloudy thickets of garden bushes. [1-32-14]

Shlok 15: "On seeing them who are flourishing with all their aspects together 
			with comeliness and ripeness, the all pervading Air-god, Vayu, spoke 
			this word to them. [1-32-15]

Shlok 16: " 'I have a desire for you all, hence leaving off the notions pertaining 
			to human beings you all become my wives, thereby you too will acquire 
			longevity like divinities. [1-32-16]

Shlok 17: " 'Teenage is always transitory, expressly in humans, but on marrying 
			me you will achieve undiminished youthfulness and forever you can be 
			youthful like immortal females.' Thus Air-god said to those girls. [1-32-17]

Shlok 18: "On hearing that proposal of Vayu, the Air-god whose strives are unimpeded, 
			then those hundred girls spoke this sentence laughing off his proposal. 
			[1-32-18]

Shlok 19: " 'we are aware that you inspirit all the living beings from inside, 
			oh, the ablest divinity, we are also aware of your uniqueness. But, 
			what for you are dishonouring all of us. [1-32-19]

Shlok 20: " 'We are the daughters of Kushanaabha, oh, best divinity, and we are 
			all capable of displacing you from your realm, but oh, god, we are restraining 
			ourselves in doing so only to conserve our ascetic values. [1-32-20]

Shlok 21: " 'That time shall never come, oh, god with sordid thinking, when we, 
			at our liberty, may look up for our grooms overlooking our veracious 
			father.' [1-32-21]

Shlok 22: " 'Our father is indeed our lord and for us he is the ultimate god too. 
			To whomever we are offered by our father in marriage he alone becomes 
			our husband.' So said hundred girls to Air-god. [1-32-22]

Shlok 23: On hearing their sentence of rejection, Vayu, the Air-god whose impact 
			is powerful, very angrily entered into all of the limbs of those girls 
			only to disfigure them. [1-32-23]

Shlok 24: "Those girls whom Air-god disfigured in that way have entered palace-chambers 
			of the king, but they have entered diffidently, embarrassedly, and tearfully. 
			[1-32-24]

Shlok 25: "That king on seeing his dear and attractive daughters as disfigured 
			and despondent girls he is highly perturbed and said this. [1-32-25]

Shlok 26: " 'Oh, daughters, what all is this? Who disregarded probity? Who disfigured 
			you all? Let it be said! Why you gesticulate saying nothing.' asking 
			thus that king sighed and quietened down waiting for a reply." Thus 
			Sage Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-32-26]



SARGA 33
------------------------------

[Text] Daughters of Kushanaabha report about the Air-god's mischief. Pleased 
			at their behaviour Kushanaabha thinks and arranges for their marriage 
			with Brahmadatta, a saintly king. After the marriage, by the touch of 
			hand of Brahmadatta the girls are rid of their misshapen bodies and 
			they again become great beauties.

Shlok 1: On hearing that sentence of scholarly Kushanaabha those hundred 
			girls touched his feet with their foreheads and spoke to him. [1-33-1]

Shlok 2: " 'The all-pervasive Air-god desired to dishonour us, oh, king, resorting 
			to improper approach and overlooking virtuous conduct. [1-33-2]

Shlok 3: " 'Our father is there and we are not independent, you be safe, hence 
			oh, Air-god, you may request our father to know whether he gives us 
			to you or not.' Thus we have told the Air-god, but... [1-33-3]

Shlok 4: " 'Though we all have spoken to him thus, that Air-god who is bound 
			by venality refused to take notice of our words and he has harmed us 
			a lot.' Thus those girls informed their father. [1-33-4]

[Commentary] Since then, because the Wind-God bent / The damsels' forms for punishment, 
			/ That royal town is known to fame / By Kanyakubja's borrowed name. 
			That is, the City of the Bent Virgins, the modern Kanauj or Canouge 
			- Griffith.

Shlok 5: On listening their words that highly virtuous and highly resplendent 
			king spoke to the hundred girls with unsurpassed virtue. [1-33-5]

Shlok 6: " 'Forgiving is the duty of imperturbable and you have done it. Excellent. 
			Oh, daughters, coursing through your unity my family's prestige is also 
			kept up. [1-33-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: " 'Forgiveness is an adornment to women, as a matter of fact, even for 
			men, and this matter called 'forgiving' that which is there, it is an 
			impracticable affair. That too, in respect of divinities. And the kind 
			of forgiveness you all possess uniformly, that is further laudable. 
			[1-33-7, 8a]

[Commentary] This also means: 'though you possess excellent aspects and persona alike 
			celestials, viz., apsara-s, for you are the children of celestial / 
			apsara Ghritachi... you have forgiven Air-god, without submitting yourselves 
			to bodily pleasures of humans.'

Shlok 8b- 9a: " 'Grace is altruism, grace is ritualism, oh, my daughters, grace is 
			glory, grace is virtue, and this universe is verily abiding in graciousness 
			alone for grace itself is the truth, isn't it!' Thus king Kushanaabha 
			said to his daughters and sent them away. [1-33-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: "On leaving those girls, oh, Rama, that king whose valour matches that 
			of gods and who is an expert in thinking strategies started to think 
			with his ministers on the topics like, as to how his daughters are to 
			be espoused to, to which country they are to be sent, at which time 
			marriage shall happen, and to which matching bridegroom the marriage 
			is to be proposed, and so on." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. 
			[1-33-9b, 10]

Shlok 11: During that time a great-resplendent sage named Cuulii is there, who 
			is propitious in his demeanour and who holds his semen upward, and who 
			has achieved high ascetic practise strictly according to Vedic canons. 
			[1-33-11]

[Commentary] The uurdhvaretas is that the yogi-s of a very high practice 
			of pure yoga called haThayoga, will hold their semen un-ejaculated 
			by use or misuse, and they make it course towards their heads through 
			the six-plexuses of human body. This type of practice is to enrich their 
			mental and physical glow and they will have a divine aura around them.

Shlok 12: "While that sage is in the practise of asceticism a celestial female served 
him at the place of his ascesis, safety be with you oh, Rama, she is Somada by her 
name, the daughter of Urmila. [1-33-12]

Shlok 13: "Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering 
			to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Cuulii 
			has become satisfied with her service. [1-33-13]

Shlok 14: "When her service is fructified, oh, Rama, that sage benevolently spoke 
			to her saying, 'I am perfectly pleased with your service, let good betide 
			you, what cherish of yours I have to fulfil.' [1-33-14]

Shlok 15: "Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada 
			who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke 
			with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. [1-33-15]

Shlok 16: " 'Vedic splendour is flourishing in you when you have become one with 
			Brahma, oh, supreme ascetic, I may please be endowed with a righteous 
			son whose ascetic spirituality may embody the spirituality enunciated 
			in Veda-s. [1-33-16]

Shlok 17: " 'I am unmarried and nobody's wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter 
			under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your 
			faculty of asceticism.' So said Somada to sage Cuulii. [1-33-17]

Shlok 18: "That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and 
			Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild. 
			[1-33-18]

[Commentary] The word 'cuuli' also read as Cuulina, another name for this sage 
			Cuuli.

Shlok 19: "King Brahmadatta endued with superb grandeur ruled from a city called 
			Kaampilya as with Indra ruling the heaven. [1-33-19]

Shlok 20: "The most righteous king Kushanaabha then made up his mind, oh, Rama 
			of Kakutstha, to espouse his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta. [1-33-20]

Shlok 21: "Inviting Brahmadatta that great-resplendent lord of the land, namely 
			the king Kushanaabha, married his hundred daughters to him, pleasing 
			highly in his heart of hearts. [1-33-21]

Shlok 22: "As with the tradition of marriage king Brahmadatta who vies with lord 
			of gods, namely Indra, in succession took the palm of each of the hundred 
			girls into his palm. [1-33-22]

Shlok 23: "By mere touch of hand of Brahmadatta alone, their misshape and desperation 
			are evanished, and all of those hundred maidens beamed bright as they 
			are retouched with utmost elegance. [1-33-23]

Shlok 23: "On seeing his daughters getting release from the effect of Air-god 
			Kushanaabha became highly joyful, and he took great delight time and 
			again as and when he looked at them. [1-33-24]

Shlok 25: "Later when the marriage is complete king Kushanaabha bade farewell 
			to king Brahmadatta along with his wives, his own hundred daughters, 
			and along with the groups of religious teachers. [1-33-25]

Shlok 26: "Somada, the celestial female and the mother of Brahmadatta, is gladdened 
			to see her son Brahmadatta, for the worthwhile deed done by him in removing 
			the blemish caused by the Air-god to the girls, or in bringing those 
			worthwhile girls as her daughter-in-laws. She is further gladdened while 
			her feet are traditionally and repeatedly touched by a hundred daughter-in-laws 
			in succession, coupled with her own raising of each of the daughter-in-law 
			to embrace for a hundred times. Thus Somada has gone on caressing each 
			of her hundred daughter-in-laws, and in doing so she is gladdened to 
			do so over and over again, she is gladdened. She thus praised Kushanaabha 
			for giving his gemlike daughters as her daughter-in-laws and blessed 
			the daughter-in-laws. [1-33-26]

[Text] Vishvamitra narrates about the birth of Gaadhi, his own father and the son of Kushanaabha. 
Incidentally he narrates about the emergence and prominence of River Kaushiki, who 
is Vishwamitra's elder sister turned out as a sacred River.

Shlok 1: When Brahmadatta has married and left, oh, Raghava, king Kushanaabha he embarked 
on Vedic-ritual called putrakaameSThi in order to 
beget a son because is sonless. [1-34-1]

Shlok 2: During the performance of the ritual, supremely generous Kusha, the brainchild of 
Brahma and the father of Kushanaabha, spoke to the king Kushanaabha. [1-34-2]

Shlok 3: " 'Oh, son, there will be a highly virtuous and selfsame son of yours, known as 
Gaadhi, and through him you also will get everlasting renown in the world.' " Thus 
Kusha said to Kushanaabha. [1-34-3]

Shlok 4: "Saying so, oh, Rama, Kushanaabha's father Kusha entered the sky and journeyed to 
the time-honoured abode of Brahma. [1-34-4]

Shlok 5: "Then after some time that highly intellectual Kushanaabha begot a supremely righteous 
son known by the name Gaadhi. [1-34-5]

Shlok 6: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, that eminently righteous Gaadhi is my father, and 
since I am born in Kusha dynasty, oh, Raghu's legatee, I got the name Kaushika." 
Sage Vishvamitra thus narrating to Rama. [1-34-6]

Shlok 7: "Even my elder sister who undertook benevolent vows and who is renowned by her name 
Satyavathi is there, oh, Raghava, and she is given in marriage to sage Ruchika. 
[1-34-7]

Shlok 8: "She journeyed to heaven with her body while she followed her departed husband and 
being a very generous lady she coursed as a great river renowned as River Kaushiki. 
[1-34-8]

[Commentary] Now called Kos'i (Cosy) corrupted from Kaus'ika, daughter of Kusha. 'This is one 
of those personifications of rivers so frequent in the Grecian mythology, but in 
the similar myths is seen the impress of the genius of each people, austere and 
profoundly religious in India, graceful and devoted to the worship of external beauty 
in Greece.' Gorresio.

Shlok 9: "Desiring to yield benefit for the welfare of world, my sister has emerged with 
her divinely pious and delightful waters, taking recourse to Himalayan Mountains. 
[1-34-9]

[Commentary] If the first compound is lokasya hitakaamaartham then 'to accord both 
mortal and immortal happiness; paaralaukika, aihikasaukhyam . My sister's 
holy waves are hurled / To purify and glad the world. - Griffith.

Shlok 10: "Thereby, oh, Rama, I am delightfully and abidingly residing on the mountainsides 
of Himalayas, in adjacency of my sister Kausiki in all my affection for her. [1-34-10]

Shlok 11: "She that Satyavathi for her part is a pious one, steadfast in truthfulness and 
righteousness, a husband devote, and such a highly fortunate one has emerged as 
a best river among rivers, namely River Kaushiki. [1-34-11]

Shlok 12: "Owing to my vow, oh, Rama, I left her for a while and came to the Accomplished 
Hermitage and owing to your magnificence I have become accomplished in that vow 
of mine. [1-34-12]

Shlok 13: "Oh, dextrous Rama, this is all about my dynasty, my province on which we are presently 
camping namely the riverbanks of Sona, and about my birth, and thus everything is 
narrated as you have asked me. [1-34-13]

Shlok 14: "By telling these legends it is past midnight, oh, Kakutstha, you get some sleep. 
Safe you be! Let no hindrance occur for us halfway on our pathway. [1-34-14]

Shlok 15: "Oh, Raghu's delight, trees are standstill... animals and birds have slouched... 
nightly sombre has pervaded all the confines. [1-34-15]

Shlok 16: "Eventide lapsed slowly and the vault of heaven filled with stars and starlets is 
splendorous as though orbs of heaven are overspread on its vault. [1-34-16]

Shlok 17: "Also, dissipating the darkness of the world with his brilliance, the moon with 
coolant moonbeams is rising up, gladdening the hearts of worldly beings. [1-34-17]

Shlok 18: "Now, the bands of yaksha-s, demons, even the ferocious ogres that feed on raw flesh, 
why them, all the beings that take pleasure in nights are astir, far and wide." 
So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-34-18]

Shlok 19: Saying so that greatly resplendent and eminent saint Vishvamitra paused, and then 
all the other sages have revered him saying, "well-said, well-said." [1-34-19]

Shlok 20: "Sublime is this lineage of Kusha dynasty which always dedicated itself to righteousness, 
and the dynasty of Kusha are the best ones among mankind, and they symbolise with 
god Brahma himself, thus they are highly reverential." Thus the other sages have 
applauded Vishvamitra and his dynasty. [1-34-20]

Shlok 21: "You alone are exemplarily selfsame to Brahma, oh, Vishvamitra of great-renown, 
and among rivers that prominent River Kaushiki is your sister, thus she is glorifying 
your ancestry." Thus the sages lauded Vishvamitra. [1-34-21]

Shlok 22: Sage Vishvamitra is pleased when those tigerly sages have laude him, and then that 
magnificent sage Vishvamitra lapsed into the lap of sleep, as the sun lapses into 
lap of dusk for that day. [1-34-22]

Shlok 23: Even Rama with a little astonishment coming upon him, applauding that tigerly-sage, 
and glided into the lap of sleep along with Soumitri. [1-34-23]

------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra along with others reach the banks of River Ganga and 
			they make their sojourn on that riverbank. There when Rama inquisitively 
			enquires about River Ganga Vishvamitra narrates the legend of Ganga, 
			as to how she is taken to heavens by gods from her father Himalayas.

Shlok 1: On sojourning the remaining night on the bank of river Sona along with 
			great-sages, Viswamitra spoke when that night is elapsing into a sunny 
			daybreak. [1-35-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, Rama, night fared into a sunny morning, eastern day-spring is set 
			in, hence awake and arise, you be safe, ready yourself for further travel." 
			[1-35-2]

Shlok 3: On hearing the words of Sage Vishvamitra, Rama woke up and on completion 
			of morning time religious activities he readied himself for further 
			journey and indeed spoke this sentence to the sage. [1-35-3]

Shlok 4: "This River Sona is with auspicious waters and even adorned with dunes, 
			where it is so deep. Oh, Brahman, in which of the two ways, namely 
			by fordless waters or by fordable water with dunes, we have to cross 
			this river?" [1-35-4]

Shlok 5: When Rama spoke to him thus sage Vishvamitra replied, "I propose the 
			same route by which these great sages are going. [1-35-5]

Shlok 6: Thus spoken by that astute Sage Vishvamitra, the other great sages travelled 
			on, indeed beholding diverse forests and their environs. [1-35-6]

Shlok 7: On going a distance on their way, and after a lapse of half a day, then 
			they perceived the prominent one among rivers and the one adored by 
			sages, namely River Ganga. [1-35-7]

Shlok 8: On seeing River Ganga with her pious waters and adored by swans and 
			saarasa waterfowls, all the sages felt delighted together with both 
			of the Raghava-s, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [1-35-8]

Shlok 9- 10- 11a: Then they sojourned on the riverbank of Ganga, and next on taking bath 
			in Ganga they have customarily offered that river's water as oblations 
			to their manes. After that, on enkindling the ritual-fire they have 
			also offered fire-oblations into it for gods. Later, dining on their 
			part of those ambrosian oblations with which they have oblated the fire, 
			those sages perched on the propitious banks of Ganga, surrounding the 
			great-souled Vishvamitra from all sides, to the contentment of their 
			heart in having performed religious chores on the riverbank of Ganga. 
			[1-35-9, 10, 11a]

Shlok 11b: When sages are sitting at ease then even Rama and Lakshmana sat down 
			according to their admissibility and custom of sitting before their 
			teachers, and then Rama highly gladdened at heart has spoken to Vishvamitra. 
			[1-35-11]

Shlok 12: "Oh, godly sage, I wish to listen about Ganga, the river that has a 
			trinal course, and as to how she is reaching the husband of rivulets 
			and rivers, namely the ocean, on pervading all the three worlds." Thus 
			Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-35-12]

Shlok 13: Motivated by Rama's words the eminent-sage Vishvamitra commenced to 
			narrate about the emergence and that way even about the progression 
			of River Ganga. [1-35-13]

Shlok 14: "The lordly mountain Himavan who is the greatest treasure trove of minerals, 
			Rama, also treasures up a pair of daughters who by their comeliness 
			are unequalled on earth. [1-35-14]

Shlok 15: "The slender-waisted and fascinating daughter of Mt. Meru, oh, Rama, 
			renowned by her name Mena, is the dear wife of Himavan and the mother 
			of those two daughters, indeed. [1-35-15]

Shlok 16: "This Ganga has emerged as an elder daughter to Himavan through Mena, 
			oh, Raghava, and that way a girl renowned by the name Uma has become 
			a second daughter to him. [1-35-16]

Shlok 17: "Later, all of the divinities intending to fulfil a divine purpose have 
			sought the lordly mountain Himavan to spare Ganga, who is scheduled 
			to become a tri-way-cruising river. [1-35-17]

Shlok 18: "With a righteous thinking and hopeful of the welfare in triadic world, 
			Himavan then spared his daughter Ganga whose flow is at her own volition. 
			[1-35-18]

Shlok 19: "Those divinities who are the well-wishers of the well-being of tri-world 
			welcomed Ganga, who is incidentally intended for the purpose of the 
			tri-world, and they came back to heaven fetching Ganga with them, with 
			a heartfelt joy for their purpose is fulfilled. [1-35-19]

Shlok 20: "The other daughter of Himavanta, oh, Raghu's descendent, that unmarried 
			girl namely Uma, she performed a rigorous sacrament taking hold of a 
			supreme devoutness as her ascesis itself is her wealth. [1-35-20]

Shlok 21: "As for Uma who is unified with her rigorous sacrament and who is adored 
			by all the world, that best one among mountains Himavanta gave such 
			a daughter to the unique god Rudra. [1-35-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, Raghava, the prominent one among rivers namely Ganga and Uma Devi 
			as well, these are the two daughters of the king of mountains that are 
			highly revered by the world. [1-35-22]

Shlok 23: "Dear boy Rama with beautiful gait, as to how the triply coursing Ganga 
			has cruised to heaven in the first phase, I have related all about that 
			cruise to you. [1-35-23]

[Commentary] The three-way coursing of the river is firstly as Ganga in the lap of 
			Himalayas. Then when she cruised heavenward with divinities as Deva 
			Ganga, or Mandaakini or Sudiirghika, it is second. Later, when she came 
			to earth from heaven and gone into ocean and even to netherworlds as 
			Jahnavi, it is the third. There are variations for this. Some say that 
			the river's entry into sky is the first, by taking words gatimataam 
			vara, gati and deriving meaning as - which sky grants a path for 
			all moving things etc., and the next is her entry to heaven, and nextly 
			her coming to earth. And some say that gods have not left her in middle 
			of the sky to come to heaven at a later time, and hence her three courses 
			are as Ganga, Mandaakini, and Jahnavi.

Shlok 24: "As such, that marvellous and sinless daughter of the lordly mountain 
			Himavanta, ever-flowing in the form of water, ascended to the abode 
			of divinities and became devaganga , Divine 
			River. [1-35-24]



SARGA 36
------------------------------

[Text] Shiva on his marriage with Uma is in the conjugal bliss for a long period 
			due to his yogic powers. Fearing the result of that prolonged activity 
			all gods pray for the cessation of it because none in any world can 
			carry that offspring. Shiva accepting that request asks them where to 
			discharge the sperm that has already stirred up. Gods indicate the earth 
			as the taker. Shiva accordingly inundates the earth with his fluid. 
			Then the Fire-god is dispatched to consolidate that into a reed forest 
			called sharavaNa . Goddess Uma ireful at 
			the prevention of begetting a son, now curses gods and earth to be childless.

Shlok 1: When that sage Vishvamitra has finished narration of the legend of the 
			daughters of Himavanta, both the brave ones, namely Raghava and Lakshmana 
			in their turn have extolled that legend and spoke to that eminent-sage. 
			[1-36-1]

Shlok 2: "This admirable discourse given by you about Ganga is exhaustive in 
			righteousness, oh, Brahman, and it will be apt of you to tell emphatically 
			about the divine and earthly legend of the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			namely Ganga, for you are aware to expatiate upon it. [1-36-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: "By which reason that world purifier Ganga influxes into three paths? 
			Oh, virtue-knower, and connected with which deeds of merit this triple-courser 
			Ganga is renowned as the best one among all the rivers in three worlds?" 
			Thus Rama and Lakshmana have asked the sage Vishvamitra. [1-36-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: When Kakutstha-s have enquired that way, the ascetically-wealthy sage 
			Vishvamitra has narrated all the legend of Ganga in its entirety, staying 
			among the sages. [1-36-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: "On his getting married to Uma, oh, Rama, the sublime-ascetic and bluish 
			throated god Shiva, as his throat became blue when he consumed poison 
			during the churning of Milky Ocean, at one time with a predilection 
			towards her he has started lovemaking with her. [1-36-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b: "While that sublime, sagacious and blue-throated God Shiva is in lovemaking, 
			oh, enemy-scorcher Rama, a hundred divine years have elapsed, even then 
			he had no son in her, namely Goddess Uma. [1-36-6b, c, 7]

[Commentary] The hundred divine years are said to be 36,000 mortal years and this 
			goes with the calculation of yuga Indian 'era' calculation 
			where two thousand of four yuga-s, kR^ita, treta, dvaapara, kali 
			yuga-s are one brahmadina Brahma's day etc.

Shlok 7b- 8a: "All the gods headed by Brahma have then started to ponder, 'is there 
			anybody who can inevitably sustain that being which emerges from this 
			goddess Uma after this prolonged yogic act of copulation with Shiva?' 
			This being the worry of all gods they have prepared for action. [1-36-7b, 
			8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: "All of the gods on approaching and paying their deference to Shiva 
			spoke this to him, 'oh, God of Gods, oh, one who is interested in the 
			welfare of these worlds, oh, Great-God, considering the supplication 
			of all gods it will be apt of you to bestow grace.' [1-36-8b, 9]

[Commentary] This prolonged act of copulation is an act of yoga called mahaa- 
			maithuna. The Shaktaite Tantriks who practise panca-ma-kaara 
			: madya, maamsa, matsya, mudra, maithuna 'liquor' 'mutton' 'fish' 
			'postures' [loosely: callisthenics] and 'copulation' make use of these 
			things. In these practises, the yogis use mudra-s 'posture' 
			'callisthenics' at the time of copulation even, so that there will be 
			no ejaculation for a longer period. This is their 'Five-element theory...'

Shlok 10- 11: " 'Worlds cannot capably bear your offspring born out of your effulgence, 
			oh, Supreme-God, hence you may practice yogic asceticism along with 
			your consort Goddess Uma in unison with Vedic postulates of Yoga, rather 
			than progeniture, and desiring the welfare of the three worlds you may 
			please retain your refulgent seed within your own radiance, thus protect 
			this universe, since it will not be apt of you to render it devoid of 
			worlds with the efflux of the unmanageable potence of yours .' So said 
			gods to Shiva. [1-36-10, 11]

[Commentary] The word tejas also means semen, or offspring, besides resplendence
			tejaH paraakrame praaNe varcas arciShi retasi - ratnamaala 
			thus the prospective offspring through ejaculation is the problem here, 
			because Kumara, or, Skanda takes birth with all the irrepressible effulgence 
			of Shiva, plus his own.

Shlok 12: "On listening the words of gods that Rarefied-God of Universe, namely 
			Shiva said, 'so be it,' and further spoke this to all of the gods, indeed. 
			[1-36-12]

Shlok 13: " 'I wish to bear my sperm in my virility and Uma in hers, let the immortals 
			and mortals as well, derive a perfect bliss. [1-36-13]

Shlok 14: " 'But that part which has already stirred up from its place is irrestrainable, 
			as such, oh gods of eminence, you tell me who can contain that part 
			of the unexcelled potence.' So said Shiva to gods. [1-36-14]

Shlok 15: "Thus spoken by Shiva, then the gods in reply spoke to him whose banner 
			is Divine-Bull, namely Shiva, 'that part of the potence which has already 
			stirred up, the earth indeed endures that now. [1-3-15]

Shlok 16: "Thus said by the gods that Yogi of par excellence and the God of Gods, 
			Shiva, discharged his refulgent semen with which the earth together 
			with its mountains and forests is overspread. [1-36-16]

Shlok 17: "Thereby the gods in their turn said even to Fire-god, 'you enter the 
			great-potence of Rudra along with Wind-god, lest that potence may annihilate 
			the earth and earthlings, because you can consume anything that comes 
			in touch with you. [1-36-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: "And when Fire-god invaded that great-potence of Shiva it has emerged 
			as White-mountain, also thus it has become as a divine forest of reeds 
			equalling the Sun and Fire in its resplendence, wherefrom the highly 
			brilliant Kumara has emerged. [1-36-18, 19a]

[Commentary] Because Kumara, or Skanda took birth through Fire-god from the great-potence 
			of Shiva, he is called the one born out of fire. Because Krittika stars 
			have suckled him he is also called as Kaaritkeya. The birth and legend 
			of Kaartikeya is detailed in the next chapter relating to Ganga.

Shlok 19b- 20a: "Later on, the gods together with the assemblages of sages are well 
			pleased at heart as it has happened according to their prayer, thereby 
			they fulsomely adored Shiva and even Uma. [1-36-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "Oh, Rama, but the daughter of Himalayan Mountain, namely Uma, while 
			irefully saying this to the divinities she cursed them all with her 
			eyes reddened in anger. [1-36-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: " 'Wherefore, I who am desirous of a son had been prevented from the 
			intimacy with my husband, therefore you shall be infecund to beget progeny 
			through your own wives. [1-36-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22- 23a: " 'And from now onwards you wives shall remain infertile...' and on 
			saying this way to all of the gods she also gave a curse to the earth. 
			[1-36-22, 23a]

[Commentary] Thus the celestials do not directly breed. They take the agency of humans 
			or other mortals to bring forth their offspring as in the case of the 
			monkey race, and Menaka, and as in the case of Vishvamitra giving birth 
			to Shakuntala, who in her turn gave birth to Bharata, so on.

Shlok 23b- 24: " 'Oh, Earth, your appearance shall be bizarre and you will be a wife 
			to many. And oh, verily base-minded earth, rendered sully by my anger 
			you shall have no gratification caused by the children as you are bigoted 
			against my son. [1-36-23b, 24]

[Commentary] The sin of earth to bear the curse of Uma Devi is to accept the semen 
			of Shiva on her surface. The appearance of earth will not be in one 
			kind or quality for it has lands and oceans, deserts and forests, volcanoes 
			and mountains, ice and humidity, etc. Further, the earth is the official 
			wife to numerous kings. The earth is also cursed to not to have the 
			delight of her children. The earth has Naraka, the demon, and Seetha 
			as her children. But these two are not begotten through any seminal 
			contact by earth, and further, for earth it is as good as not having 
			these two as her children, for such is the plight of these two so-called 
			children of earth on earth. After many tumults in her life, even Seetha 
			asks her mother on earth, i.e., mother earth herself, to take her back 
			into her womb.

Shlok 25: "That God of Gods Shiva becoming ill at ease to look at all of the distressed 
			gods, equally feeling small to convince his consort Uma, he has started 
			to journey towards the western quarter which is ruled by Rain-god. [1-36-25]

Shlok 26: "On going to the northern side of Himalayan Mountains, that God of Gods, 
			Shiva settled down in ascesis along with his consort Uma on the peak 
			of a mountain emerged from Himalayas. [1-36-26]

[Commentary] Here some say the mountain on which Shiva settled for ascesis as 
			himavatprabhava giving it a full name, like Mt. Kailash or Kanchanjunga 
			etc. If any such mountain peak is named and available in mythologies 
			or in Himalayas, this needs a revision.

Shlok 27: "This is the legend of mountain's daughter, namely Goddess Uma vividly 
			narrated to you, oh, Rama, and now listen from me along with Lakshmana 
			about the emergence of Ganga. [1-36-27]



SARGA 37
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra continues his narration about the earthly course of Ganga, her 
			begetting Kaartikeya, Krittika-stars breast-feeding that boy, gods naming that 
			boy as Kaarthikeya, and that boy's anointment as the Chief of Celestial Armies.

Shlok 1: "While god Shiva is undertaking ascesis thus, then the gods desiring an Army Chief 
			for celestial forces have arrived in the audience of Forefather Brahma, along 
			with Indra and keeping Fire-god at their fore." Sage Vishvamitra continued his 
			narration to Rama. [1-37-1]

Shlok 2: "On approaching the Forefather Brahma, oh, Rama, all of the celestials headed 
			by Fire-god and along with Indra have venerated and then spoke this to him. [1-37-2]

Shlok 3: " 'Oh, god Brahma, he who has hypothetically given a Chief of Celestial Army in 
			the form of his potence that god Shiva is undertaking a supreme ascesis, indeed 
			along with Goddess Uma. [1-37-3]

[Commentary] The potence that is stirred from Shiva and given to earth as in last chapter has 
			not yet materialised as Kaarthikeya.

Shlok 4: " 'Looking forward for the welfare of the worlds, oh, knower of the procedures, 
			Brahma, you may order us clearly what is to be done next, as you alone are our 
			ultimate recourse. [1-37-4]

Shlok 5: "On listening the words of gods, Brahma, the Forefather of all the worlds, soothingly 
			spoke this to the celestials with sweet words. [1-37-5]

Shlok 6: " 'What the Daughter of Mountain, namely Goddess Uma, has said that 'you shall 
			have no posterity in your own wives' is true and it cannot be decried, and it 
			is unambiguous too. [1-37-6]

Shlok 7: " 'In whom the Fire-god can procreate an enemy-destroying Chief of Celestial Armies, 
			such an empyreal Ganga is there. [1-37-7]

Shlok 8: " 'The elder daughter King of Mountains, namely Ganga, will graciously welcome 
			the offspring from Fire-god, and that act of Ganga in welcoming the offspring 
			through Fire-god will also be pleasurable in many ways to the younger daughter 
			of King of Mountains, namely Uma, no doubt about it.' So said Brahma to all the 
			gods. [1-37-8]

Shlok 9: "On hearing those words of Brahma, oh, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, all 
			the gods have praisefully worshipped him, as their ends are achieved at the bidding 
			fair of Brahma. [1-37-9]

Shlok 10: "On going to that supreme Mt. Kailash, oh, Rama, which is heaped up with many 
			ores, all of those gods have assigned the Fire-god to father a son. [1-37-10]

Shlok 11: " 'Oh, Fire-god, you please coordinate the mission of gods, oh, great-resplendent 
			god of Fire, you may release the potence of Shiva, which you have contained so 
			far, in the daughter of King of Mountains, namely River Ganga.' Thus, all gods 
			have requested the Fire-god. [1-37-11]

Shlok 12: "On assuring the gods that he will do his best, the Fire-god approached Ganga 
			entreating, 'Oh, Goddess Ganga, you verily bear pregnancy with the potence of 
			Shiva, since this is the select process of all the gods.' So said Fire-god to 
			River Ganga. [1-37-12]

Shlok 13: "On listening that sentence of Fire-god, River Ganga adopted a celestial form 
			readying herself, and on seeing her glorious mien the Fire-god seeped throughout 
			her. [1-37-13]

Shlok 14: "The Fire-god then drenched River Ganga from all over with the potence of Shiva 
			which he contained so far, oh, Raghu's delight Rama, and every rill and channel 
			of Ganga is replete with it. [1-37-14]

Shlok 15- 16a: "River Ganga then spoke this to the Fire-god who is in the lead of all gods, 'oh, 
			god, I am incapable to bear up the rampant fervour of yours, and while being burnt 
			with the fire of god Shiva compounded with that of yours my life-force is very 
			highly tortured.' [1-37-15, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "He who consumes fire-oblations on behalf of all the gods, that Fire-god seeing 
			the miserable condition of River Ganga then spoke this to her, ''you may lay away 
			that embryo here at the side of Himalayan Mountains.' So said Fire-god to River 
			Ganga. [1-37-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: "Oh, great-resplendent Rama, on hearing the words of Fire-god, oh, charming prince 
			Rama, River Ganga indeed ejected that great-radiant embryo of Shiva from all her 
			rills and channels. [1-37-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: "Which refulgent embryo with the glitter of molten gold has emerged from River 
			Ganga is there that has reached earth, and from that the silver, and even the 
			gold with its matchless dazzle have emerged. [1-37-18]

Shlok 19b- 20: "In that process, copper and iron are also generated from that combustion of fires 
			of Shiva and Fire-god, and the residua have become tin and lead, and thus that 
			embryo on reaching the earth has evolved itself into various other elements also. 
			[1-37-19b, 20]

Shlok 21: "But, just when that embryo is laid down on Himalayan mountains, entire reed-garden 
			sprouted on that mountain is made brilliant by that glittering embryo and the 
			reed-garden itself has become golden. [1-37-21]

Shlok 22: "Oh, tigerly-man, from then onwards the gold with its brilliance equalling that 
			of the Fire-god is renowned by the name of jaataruupa 
			, one that retains its birth-time form, and oh, Raghava, everything on the mountain, 
			say grass, trees, climbers, and shrubs, all have become golden. [1-37-22]

[Commentary] The gold has the etymological name of jaataruupa 'birth-time-form.' 
			As and when Ganga's disgorged her womb there appeared a forest of fire like gold. 
			So, the gold glowing like fire is called gold at many places in Ramayana. Pt. 
			Satya Vrat.

Shlok 23: "Then for the boy who took birth from the embryo deposited in Himalayas, the Wind-gods 
			along with Indra have arranged Krittika stars to simultaneously suckle him. [1-37-23]

Shlok 24: "Those Krittika stars have decided among themselves that 'this boy shall be the 
			son for all of us,' and on making such a best resolve they suckled the just born 
			boy. [1-37-24]

Shlok 25: "All the gods have then said, 'this boy will be renowned in all the three world 
			as Kaarthikeya, as Krittika-stars have suckled him, with any doubt.' [1-37-25]

Shlok 26: "On hearing that blessing of gods Krittika stars gave a wash to that excellently 
auspicious boy who is radiant like fire, and who slid down from the secretion of 
the womb of Ganga. [1-37-26]

Shlok 27: "And gods called that boy, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, whose glow is like that of flaring 
			fire and who is ambidextrous as 'Skanda' for he slid down from the secretions 
			of a womb. [1-37-27]

Shlok 28: "Then an unexcelled milk instantly came forth from the breasts of the six Krittika-stars, 
			and becoming a six-faced one that boy too sucked that milk from the six Krittika-stars 
			at the same time. [1-37-28]

[Commentary] It is said that each of the six Krittika-stars came forward to give her milk firstly 
			to this boy. Observing their eagerness to feed him, Skanda / Kaartikeya made his 
			one face into six and sucked all the milk of all the six stars and become an adolescent 
			boy in day. Hence he looked like the one with six faces, by which he is called
			ShaNmukha, six-faced deity. Later he argues with his father Shiva that 
			he is superior to Shiva, because he has five-faces of Shiva, plus his own, totalling 
			to a six, and he is a six-faced deity, superior to the five-faced god, namely 
			Shiva. In another way, the boy by birth is dextrous and he sucked the milk of 
			all the six mothers in split second with one face, but it appeared to all deities 
			that the boy has been sucking milk with six faces, i.e., with rapid-face-movement. 
			Thus on establishing his ambidextrous personality, the gods nominate him as the 
			Chief of Celestial Army.

Shlok 29: "On sipping the milk just for one day he became an adolescent boy on that day 
			itself, and even though he is of delicate constitution as a boy, that taskmaster 
			triumphed over the army troops of demons by his own vigour. [1-37-29]

Shlok 30: "All of the celestial have then come together under the leadership of Fire-god 
			and they anointed that highly resplendent boy, Skanda, or Kaarthikeya, as the 
			Chief of Celestial Army troops. [1-37-30]

Shlok 31: "This way, I have vividly narrated the legend of Ganga to you, oh, Rama, like 
			that the Divine and Meritorious legend of the emergence of Kumara, namely Skanda 
			is also narrated. [1-37-31]

Shlok 32: "He who is a devotee of Kartikeyaa, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, he thrives with longevity, 
			also with sons, grandsons on this humanly earth in his mortal life, and on its 
			conclusion he becomes one with Skanda on journeying to Skanda's abode. [1-37-32]



SARGA 38
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra narrates the legend of Sagara, the earliest King of 
			Ayodhya and Rama's forefather, who is childless, but who begets 
			sixty thousand sons of merit and one son of demerit. Emperor Sagara 
			is the one who brought celestial Ganga onto the surface of earth..

Shlok 1: Describing that legend of Kaartikeya to Rama, the descendent of Kaushi, 
			namely sage Vishvamitra has further spoken this best sentence worded 
			melodiously to Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha. [1-38-1]

Shlok 2: "Once there was a valiant and virtue-souled king of Ayodhya named Sagara, 
			who is without offspring, as such he was longing for offspring. [1-38-2]

Shlok 3: "The daughter of King of Vidarbha, renowned by name Keshini, is the 
			eldest wife of Sagara, and she was virtue-minded, and an advocate of 
			truth. [1-38-3]

Shlok 4: "The daughter of Arishtanemi, namely sage Kashyapa, and who is also 
			the sister of Garuda, the Divine-Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, is the second 
			wife of Sagara, who is known by the name Sumati. [1-38-4]

Shlok 5: "Reaching the Himalayan Mountains along with his two wives that 
			great King Sagara practised asceticism on a mountain called Brugu-prsravana 
			for progeny. [1-38-5]

[Commentary] The Mt. Brugu-prsravana is said to be among Himalayan range on which 
			the kindness of Sage Bhrigu is ever- flowing.

Shlok 6: "On completion of a hundred years of ascesis, and when the Sage Bhrugu 
			is worshipped with asceticism, that sage who is a prominent one among 
			the patrons of truth bestowed a boon to Sagara. [1-38-6]

Shlok 7: " 'Oh, merited one, you will achieve very admirable progeny, and 
			oh, best one among men, you will also acquire an unparalleled renown 
			in the world. [1-38-7]

Shlok 8: " 'One of your wives will mother a son who enriches your dynasty, oh, 
			dear sire, and the other mothers sixty thousand sons.' Said Sage Bhrigu 
			to Sagara. [1-38-8]

Shlok 9: Highly gladdened are the daughters of kings of Vidarbha and Aristanemi, 
			i.e., the queens of Sagara, and on making palm-fold in supplication 
			at the sage who is speaking that way, and on gaining the grace of that 
			sage they spoke to him. [1-38-9]

Shlok 10: " 'Which of us will carry one son, oh, Brahma-sage, and which of us 
			begets numerous sons, we two wish to listen about that, oh, Brahman, 
			let your word betide truth.' Thus, the queens of Sagara spoke to the 
			sage. [1-38-10]

Shlok 11: On listening their words the Sage Bhrigu spoke in a glorious tone, 'let 
			your freewill be brought to bear this issue'. [1-38-11]

Shlok 12: 'Whether one wants one son who enriches dynasty, or whether numerous 
			sons who will be highly energetic, highly renowned, and highly enthusiastic. 
			Who wants which boon from either of them?' Thus, the Sage gave them 
			the option. [1-38-12]

Shlok 13: "On listening the words of the sage, oh, Rama, oh, delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty, the first queen Keshini has chosen one son who enriches the 
			dynasty in the presence of King Sagara. [1-38-13]]

Shlok 14: "Sumati, the sister of mighty-winged Garuda and the second queen of 
			Sagara has then chosen sixty thousand sons with great enthusiasm and 
			high reputation. [1-38-14]

Shlok 15: "On performing circumambulations to the Sage Bhrigu along with wives, 
			oh, Raghu's scion, also on reverencing him head-bent, the king Sagara 
			proceeded to his own city. [1-38-15]

Shlok 16: When the time rolled by then the elder wife Keshini gave birth to the 
			son of Sagara who is reputed by the name Asamanja. [1-38-16]

Shlok 17: But the second queen Sumati on part, oh, tigerly-man Rama, verily 
			delivered a round and long egg which is like a single gourd, and on 
			breaking it up sixty thousand sons are issued forth from that cucumber 
			like egg. [1-38-17]

Shlok 18: The childminders brought up those siblings in vessels filled with ghee, 
			the clarified butter, and after a protracted time all of the children 
			have attained youthfulness. [1-38-18]

Shlok 19: After a long time the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara have become 
			youthful, and handsome in their aspects. [1-38-19]

Shlok 20- 21a: But, oh, best one among men, oh, Rama, the elder son of the king Sagara, 
			namely Asamanja, always used to grab and hurl children into the waters 
			of River Sarayu, and on seeing the drowning children he used to enjoy 
			with laughter. [1-38-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: This way, when that son Asamanja is with sinister activity, a torturer 
			of goodmen, and delighter in the undesirable activities towards citizens, 
			his father king Sagara expatriated him from the city. [1-38-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] This Asamanja appears to be the person from the first-generation of 
			sadistic child abusers, prior to Kamsa of Bhagavata.

Shlok 22b- 23a: But Asamanja's son is a valorous one, who by name is Anshuman, and who 
			is an acceptable one for all people and who fondly converses with all. 
			[1-38 -22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: "Oh, best one among men, Rama, then after along time a decided thought 
			has occurred to king Sagara that, 'I shall perform a Vedic-ritual.'[1-38-23b, 
			24a]

Shlok 24b: That king Sagara who is an expert in Vedic-procedures has then taken 
			a decision along with the assemblages of his religious-teachers insofar 
			as the procedures of the ritual are concerned, and he commenced to perform 
			the Vedic-ritual. [1-38-24b, c]



SARGA 39
------------------------------

[Text] The ritual horse released by Emperor Sagara is snatched away by Indra 
			in order to cause hindrance to the ritual. The ritual cannot proceed 
			to culmination without the horse. Then Sagara orders his sixty thousand 
			sons to search for that horse, asking them to dig earth to trace it, 
			if it is not found on earth. And the princes will dig earth when they 
			have not found the horse on earth, to the grief of beings living in 
			netherworlds.

Shlok 1: On listening the narration of Vishvamitra, Rama, the delighter of Raghu's 
			dynasty is highly rejoiced, and at the end of the episode he spoke to 
			sage whose glow is fire like. [1-39-1]

Shlok 2: I am interested to listen this episode exhaustively, oh, Brahman, let 
			good betide you, how my ancestor Sagara had completed the Vedic-ritual, 
			really. [1-39-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: On listening the words of Rama that are inclusive of his inquisitiveness, 
			Sage Vishvamitra smilingly spoke to that descendent of Kakutstha, "oh, 
			Rama, let the episode of the great-souled Sagara be listened vividly." 
			Vishvamitra thus commenced to narrate that episode. [1-39-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: The father-in-law of god Shankara who is well-known by the name of 
			Himavan sets eyes on Mt. Vindhya, which stands as loftily as Himalayas, 
			and those two mountains peer at each other. [1-39-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: Oh, best one among men, Rama, that Vedic-ritual of Sagara started 
			in between those two mountains, namely Himalayas and Vindhya ranges, 
			and oh, tigerly-man Rama, that area is renowned for Vedic-rituals, isn't 
			it! [1-39-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Oh, dear sire Rama, the grandson of Sagara and the son of exiled Asamanja 
			is Amshuman, oh, descendant of Kakutstha, which Anshuman's bow will 
			be unfaltering and who is a top-speeded chariot-rider, and he has escorted 
			ritual-horse released. [1-39-6b, 7a]

[Commentary] Details regarding the release of horse are at Bala Kanda 1-14-1

Shlok 7b- 8a: And on the day of a sacred function called ukthyam 
			, Indra assumed the form of a demon and stole the ritual horse of the 
			chief of the ritual, namely Sagara. [1-39-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: While that ritual-horse of the great-souled Sagara is stolen, all the 
			congregations of the Ritviks, the religious-teachers, then spoke to 
			the chief propitiator, namely Sagara. [1-39-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: 'Oh, Sagara,the descendent of Kakutstha, at this auspicious time the 
			ritual horse is hastily diverted, you kill him who stole the horse, 
			and let that horse be fetched'. [1-39-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: 'This hindrance in Vedic-ritual will become inauspicious for all of 
			us, thereby, oh, king, action may be taken as to how there can be no 
			fault in proceedings of the ritual.' The religious-teachers of Sagara 
			have advised him in this way. [1-39-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On hearing the words of religious-teachers that king Sagara indeed 
			spoke this much to his sixty thousand sons in that religious-council. 
			[1-39-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: 'Oh, sons, I do not envisage any way in for demons into this ritual, 
			since oh, best ones among men, holy-sanctifiers who themselves are sanctified 
			by the Vedic-hymns are conducting this glorious Vedic-ritual, isn't 
			it. [1-39-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: 'Oh, sons, you may therefore proceed to search for the horse and its 
			thief on entire earth as far as it is garlanded by the ocean, and safety 
			betides you all. [1-39-13]

Shlok 14b- 15: 'Oh, sons, let each prince advance searching one square yojana of 
			earth, by my order you dig up the earth until the appearance of the 
			horse, while searching for the stealer of that horse. [1-39-14b, 15]

Shlok 16: 'As for myself, I will stay here only along with my grandson, namely 
			Amshuman, and with the congregation of religious-teachers till the horse 
			appears, as I am under vow of the ritual.' Thus Sagara instructed to 
			his sixty thousand sons and stayed back at the ritual place. [1-39-16]

Shlok 17: Animated by their father's words those great-mighty princes enthusiastically 
			proceeded onto earth's surface in the preliminary round of search. [1-39-1]

Shlok 18: But, oh, tigerly-man Rama, on going round the earth in its entirety 
			those great-mighty princes did not find that horse, then as said by 
			their father they mapped the earth to a unit of one square yojana for 
			each of them, and each of them hollowed out each and every area on the 
			surface of earth with their arms that have the touch of the diamonds. 
			[1-39-18]

Shlok 19: Mother Earth bewailed while she is ruptured with spears also that are 
			similar to thunderbolts, besides with very gruelling ploughs. [1-39-19]

Shlok 20: Oh, Raghava, there emerged an unbearable rumpus from the serpents, 
			asura-s, demons, and other beings living underneath the surface of earth, 
			while they are killed during hollowing the earth. [1-39-20]

Shlok 21: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, thus sixty thousand square 
			yojana-s of the earth is dug over, so as to make the earth's outermost 
			plane as the unsurpassed rasaatala, the 
			sixth subterranean and the nethermost plane. [1-39-21]

Shlok 22: Oh, the tigerly king Rama, the sons of Sagara have endeavoured everywhere 
			digging over the Jambu Island which is verily congested with mountains 
			in this way. [1-39-22]

[Commentary] The jambudwiipa is a continent according to Hindu mythology 
			where the total continents listed are seven.
			
			jambuuplakShaakhyadviipau shaalmaliH ca aparo dvija | kushaH krauncaH 
			tathaa shakaH puShkaraH ca eva ca saptamaH the seven continents 
			are jambu- plakSha - shaalmali- kusha - kraunca - shaka - puSkara, 
			and jambudwiipa is one among them.

Shlok 23: All the gods along with gandharva-s, asura-s, and reptiles who are 
			distraught at heart for the plight of earth have approached the Forefather, 
			Brahma. [1-39-23]

Shlok 24: They the gods who are very highly scared, and who are chap-fallen, 
			then spoke this sentence to the great-souled Forefather Brahma on gaining 
			his grace. [1-39-24]

Shlok 25: 'Oh, god Brahma, the sons of Sagara are digging entire earth, thus 
			aquatic beings and many great-souls are being destroyed. [1-39-25]

Shlok 26: " 'This one is the destroyer of our ritual... this one has carried off 
			our ritual horse...' thinking thus and suspecting everyone those sons 
			of Sagara are torturing all the living beings.' Thus all the gods have 
			appealed to Brahma." So said Sage Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-39-26]



SARGA 40
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishwamitra's narration of Sagara's legend is continued. Sagara's 
			sons dig out all the quarters of earth and when they enter northeast 
			to find out the horse thief, there they find Sage Kapila, i.e., Vishnu 
			in the semblance of a sage. When they wanted to attack that sage Kapila, 
			he renders them to heaps of ashes by his yogic powers.

Shlok 1: "On hearing the words of gods, the esteemed Forefather Brahma spoke 
			to them, who are very highly scared, and bewildered by the might of 
			Sagara's sons for they are effectuating the end of all beings." Vishvamitra 
			thus continued his narration. [1-40-1]

Shlok 2- 3: To whom this Mother Earth belongs in all her entirety, he is that 
			prescient Vasudeva, and she is also the consort of that Maadhava, and 
			that Vishnu eternally props up Mother Earth. Hence, that reverential 
			Vishnu donning the semblance of Sage Kapila will burn down the sons 
			of emperor Sagara to ashes in a fire of fury. [1-40-2, 3]

[Commentary] The islands / continents on earth, dviipa-s, are 'jambu- plaksha 
			- shaalmali- kusha - kraunca - shaka - puSkara'. And they are the seven 
			continents. Some say the earth is having nine continents, yet some others 
			prefer eighteen. However entire globe bhuudevi belongs to 
			Vishnu as she is his another consort.

Shlok 4: 'Even the complete cleavage of the earth, and the complete ruination 
			of Sagara's sons as well, are envisaged by the providentially farsighted 
			ancients." So said Brahma to gods. [1-40-4]

[Commentary] This is the cosmic routine. Every day of Brahma is one kalpa 
			and in each kalpa Brahma starts to create the universe afresh. 
			Though it is just like the bygone creation it is anew, but the presiding 
			souls of each object of the universe will change. If one soul presides 
			the Sun or the Moon in this era, in the next era they attain a higher 
			step in the ladder of 'snakes and ladders' called vaikunThapaali 
			and a soul-in-wait takes up the job of that Sun or Moon, just as good 
			as the promotions of officials. In this cosmic destruction even the 
			gods or godlike entities will be destroyed if they tend to cause unnecessary 
			ruination to the living beings 
			anena bahupraaNyupadravakaariNaam devaa api vadhopaayam abhiipsanti 
			- daivahataanaam ca teShaam avicaareNa naasho bhavati eveti suucitam 
			-dk This is the same even in the case of Indra. Vishnu 
			in His Trivikrama incarnation blesses the demonic Emperor Bali with 
			such Indra-hood in some era, when Bali's sin is counted down, and when 
			merit accrues.

Shlok 5: On hearing the words of the Forefather Brahma all the thirty three 
			gods went away with utmost satisfaction, as they have came. [1-40-5]

[Commentary] The gods that have come to appeal to Brahma are said to be thirty-three 
			in numbers. It is not that all the count of all the gods who have come. 
			There are others besides the prominent groups of thirty-three god-groups. 
			The thirty-three primary god-groups who have come here are aSTavasu-s 
			 'eight Vasu gods' ekaadasharudraa-s 'eleven Rudra 
			gods' ashvinidvaya twin brothers called 'ashvini-gods,' those 
			that are mostly connected with the administration of earth.

Shlok 6: When the sons of Sagara are digging the earth then there emerged an 
			unbearable noise similar to the crashing of a thunder. [1-40-6]

Shlok 7: Then on hollowing the entire earth, and on making trips around her 
			without finding the horse, all of the sons of Sagara have come together 
			and on going to their father they spoke these words to him. [1-40-7]

Shlok 8- 9: 'Entire earth is trekked and mighty beings like gods, demons, monsters, 
			evil-spirits, fiends, serpents, naga-s are also eliminated, but we have 
			not seen the ritual-horse or its stealer. What we have to do next. Let 
			a thought be given in this matter. Let safeness betide you.' So said 
			those princes to their father Sagara. [1-40-8, 9]

Shlok 10: On hearing that sentence of his sons, oh, Rama, descendent of Raghu, 
			that exalted king Sagara infuriately spoke these words. [1-40-10]

Shlok 11: 'Let the earth be dug further, may safety be with you, and verily 
			splitting open the surface of the earth you catch hold of the thief 
			of the horse, and on achieving your purpose you may return to me.' In 
			this way Sagara ordered his sons. [1-40-11]

Shlok 12: On catching up the words of their father, the great-souled Sagara, 
            his sixty thousand sons rushed towards the surface of the rasaatala, 
            the netherworld. [1-40-12]

[Commentary] The last but one mantle of the earth from its crust to its inner core, 
			is called rasaatala, in the seven-tier planes called, 
			atala, vitala, sutala, talaatala, rasaatala, paataala.. These are 
			not hells.

Shlok 13: While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly 
			elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth's 
			surface on its head. [1-40-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha 
			is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests 
			on its head. [1-40-14]

Shlok 15: On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant 
			moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will 
			occur on earth. [1-40-15]

Shlok 16: They circumambulated the great elephant in supplication, oh Rama, and 
			on worshipping that elephant which is the protector of easterly direction 
			they proceeded to netherworld duly splitting the earth. [1-40-16]

Shlok 17- 18: After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern 
			direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that 
			is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly 
			side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable 
			character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. 
			[1-40-17, 18]

Shlok 19: On circumabulating that elephant Mahaapada in supplication, they the 
			sixty thousand sons of great-souled Sagara scooped out the westerly 
			direction. [1-40-19]

Shlok 20: Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld 
			an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called 
			Sumanasa. [1-40-20]

Shlok 21: Circumambulating that elephant namely Sumanasa in western side, and 
			even on asking about its well-being, then they reached the northern 
			direction duly digging the earth. [1-40-21]

Shlok 22: In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white 
			elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth. 
			[1-40-22]

Shlok 23: On touching that elephant reverently and also circumambulating it, 
			those sixty thousands sons of Sagara further burrowed to the surface 
			of the earth. [1-40-23]

Shlok 24: The sons of Sagara have then gone to the auspicious northeast direction,
			iishaana-digbhaaga, Shiva-sthaana, and 
			all those sons of Sagara have tunnelled the earth rancorously. [1-40-24]

Shlok 25- 26: But all those great-souled and great-mighty ones with terrible dash 
			have seen the Infinite Vasudeva in the form of sage Kapila there in 
			the northeast, and oh, descendant of Raghu, they have also seen the 
			ritual-horse moving nearby that sage Kapila, thus all of the sons of 
			Sagara obtained a matchless delight. [1-40-25, 26]

Shlok 27- 28a: The eyes of the princes are agitated in fury in construing the sage 
			Kapila as the stealer of ritual-horse, and they furiously dashed towards 
			him wielding crowbars, ploughs, and various trees and boulders, and 
			shouting at him, 'stay, stay.' [1-40-27, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: You the malicious one, you have indeed stolen our ritual-horse, and 
			in fact, you should know that we who arrived here are the sons of Sagara.' 
			Thus Sagara's sons shouted at sage Kapila. [1-40-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: On hearing their words, oh, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, then sage 
			Kapila is beset with high wrath, and he boomed a 'hum' sound at them. 
			[1-40-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, then that great-souled sage Kapila, rather Vishnu 
			with unimaginable power, has rendered all of those sons of Sagara as 
			heaps of ashes by virtue of his 'hum' sound." Thus Sage Vishvamitra 
			is narrating the legend of Sagara to Rama and others. [1-40-30b, c]



SARGA 41
------------------------------

[Text] Amshuman's search for horse reveals that Kapila rendered his paternal-uncles 
			to ashes. When he wanted to offer water oblation as obsequies to their 
			souls he did not find water. Then Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu 
			and maternal uncle of Amshuman advises him to get River Ganga onto earth 
			whereby the souls are cleansed and they go to heaven. Amshuman reports 
			the same to King Sagara, but Sagara not finding any way to get River 
			Ganga onto earth departs to heaven at the end of his time.

Shlok 1: "On observing that his sons have gone long time back in search of ritual-horse, 
			oh, Rama, king Sagara spoke this to his grandson, Amshuman, who is radiant 
			with his own self-resplendence." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration 
			about Sagara. [1-41-1]

Shlok 2: 'You are brave one and completed your education in warfare, such as 
			you are, you are a coequal to your paternal-uncles in magnificence, 
			thus you search the course of your paternal uncles, also him by whom 
			the horse is stolen.' Thus King Sagara started speaking to his grandson 
			Amshuman. [1-41-2]

Shlok 3: The living beings in netherworlds of earth are intrepid and they 
			are extraordinary also, hence you take your bow along with your sword 
			to retaliate them in the event of their attacking you. [1-41-3]

Shlok 4: 'On saluting them that are worthy for salutations, and on eliminating 
			them that are the causer of obstructions, you shall achieve your purpose 
			of tracking the ritual-horse, and thus you comeback safely and let my 
			Vedic-ritual be crossed over to the other shore of mortality by you.' 
			Thus king Sagara told his grandson Amshuman. [1-41-4]

Shlok 5: When the great-souled king Sagara has thoroughly said in this way, 
			that adroitly agile Amshuman proceeded wielding a bow and a sword. [1-41-5]

Shlok 6: Motivated by the King Sagara, oh, Rama, the best one among men, Amshuman 
			progressed on the walkway that was hollowed out by his great-souled 
			paternal-uncles inside the earth. [1-41-6]

Shlok 7: And he that resplendent Amshuman beheld one of the four directional 
			elephant of the earth which is being venerated by gods, monsters, demons, 
			imps, vultures and serpents. [1-41-7]

Shlok 8: On circumambulating that elephant in supplication, and even on enquiring 
			after its well-being, he that Amshuman has enquired in detail with it 
			for his paternal-uncles and even about the robber of the ritual-horse. 
			[1-41-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing that enquiry of Amshuman that directional elephant with 
			great perception replied on its part saying, 'oh Amshuman, son of Asamanja, 
			on achieving your mission you will return expeditiously along with the 
			horse'. [1-41-9]

Shlok 10: On hearing that word of that directional elephant he departed from 
			there, and on sequentially reaching other directional elephants that 
			are abiding in other directions of earth, he commenced to ask the same 
			enquiry which he made with the first, according to the positioning of 
			elephants in directions, and according to the established procedures 
			of their venerability. [1-41-10]

Shlok 11: All the elephants that safeguard the directions of earth which have 
			the faculties of articulation and eloquence have adored Amshuman and 
			motivated him by saying, 'you will be going from here taking the horse.' 
			[1-41-11]

Shlok 12: On hearing that common blessing of all the directional-elephants, he 
			that nimble-footed Amshuman has gone to the place where his paternal-uncles, 
			sons of Sagara, were rendered as mounds of ashes. [1-41-12]

Shlok 13: But he on whom the control of anguish has chanced for not physically 
			seeing his paternal-uncles, that son of Asamanja then wept, as he is 
			highly agonised and extremely anguished at their destruction. [1-41-13]

Shlok 14: That tigerly-man Amshuman who is overwhelmed by agony and anguish, 
			also beheld there the horse of Vedic-ritual that is grazing nearby. 
			[1-41-14]

Shlok 15: When he that great resplendent Amshuman wanted to offer obsequial waters 
			to the departed sons of Sagara and searched for water he has not found 
			any fount of water. [1-41-15]

Shlok 16: Spanning his expert glances, oh, Rama, he then saw the rapid-winged 
			king of birds, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, who is the 
			maternal uncle of his father and other paternal-uncles, and whose flight 
			will be similar to that of the Wind-god. [1-41-16]

Shlok 17: That great-mighty son of Lady Vinata, namely Garuda, also spoke this 
			word to Amshuman, 'do not bemoan, oh, tigerly-man, this eradication 
			of your paternal-uncles is worthwhile to the worlds'. [1-41-17]

Shlok 18: In fact, Kapila, the Imponderable Sage, has burnt down those great-mighty 
			paternal-uncles of yours, oh, observant Amshuman, as such it will not 
			be apt of you to offer the mundane obsequial water-oblations to them, 
			indeed. [1-41-18]

Shlok 19: 'Oh, best one among men, River Ganga is the elder daughter of 
			Himavanta, and oh, dextrous one, you have to offer water-oblation to 
			the departed paternal-uncles of yours in her waters, namely the holy 
			waters of River Ganga'. [1-41-19]

Shlok 20: World purifier River Ganga will drift them who are rendered as mounds 
			of ashes to heaven, and when she who is much adored by all worlds drenches 
			this ash, that River Ganga herself will lead the sixty-thousand sons 
			of Sagara to heaven. [1-41-20]

Shlok 21: 'Oh, great fortunate one, oh, best one among men, you may proceed 
			from here with the horse, oh, brave one, it will be apt of you to carry 
			out the Vedic-ritual of your grandfather.' Thus Garuda said to Amshuman. 
			[1-41-21]

Shlok 22: On hearing the words of that great-winged eagle, Garuda, he that highly 
			brave and well-renowned Amshuman swiftly took the horse, and returned 
			to the ritual place of his grandfather, king Sagara. [1-41-22]

Shlok 23: Then on reaching the King Sagara, who is under the vow of the ritual, 
			oh, Rama, Amshuman described what all has happened and even the words 
			of Garuda. [1-41-23]

Shlok 24: On hearing those unendurable words from Amshuman, the king Sagara firstly 
			completed the Vedic-ritual scripturally and procedurally. [1-41-24]

Shlok 25: On completing the Vedic-ritual King Sagara arrived at his capital, 
			but that king could not arrive at a decision about the arrival of Ganga 
			to the earth. [1-41-25]

Shlok 26: "That great king Sagara could not get at any resolve in getting Ganga 
			to earth even after a long time, and on ruling kingdom for thirty-thousand 
			years he went to heaven." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
			the ancestors of Rama. [1-41-26]



SARGA 42
------------------------------

[Text] Bhageeratha's effort for bringing Ganga to earth is fulfilled. Amshuman 
			and his son Dileepa could not make any effort to bring the divine river 
			to earth. But Bhageeratha, the son of Dileepa, staunch at heart tries 
			earnestly to get her onto earth. Brahma agreeing for this descent of 
			Ganga designates lord Shiva to bear the burden of the onrush of Ganga, 
			because the earth cannot sustain it.

Shlok 1: "When King Sagara passed away owing to the irrefutable virtue of Time, 
			the ministers and subjects of that kingdom are predisposed towards the 
			highly honourable Amshuman to become their king and they enthroned him 
			accordingly." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration about the predecessors 
			of Rama. [1-42-1]

Shlok 2: "He that Amshuman turned out to be a very great king, and oh, Rama of 
			Raghu's delight, he begot a marvellous son who is renowned as Dileepa. 
			[1-42-2]

Shlok 3: Assigning the kingdom to Dileepa, oh, Rama of Raghu's dynasty, Amshuman 
			undertook very stern ascesis on a pleasant peak of Himalayas desiring 
			the descent of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-3]

Shlok 4: On practising ascesis in ascetic-woods for thirty-two thousand years 
			that highly renowned king Amshuman achieved heaven as he acquired only 
			the wealth of practising the ascesis. [1-42-4]

[Commentary] Instead of achieving reward of ascesis in the form of descent of River 
			Ganga, he could achieve only his personal merit of his penance, namely 
			an abode in heaven.

Shlok 5: The great resplendent Dileepa on hearing the elimination of his grandfathers, 
			the sixty thousand sons of Sagara at the hand of sage Kapila, and with 
			a mind that is marred by the plight of his father Amshuman in absolving 
			the souls of Sagara's sons, he that Dileepa could not arrive at any 
			decision concerning the descent of Ganga. [1-42-5]

Shlok 6: Dileepa became worried as to how River Ganga is to be alighted onto 
			earth from heaven, how water-oblations are to be offered for the souls 
			of Sagara's sons, and how to cross them, the souls, over this mortal 
			world. [1-42-6]

Shlok 7: To him who is self-mortified and who is always thinking righteously 
			about the alight of Ganga onto earth, to such a Dileepa a most-virtuous 
			son is born who is renowned by his name Bhageeratha. [1-42-7]

Shlok 8: That great-resplendent king Dileepa on his part performed numerous 
			Vedic-rituals, and he ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years - 
			to the delight of each of his subjects, but could not find a way to 
			fetch Ganga. [1-42-8]

Shlok 9: Oh, tigerly-man Rama, that king Dileepa by not attaining any choice 
			towards the uplifting the souls of his grandparents to heaven by bringing 
			Ganga to earth, he took to illness, and he attained the ultimate virtue 
			of Time, namely the demise. [1-42-9]

Shlok 10: That best one among men, namely king Dileepa, on anointing his son 
			Bhageeratha in the kingdom went to the abode of Indra, namely the heaven, 
			only by his self-acquired merits of deeds. [1-42-10]

Shlok 11: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, but on his part that self-righteous 
			and kingly-sage Bhageeratha is childless, and that great king longed-for 
			offspring. [1-42-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: Interested in the alighting of River Ganga on earth, oh, Rama, the 
			descendent of Raghu, king Bhageeratha delegated his kingdom to the custody 
			of his ministers and people and firmed up himself in sustained asceticism 
			on Mt. Gokarna in Himalayas, and he practise ascesis standing amid five-fires, 
			upraising his hands, with a monthly sustenance and with his sense conquered. 
			[1-42-12, 13a]

[Commentary] The five-fires are pancaagni-s the four earthly fires in four 
			corners of directions and the sun's fire overhead.

Shlok 13- 14: Thousands of years have rolled by while Bhageeratha stood practising 
			his severe ascesis, oh, dextrous Rama, and then the lord and master 
			of all beings, namely god Brahma, is well pleased with that great-souled 
			king's ascesis. [1-42-13b, 14]

Shlok 15: Forefather Brahma then arrived along with assemblages of gods, and 
			spoke this way to the great-souled Bhageeratha who is deep in the practise 
			of ascesis. [1-42-15]

Shlok 16: Oh, great king Bhageeratha, oh, lord of the people, I am delighted 
			with the perfectly conducted ascesis of yours, hence oh, truly committed 
			one, you may beseech for a boon. [1-42-16]

Shlok 17: That great resplendent and highly fortunate king Bhageeratha then remaining 
			with suppliantly adjoined palm fold spoke to him who is the Forefather 
			of all worlds, namely Brahma. [1-42-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, god, if you are satisfied with my ascesis, and if there is any 
			fruition to the ascesis of mine, let all the sons of Sagara get water 
			oblations through me. [1-42-18]

Shlok 19: While the ashes of these great souls are drenched with the waters 
			of Ganga, let all of those great-grandfathers of mine depart to heaven, 
			eternally. [1-42-19]

Shlok 20: Oh, god, I indeed pray for offspring in our Ikshvaku dynasty, let 
			not our dynasty dwindle as I am issueless, and oh, god, let this be 
			the other boon to me. [1-42-20]

Shlok 21: The Forefather of all the worlds, Brahma, then replied the king who 
			has spoken in that way, in an auspicious tongue that is sweet-sounding 
			and sweetly worded, as well. [1-42-21]

Shlok 22: Oh, top-speeded chariot-rider Bhageeratha, this aspiration of yours 
			is sublime, and oh, the furtherer of Ikshvaku dynasty, so be it, let 
			safeness betide you. [1-42-22]

Shlok 23: This Ganga is the one with snow-broth, the elder daughter of Himavanta, 
			and oh, king Bhageeratha, god Shiva alone is capable to sustain her 
			force in the course of her alighting onto earth, and in fact, he is 
			to be commissioned for that purpose. [1-42-23]

Shlok 24: 'Oh, king Bhageeratha, the earth cannot endure the downfall of Ganga 
			and to sustain Ganga, oh, king, indeed I do not behold none other than 
			the Trident-wielder, god Shiva.' Thus Brahma spoke to Bhageeratha. [1-42-24]

Shlok 25: "Speaking this way to the king Bhageeratha and informally greeting Ganga 
			also, that Creator of Worlds, Brahma, left for heaven along with all 
			the groups of gods and Wind-gods." Thus Vishvamitra continued narration 
			about the arrival of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-25]



SARGA 43
------------------------------

[Text] Ganga descends to earth by the extraordinary effort of Bhageeratha. 
			Shiva agrees to the alighting of Ganga on His head and from where she 
			is released into a lake called Bindu sarovar, and from there she flows 
			in seven courses. On land Bhageeratha ushers her up to netherworld dug 
			by his ancestors where heaps of ashes of his grandparents are there, 
			and she enters accordingly to inundate those mounds of ashes according 
			salvation to the souls.

Shlok 1: "When the god of gods Brahma left from there Bhageeratha stood on the 
			tip of his big-toe praying for the mercy of Lord Shiva for one year, 
			while that tip of his big-toe pressurised the earth." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about Bhageeratha's effort to bring Ganga to 
			earth. [1-43-1]

[Commentary] Bhageeratha stood on one big-toe with an unwavering intent and bodily 
			movement, and with his hands upraised in prayer for a period of one 
			year by day and night, sustaining himself on mere air, and thus his 
			yogic concentration increased and that alone pressurised the earth.

Shlok 2: On completion of one year, he who is venerated by all worlds, the consort 
			of Uma and the god of animals from insects to humans, that god Shiva 
			revealed himself and spoke this to the king. [1-43-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, best one among humans, I am delighted with your unwavering effort, 
			and I will fulfil your cherish. I will therefore sustain Ganga, the 
			daughter of king of mountains by my head. [1-43-3]

Shlok 4- 5a: Afterwards, she who is reverenced by all the worlds and who is the 
			elder daughter of Himavanta, that Ganga assuming an unendurable form 
			and an insupportable rapidity, they say, then plunged from the sky onto 
			the auspicious head of Shiva. [1-43-4, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: She who is an extremely unendurable river that goddess Ganga even speculated 
			saying to herself, 'let me enter netherworld, indeed whisking Shiva 
			with my streams.' [1-43-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Discerning her egotism god Shiva is infuriated, and then on his part 
			that Three-eyed god Shiva thought to pent her up in the tufts of his 
			head-hair. [1-43-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: And oh, Rama, she that holy River Ganga swooped down into the cavernous 
			curls of matted hair-tufts on the holy head of God Shiva, and she became 
			a detainee in them. [1-43-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: Though she strove hard in one way or another to reach the earth that 
			Ganga is rendered incapable, as she could not gain access for an outlet 
			from any edge of the coils of matted hair-tufts of Shiva, hence she 
			is held there in durance vile. [1-43-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Goddess Ganga whirled round and round in the coils of tufts alone for 
			many number of years, and when Ganga's emanation from those coils is 
			intangible Bhageeratha again firmed up in a marvellous penance in the 
			matter of her descent to earth. [1-43-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, with that ascesis of Bhageeratha god 
			Shiva is very much delighted, and thereupon he has also released Ganga 
			aiming at Bindu Lake in Himalayas. [1-43-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: While god Shiva released Ganga into Bindu Lake seven streams have emerged 
			out of it, and thus three auspicious Ganga-s with holy waters have cruised 
			eastward which are known as Hlaadini, Paavani, and Nalini. [1-43-11b, 
			12]

Shlok 13: Also thus Sucakshu, Seetha, and the excellent river Sindhu are the 
			other three rivers which streamed to the westward direction with their 
			holy waters. [1-43-13]

Shlok 14- 15a: Of them the seventh Ganga flowed towards the path of Bhageeratha' chariot, 
			and that great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting in a 
			divine chariot moved ahead and even Ganga followed him. [1-43-14, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Thus Ganga came from heavens onto Shankara's head and from there onto 
			the earth, and there on earth her waters advanced with a tumultuous 
			sound advancing them. [1-43-15b, 16a]

[Commentary] The River Ganga is also called as tripathagaa 'she courses 
			in three ways...' of which one kind of thinking is that she flowed from 
			Himalayas to heaven, from heaven to Shiva's head and from there to earth. 
			In the above context also, she is said to have the three-way-flow, i.e., 
			one is eastward flow, second westward flow and the third is southward 
			flow as led by Bhageeratha. The westward river Sindhu is the Indus and 
			the eastward Nalini, which is now called as river Brahmaputra, while 
			Ganga proper courses a little to south to move towards the ocean.

Shlok 16b- 17a: The earth then verily shone forth with the shoals of fish, schools 
			of tortoises, and scores of porpoises and other aquatic beings that 
			have already fallen and that are still falling in step with the spates 
			of Ganga. [1-43-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Later, they the gods, sages, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and the assemblages 
			of siddha-s have then seen there the swoop of Ganga in that way from 
			heaven to earth, with curiosity. [1-43-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Some of the gods with aircrafts that are like cities in their shape 
			and size, and some with horses that are prancing, and some with best 
			elephants that are staggering, at the very sight of plunging Ganga, 
			have entered the firmament at that place. [1-43-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: The gods whose animation is unlimited, and who are anxious to see the 
			plunge of Ganga, have come together in assemblages, which plunge is 
			a highest marvel in the universe by a better degree of her illimitable 
			animation than that of gods who came to see, and even benignant to the 
			world in according water and salving souls, which those gods cannot 
			do. [1-43-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: "The glitter of the ornaments of hosts of gods who are in stampede, 
			made the cloudless sky to shine as if it is with a hundred of suns. 
			[1-43-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: At that time, with the falling and rising of scores of porpoises and 
			reptiles, even with the wriggling fishes, the sky became flashy as if 
			flashes of lightning are strewn over it. [1-43-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Spattered innumerably with the whitish froth from the splashes of Ganga, 
			and stippled with the flights of swans, the sky is as though overspread 
			with silver-clouds of autumn. [1-43-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately, elsewhere sinuously, somewhere 
			else straightly, elsewhere sloppily, somewhere gushingly, and somewhere 
			else her cruise is leisurely and tardily. [1-43-23b, 24a]



Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately in declivities, elsewhere 
			sinuously on zigzag lands, somewhere else straightly on uniform lands, 
			elsewhere sloppily in canting lands, somewhere gushingly in craggy lands, 
			and somewhere else her cruise is leisurely in flatlands and tardily 
			in uplands.

Shlok 24b- 25a: Somewhere her water repeatedly knocking against her own water is recurrently 
			billowing upwards only to make nosedive onto earth. [1-43-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: That impeccable and immaculate water of Ganga then became outstanding 
			as it has flounced down from heaven primarily onto the head of Shankara, 
			and therefrom it has coasted down onto the earth. [1-43-25b, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: And asserting that the water as holy, because it descended touching 
			the body of Shiva, viz., the head of Shiva, the assemblages of sages, 
			gandharva-s, and those that are residents on the plane of earth have 
			sipped that water at that place. [1-43-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: Also those that have fallen from heaven onto the surface of earth by 
			some curse or the other, they too became blemishless on taking head-bath 
			in the water of Ganga. [1-43-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: When sins are washed away with the hallowing water of Ganga, they again 
			transited skyward and then obtained their own empyrean worlds once again. 
			[1-43-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: With her splendorous water people are blissful, and on taking dip-baths 
			in Ganga they are totally removed of the strains of their sins, and 
			they lived blissfully ever after. [1-43-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: In this way, the great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting 
			in a divine chariot continuously moved ahead and Ganga continually followed 
			him at his behind. [1-43-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] This verse is almost similar to the verse No. 14 above. But here, the 
			continuous actions of both the leader and the led are implied with ellipses 
			- 'in this way', and 'continuously.'

Shlok 31b- 32- 33a: Oh, Rama, all of the gods along with the assemblages of sages, ogres, 
			monsters, demons, and even great reptiles with kinnara-s, and gandharva-s 
			with best yaksha-s, and even serpents and apsara-s, have delightfully 
			moved after Ganga who is following the chariot of Bhageeratha, and why 
			they, in fact, all of the aquatic beings have followed Ganga. [31b, 
			32, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: In whichever direction king Bhageeratha has advanced, that glorious 
			River Ganga, who is the prominent river among all the rivers and the 
			complete obliterator of sins, has also moved at his behind in that direction. 
			[1-43-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: While in flow she started to completely inundate the field of Vedic-ritual 
			belonging to the great-souled sage Jahnu, who is of marvellous deeds 
			and who is presently an officiator of an ongoing Vedic-ritual. [1-43-34b, 
			35a]

Shlok 35b- 36a: But on knowing her hubris, oh, Raghava, that sage Jahnu has become 
			irritated and causing an extreme marvel he drank off all the water of 
			Ganga. [1-43-35b, 36a]

Shlok 36b- 37: Thereupon, the gods along with gandharva-s and sages at that extremely 
			marvellous feat of Sage Jahnu are highly astounded, and they then started 
			to worship that ablest human and great-souled sage Jahnu, and even deigned 
			for the daughterhood of Ganga to that high-souled sage Jahnu. [1-43-36b, 
			37]

Shlok 38: That greatly radiant and godly sage Jahnu is then delighted and released 
			Ganga from both of his ears. Therefore Ganga became the daughter of 
			sage Jahnu, and she is also renowned as Jahnavi, after the name of that 
			sage. [1-43-38]

Shlok 39- 40a: Even though Ganga again proceeded moving behind the chariot of Bhageeratha 
			and reached the ocean, therefrom she had to wend her way to netherworld, 
			once dug by the sons of Sagara, only to accomplish the mission of Bhageeratha, 
			namely drenching the ashes of Sagara's sons. [1-43-39, 40a]

[Commentary] Some take the word saagaram as the netherworld dug by the sons 
			of Sagara and omit the mention of her ocean-bound travel.

Shlok 40b- 41a: Even kingly-sage Bhageeratha making every effort ushered Ganga to netherworld, 
			but on seeing his grandparents rendered to ashes he has became doleful. 
			[1-43-40b, 41a]

Shlok 41b: "Oh, Rama, the best of Raghu's dynasty, then Ganga inundated that mound 
			of ashes of Sagara's six-thousand sons, by which those souls obtained 
			heaven, while the sins of souls are cleansed with the water of Ganga." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-43-41b, c]



SARGA 44
------------------------------

[Text] Brahma commends Bhageeratha in bringing Ganga onto earth which none 
			of his ancestors could do. Brahma blesses Ganga to be the daughter of 
			Bhageeratha. Brahma advises him to offer water-oblations to his manes 
			with the sanctified waters of Ganga.

Shlok 1: "King Bhageeratha followed by Ganga has gone to the ocean-like ditch 
			which is dredged up by the sons of Sagara, and entered the subterranean 
			of earth where the sons of Sagara are rendered to ashes." Thus Vishvamitra 
			continued his narration about the Descent of Ganga. [1-44-1]

Shlok 2: While the waters of Ganga are inundating those ashes, oh, Rama, then 
			Brahma, the lord of all worlds, indeed spoke this to the king Bhageeratha. 
			[1-44-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, tigerly-man Bhageeratha, the sixty thousands sons of great souled 
			Sagara have crossed over the sea of mortality, and on a par with the 
			gods they have also transited to heaven. [1-44-3]

Shlok 4: As long as the water of the ocean abides in the world, oh, king, 
			so long the sons of Sagara will abide in heaven like gods. [1-44-4]

Shlok 5: This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and hereafter she will 
			remain renowned in the world with the name associated with your deed 
			of bringing her onto earth. [1-44-5]

[Commentary] Otherwise, 'by your fatherhood she will be called Bhaageerathi and your 
			names becomes her surname.'

Shlok 6: Henceforth heavenly Ganga will be renowned as 'Triple-path-cruiser' 
			and 'Bhaageerathi,' as well, and as this river is sanctifying three 
			worlds, namely, svarga, bhuu, paataala loka-s, 
			'heaven, earth and netherworld' she will be remembered as the traveller 
			on triple path. [1-44-6]

Shlok 7: You may now offer water-oblations to all of your forefathers in the 
			waters of Ganga, oh, king, the lord of people, thus you may fulfil and 
			do away with the pledge of your requiescat. [1-44-7]

Shlok 8: Your ancestor Sagara is a highly glorious one and a best one 
			among righteous persons, oh, king, even then he has not achieved this 
			aspiration of alighting Ganga in his lifetime, but you have achieved 
			it. [1-44-8]

Shlok 9: Like that, your grandfather Amshuman, who is unequalled in his resplendence 
			in this world and who had been praying for the descent of Ganga, he 
			also could not dispense with this vow on fulfilling it. [1-44-9]

Shlok 10- 11: Oh, impeccable Bhageeratha, even by the kingly-sage Dileepa whose 
			resplendence is kindred to great sages, who is equal to me in his ascesis, 
			who is abided by the observances of ruling Kshatriya class, even by 
			such a highly fortunate and highly resplendent father of yours it was 
			impossible to bring Ganga in his turn, even though he had been supplicating 
			for the descent of Ganga throughout his lifetime. [1-44-10, 11]

[Commentary] The content of verse 10 at times will be attributed to verse 9, viz., 
			to Amshuman, rather than to Dileepa.

Shlok 12: But, you have accomplished that pledge, oh, the best one among men, 
			and in the world you have achieved highest renown which is highly adorable 
			by all. [1-44-12]

Shlok 13: That 'Descent of Ganga' is perfected by you, oh, enemy-represser, 
			and by this you have acquired a genuine basis for righteousness in this 
			world, and thereby a base for yourself in my world, namely Abode of 
			Brahma. [1-44-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, phenomenal one, you may always take dip-baths in the holy water 
			of Ganga and oh, persona grata, thereby get purified of sins and thus 
			let your merit be fructified. [1-44-14]

[Commentary] The waters of other rivers have a blemish called rajasvala doSa 
			'the blemish of menstruation.' When the sun is in Leo-Cancer, i.e., 
			during monsoon, and when new waters come in, it is as good as menstruation 
			for the ladies called, the rivers. But Ganga is beyond these taboos 
			because it is perennial, hence her is sanctifying. Some more details 
			are given in endnote of this chapter.

Shlok 15: 'You may now perform water-oblations to your forefathers with the 
			water of Ganga, let there be wellbeing to you, and oh, king, here I 
			go to my abode and you too may depart to yours.' Thus Brahma said to 
			Bhageeratha. [1-44-15]

Shlok 16: On saying in this way, the forefather of all the worlds, and the great 
			glorious lord of all gods, namely Brahma, went away to his empyrean 
			world as he has came. [1-44-16]

Shlok 17: On according those best water-oblations that endow superior realms 
			to the souls of sons of Sagara, according to precedency and the rationale 
			of scriptures, and even on offering water-oblations to other manes that 
			kingly-sage and greatly renowned Bhageeratha is sanctified, and then 
			only that king re-entered his own city, indeed when his purpose is completely 
			achieved, and oh, outstanding man Rama, thus that king Bhageeratha ruled 
			his kingdom well. [1-44-17, 18]

Shlok 19: On regaining him as their king the subjects of the kingdom are overjoyed, 
			and oh, Raghava, that king Bhageeratha too is relieved of his febrility 
			as his purpose is achieved and he is happy when devoid of haunting grief 
			of getting Ganga to earth. [1-44-19]

Shlok 20: Oh, Rama, this way I described to you about 'The Decent of Ganga' in 
			detail, thus you be blest and prosperous, and as the visceral time is 
			elapsing no more questions from you for now, and let us meditate on 
			Gayatri. But listen to the fruits of listening the legend of 
			ganga avataraNa, 'The Descent of Ganga' [1-44-20]

Shlok 21- 22a: This legend is conducive to achieve prosperity, fame, longevity, progeny 
			and even heaven, and he who narrates this legend to others, whether 
			he is from Brahmans or from Kshatriya-s, or for that matter of fact 
			from any other class, his manes will be satisfied, and gods too will 
			be gladdened. [1-44-21, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23: "Oh, Rama of Kakutstha-s, he who listens to this auspicious legend named 
			'The Descent of Gang,' which is an endower of longevity, all his wishes 
			are achieved, all his sins are obliterated, and his reputation and longevity 
			are also enhanced." Thus Vishvamitra concluded the episode of 'The Descent 
			of Ganga.' [1-44-22b, 23]

[Commentary] Almost every puraaNa, mythological treatise, deals with the sanctity of 
Ganga. It is therefore queried and counter-queried as to why and how she is sanctifying. 
Many treatises have detailed about it. This river emerges from the nail of the left 
foot's big-toe of Vishnu as said in Vishnu Puraana: gangaa devaanganaa angaanaam 
anulepanaa api pinjaraa | vaamapaadaambujaanguShTanakhasroto vinirgataa | visNorbhibharti 
yaam bhaktyaa shirasaa aharnisham dhR^ivam - sivaH Hence she took 
landing on Shiva's head. shankarasya shirasi bhraShTam patitam kalmaShaapahaa 
- maheshvara tiirtha 'the one who plunged onto Shankara's head and the very 
same is the remover of sins.'

[Commentary] Even if that river has fallen onto the head of Shiva at a later time, her original 
birth place is at the feet of Vishnu hence that river is sacred. After falling on 
the head of Shiva she is released and she rapidly flowed onto earth. Hence, her 
speed and rapidity alone are the sanctifying factors. nadii vegena shudhyati 
- govinda raaja 'a river cleanses itself by its rapidity.' As such, after incarceration 
by Shiva she flowed rapidly and thus her sanctity is kept up, by her very rapidity.

[Commentary] On bearing these sanctifying waters on his head, Shiva became a sanctified Shiva 
as said at sarit praparodakena tiirthena - candramaulividhR^itena shivaH shivo 
aabhuut - bhaagavatapuraaNa. Shiva presumed that he is honoured for the falling 
of Ganga on his head as said at tat ambupatitam dR^iShTvaa dadhaara shirasaa 
haraH | paavanaartham jaTaamadhye - mahaa bhaarata Even in aadhyaatma raaamayaNa
Sage Vashishta says to Vishnu tvat paadasalilam dhR^itvaa dhanyo bhuut 
girijaapatiH - aadhyaatma raamaayaNa 'on bearing your foot's waters Shiva 
became pious.'

[Commentary] In the legend of Trivikrama, dwarf-ascetic-boy, at one place it is said 
that due to the pressure of the foot of Vamana, the incarnation of Vishnu, the shell 
of the universe is pierced and water available outside has gone in and that water 
belonged to the Divine Ganga. At another place it is said when Brahma washed the 
feet of Vishnu that water from his kamanDulu'handy vessel' flowed as Ganga. 
Still at another place it is said that the dharmaitself flowed as Ganga 
at the behest of Brahma. These three are correlated and said that 'when Brahma washed 
the feet of Vishnu the waters were not sufficient enough to drench, then Brahma 
ordered dharmato flow like water, but that too was not enough, and when 
Vamana pierced the shell of universe then dharmaflowed as Ganga.

[Commentary] The yoga takes yet another viewpoint of Ganga. Their great guru is 
Shiva, and hence yogis say that every fraction of second Ganga, or cetana, 
vitality, flows in ones own body. tat paadapadmajam ga~Ngaam nipatantiim svamuurdhani | 
	cintayet brahmarandhreNa pravishantiim svakaam tanuum | tayaa sa~NkShaalayet 
deham baahyam abhyantaram malam | tat kShaNaat virajo mantra jaayate sphaTikopamam 
||According to the six-plexus theory cetana shakti, power of vitality, 
flows through brahma randhra'the hole in the mid of the pate' to sahasrakamalathe 
multi-petal-lotus, the Internal Capsule or the Reticular Activating 
System and from there to aaj~naa cakra' plexus of discrimination' back at 
the third eye, and from there the vitality flows down the lines of the three spinal 
nerves, viz., iDaa, pingala, suSumnasympathetic, parasympathetic and central 
spinal cord. These three are the three replicas of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. 
Their confluence occurs once at aaj~naa cakra' third eye' and again at the 
perineum and having gone to the perineum this Ganga activates the dormant particles 
of vitality to raise them up the spinal system. Thus, the Supreme Yogi Shiva ordains 
the vitality called Ganga to flow up and down the plexuses, from grey matter down 
to the perineum, only to activate the system. More Information than this will become 
unjustifiable here.

[Commentary] Ganga is ever holy because she does not have any womanly stigmas. dvimaasam 
saritah sarvaa bhavanti rajasvalaaH - maarkanDeya - - simhakarkaaTakayoH madhye 
sarvaa nadyaa rajasvalaaH - vyaaghrapaada 'for two months all the rivers menstruate' 
Maarkandeya Puraana. 'When sun in Leo-Cancer all rivers menstruate.' that is due 
to monsoon and new waters, as such bathing in them at that time is prohibitive. 
But River Ganga perennially draws its river water from Himalayas thus she has no 
such blemish.

[Commentary] For all these diverse opinions the reply is given in Ramayana itself as said in 
Ayodhya vishNupaadodbhavaam divyaam - ayodhyaand also at 1-43-7 of Ramayana
saa tasmin puNyaa - puNye rudrasya muurdhani - raamaayaNawhich imports 
the meaning: 'she that pious River Ganga, fell onto the pious head of Shiva,' i.e., 
'without any mutation, both Shiva and Ganga are the sanctifiers by themselves, while 
helping each other, i.e., Shiva helped Ganga to gain a foothold on His head, while 
Ganga helped Shiva to become the root cause to bear and release her brunt, and in 
turn, both of them helped the humankind.' Thus, what more can be sanctity than helping 
the created beings with one's own dharma.



SARGA 45
------------------------------

[Text] The legend of churning Milk Ocean is narrated to Rama and Lakshmana when they reach 
and see a city named Vishaala. Vishvamitra narrates how haalaahala, the 
lethal poison as well as Amrita, the ambrosial elixir emerged from the 
churning of Milk Ocean, and how Shiva contained the poison and how Vishnu helped 
the churning in His incarnation as Tortoise.

Shlok 1: On listening the narration of Sage Vishwamitra about Ganga's descent along with 
Lakshmana, Rama went into a great astonishment, and then addressed Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-1]

Shlok 2: The blessed legend you have narrated about the digging of an ocean at the behest 
of Sagara, Ganga's alighting, and Bhageeratha filling it with the water of Ganga 
is sacrosanct and even highly amazing. [1-45-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, enemy-inflamer, for two of us entire night rolled by as if it is a single moment 
while we were thinking about the episode you have narrated in its entirety. [1-45-3]

Shlok 4: While thinking about the auspicious legend of Ganga along with Lakshmana, oh, friend 
of the universe, Vishvamitra, whole night rolled by." Thus Rama is addressing Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-4]

[Commentary] Here the placement of verses does not give a continuity of narration in this version, 
insofar as Rama's speech is concerned. Other versions have a continuity of narration.

Shlok 5: Thereafter on the next fresh dawn the enemy-oppressor Raghava spoke these words 
to sage Vishvamitra, whose affluence is nothing but asceticism, and who by now has 
performed his daily chores of rituals. [1-45-5]

Shlok 6: We have listened the praiseworthy legend of River Ganga, and the deific night 
has also passed by while listening such a legend, we may now cross over the very 
same prominent and merited River Ganga, the tri-path-cruiser. [1-45-6]

Shlok 7: "This boat which is suitable for the embarkation of the sages whose deeds are pious, 
and which is comfortably blanketed with mats in its deck has come here, and indeed 
on knowing about the visit of your holiness to this place the sages have fetched 
it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-45-7]

Shlok 8: Hearing the words of great-souled Raghava, Vishvamitra of Kusha dynasty, started 
to cross over the River Ganga along with the assemblage of sages, and with both 
the Raghava-s. [1-45-8]

Shlok 9: Arriving at the northern bank of River Ganga they have honoured the group of sages 
who ferried them up to here and sent them off. Then sojourning on the riverbank 
of Ganga they have seen the city called Vishaala. [1-45-9]

Shlok 10: The great sage Vishvamitra then quickly started along with Rama and Lakshmana to 
the charming and admirable city Vishaala, which in comparison is like heaven. [1-45-10]

Shlok 11: Then Rama, whose flair for knowing everything is high, became suppliant duly adjoining 
his palms, and enquired about the prominent city Vishala with the great Sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-45-11]

Shlok 12: "Oh, great sage, which dynasty of kings is ruling from this city of Vishaala? Let 
safeness betide you, I am interested to hear of it and indeed I am highly inquisitive 
about it." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1- 45-12]

Shlok 13: Hearing that sentence of Rama then the eminent sage Vishvamitra has commenced to 
narrate the legend of ancient Vishaala. [1-45-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, Rama, I will tell you about the auspicious legend of Indra as I was told, and 
you listen to it as I tell. Oh, Raghava, indeed you may now listen to the quintessence 
of what has happened in this country. [1-45-14]

Shlok 15: Once in Krita era, oh, Rama, the sons of Lady Diti were extremely energetic, whereas 
the sons of her younger sister Lady Aditi were vigorous and highly righteous. [1-45-15]

[Commentary] Diti is the elder sister of Aditi and the first wife of Sage Kaashyapa. Her sons 
were originally called asura-s, and later given the nomenclature 
of raakshasaa-s, the demons. Lady Aditi the second wife of that sage Kaashyapa, 
gave birth to the progeny of sura-s, later generally called as
devataa-s, the gods. These two ladies are the daughters of Daksha Prajaapati.

Shlok 16: "Oh, tigerly-man, Rama, then those great-souls speculated as to 'how we can thrive 
without ageing, illness, and likewise without death.' [1-45-16]

Shlok 17: A thought occurred to those masterminds who were thinking on that matter clueing 
them up, 'we indeed can get elixir of life by churning the Milky Ocean.' [1-45-17]

Shlok 18: Deciding upon to churn the Milky Ocean then made Vasuki, Thousand-headed King of 
Snakes, as the churning rope and Mt. Mandara as stirrer, and those brothers whose 
energy is unlimited have started churning the Milky Ocean thoroughly. [1-45-18]

Shlok 19: After a thousand years, the Thousand-headed serpent Vaasuki, which is being 
used as churning rope, is incapacitated to bear the friction of churning and fanged 
the cliffs of Mt. Mandara. Thereby a great lot of venom is disgorged from the heads 
of that serpent Vaasuki, which venom on melting the rocks of Mt. Mandara became 
the holocaustic poison called haalaahala. [1-45-19]

Shlok 20: A lethal poison similar to inferno known as haalaahala has started to fulminate 
therefrom, by which whole universe of gods, non-gods and humans is burnt down. [1-45-20]

Shlok 21: The gods seeking shelter then approached Rudra, the Cardinal God, Endower of Solace, 
and who husbands all the created animals inclusive of human-animals, namely Shiva, 
and they prayed to him saying 'save, save us.' [1-45-21]

Shlok 22: This way while the gods are praying the Lord and God of Gods, namely Shiva, then 
handling his disc and conch-shell Vishnu has also revealed himself at that place. 
[1-45-22]

Shlok 23: And Vishnu smilingly spoke to wielder of trident Rudra, 'oh, god the best, whatever 
element that has emerged from the churning of Milk Ocean by gods, that shall belong 
to you, isn't it. By virtue of your position as the foremost god among gods, oh, 
omnicompetent god Shiva, you please accept this poison applying yourself to that 
position of foremost god, and deeming this poison, haalahala, as a foremost oblation 
to your godhood'. [1-45-23, 24]

Shlok 25- 26a: Saying so Vishnu, the best one among gods, has disappeared then and there only. 
And on observing the scare of gods and also on paying heed to the words of the Wielder 
of Bow called shaar~Nga, namely Vishnu, god Shiva gulped that lethal poison,
haalaahala , as if it is ambrosia. [1-45-25, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27a: The god of gods Hara then left for his abode Kailash parting with other gods, and 
oh, Rama, the joy of Raghu's dynasty, the gods and non-gods have continued to churn 
the Milky Ocean. [1-45-26b, 27a]

Shlok 27b- 28a: Now the loftiest mountain that is being used as stirrer, namely Mt. Mandara, has 
caved into the netherworld, thereby the gods along with gandharva-s have prayed 
to Madhusuudana, the other name of Vishnu. [1-45-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b- 29a: 'You alone are the recourse to all beings, especially to the dwellers in heavens, 
oh ambidextrous god Vishnu, you safeguard us, it will be apt of you elevate the 
mountain.' So prayed gods to Vishnu. [1-45-28b, 29a]

Shlok 29b- 30a: Hearing the prayer of gods Vishnu, Hrisheekesha, the controller of senses, adopting 
the form of a tortoise and positioning the stirring Mt. Mandara on that tortoiseshell, 
he lay recumbent at the bottom of Milky Ocean as a base to the stirrer. [1-45-29b, 
30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: Keshava then reached out his hand and grasped the mountaintop as he is the Cosmic-Soul, 
and thus staying amid gods that Supreme Person Vishnu participated in churning the 
ocean by holding the stirring mountain upright. [1-45-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32: After a thousand years of churning, then a male personality, an epitome of Life 
Sciences, namely aayurveda , a highly righteous soul, named Dhanvantari, 
has firstly surfaced with his arm-rest-stick and with his handy water-vessel, and 
then the remarkably elegant Apsara-s, angelic damsels, have emerged next to him 
from the Milky Ocean. [1-45-31b, 32]

Shlok 33: Choicest females have come out an elixir obtained on absolute churning of the waters 
of Milk Ocean, oh, best one among men, Rama, thereby that genera of females became 
Apsara-s. [1-45-33]

Shlok 34: Six hundred millions of such Apsara-s with amazing dazzle have emerged from the 
churning of Milky Ocean, oh, descendent of Kakutstha, and their maidservants who 
emerged along with them are innumerable. [1-45-34]

Shlok 35: Anybody either from gods or demons espoused them, and when none espoused them they 
are virtually reckoned as 'general-purpose' Apsara-females. [1-45-35]

[Commentary] In fact these Apsara-s are the nymphs who really did not bother to choose husbands 
either from gods or from demons and they wanted to be free and out of the institution 
of marriage. But later they alone have become breeding centres as in the case of 
Menaka-Vishvamitra et al. Because they have come out from apsu rasa 'waters... 
elixir, those that emanated from the elixir of water.' Etymologically this nomenclature 
'seems more to be guided by the similarity of sound than anything else,' and 'we 
have a case of sound etymology par excellence [in Ramayana,] in sura, asura
and the word asura is formed from the word asu with the addition 
of the suffix ra and means 'one full of ra spiritual life i.e.,
asu and 'by curious process of semantical change came to mean a demon.' 
Pt. Satya Vrat - Ramayana - A Linguistic Study.

Shlok 36: Oh, descendent of Raghu, then the heaven-sent damsel Vaaruni came up from Milky 
Ocean searching for her espousal, who is the daughter of Varuna, the Rain-god, and 
who incidentally is the presiding deity of hard liquors and also called as sura. 
[1-45-36]

Shlok 37: Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of 
Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have 
espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. [1-45-37]

Shlok 38: Thereby the sons of Diti are called asuraa-s, and the sons of Aditi are 
called suraa-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni. 
[1-45-38]

Shlok 39: Then a best horse called Ucchaishravaa has emerged, oh, Rama, the best among men, 
and then a gem of a jewel, called Kaustubha, and like that amrita, the 
Supreme ambrosial elixir of gods, have also emerged. [1-45-39]

Shlok 40: Owing to the dispute regarding the possession of that ambrosia, oh, Rama, then 
there chanced a rampant ethnic havoc, and then the sons of Aditi have havocked the 
sons of Diti. [1-45-40]

Shlok 41: All the asura-s and demons have come to one side against sura-s, and there occurred 
a very gruesome war which was perplexing to all the triad of universe viz., ethereal, 
real and surreal spheres. [1-45-41]

Shlok 42: When everything is wading into annihilation then that omnicompetent Vishnu swiftly 
impounded Amrita, the Divine Elixir, by assuming his illusory power of Mohini. [1-45-42]

[Commentary] Mohini literally means 'that which bewitches' and usually described as a feminine 
or neutral power of Vishnu, personified by a bewitching divine female. Thus Vishnu 
is said to have assumed a physique of such a voluptuous and bewitching seductress, 
marvellously limbed, and mantled in see-thru clothing, and thus maddened everybody 
around her. Then she started to serve Amrita/Ambrosia among the gods and demons 
on making them to sit on either side of her way. Even the age-old Brihaspati, the 
Jupiter, sitting in god's row, has come under her charm and started gazing her from 
top to toe, pruriently. When Brihaspati saw the feet of that damsel, they appeared 
as male person's feet. He further looked at those two feet and beholding them as
shrii caraNa, 'Reverential Divine Feet of Vishnu,' with which he covered 
the three spheres, Brihaspati's illusion is shattered and he venerated those feet, 
recognising this as Vishnu's Maya, illusory power.

Shlok 43: Whoever confronted that Eternal and Supreme Person, namely Vishnu, in that war, 
then Vishnu whose blaze is threefold as manifest in the sun, fire and lightning, 
has pulverised him. [1-45-43]

Shlok 44: In this horrendous war between the progeny of Diti, namely demons, and the progeny 
of Aditi, namely gods, the sons of Aditi being gods, have altogether massacred the 
demonic sons of Diti. [1-45-44]

Shlok 45: "On eliminating the demonic sons of Diti and on acquiring kingdom of heaven, that 
eliminator of enemy cities, namely Indra, happily ruled the worlds that are inclusive 
of sages and caarana-s." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Vishaala 
city and its emergence. [1-45-45]





[Commentary] Legend/puraaNa: Once, when Indra was riding his elephant Iravata, Sage 
Duurvasa came towards him and offered a garland, respecting Indra as the administrator of the universe. 
Indra decorated that garland on the head of his elephant and that elephant removed it and trampled. 
By this Duurvasa, who is an angry sage by himself, is angered and curses Indra to fall from the grace 
and all his luxurious paraphernalia be submerged in ocean. Accordingly, Indra looses everything and 
becomes destitute, and he then approaches Vishnu. Vishnu reprimands Indra for ridiculing elderly sages 
like Duurvasa and then plans to churn the ocean to retrieve all the lost treasures. Thus, the legend 
and the churning are going on for ages.

[Commentary] From the kundalini / power of yoga point of view the churning of ocean 
is continually going on in everyone's body. The body is the ocean and at its abyss, the triangle in 
the perineal or sacral plexus is the base of Mt. Mandara. The churning rod is the spinal cord in the 
rod like backbone and the churning strings are the ida, pingala namely, 
the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The churners are the air elements of vital forces on either 
side. This total system is held upright by Vishnu because He is naaraayaNa, nara 
+ aayaNa 'one who conducts humans, say created beings, into being and lead them away, again into 
His own self...' When kundalini power is incited the first results are 
always negative like, haalaaha, 'the lethal poison...' and all all-ruinous 
ills befall on us. If this negativity is surrendered to someone who can handle it effortlessly, like 
Shiva, then the positivity results like Amrita/Ambrosia. Even if this elixir 
of life is readily available, there will be still better lures, lusts, and longings like Mohini and 
if enchanted by those instantaneous quirks, which are yet another kind of negativity, we will be lost 
completely, like the demons. Hence 'churn the correct way...' is the postulate of yoga.







SARGA 46
------------------------------

[Text] Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have 
			killed her sons in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, 
			being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, with view to destroy 
			that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the 
			procedure of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into 
			seven fragments, which later become saptamarudgaNa-s, The Seven Wind-gods.

Shlok 1: "Oh, Rama, Lady Diti was highly anguished for those sons that are killed 
			and said this to her husband, Sage Kashyapa, the son of Sage Maareechi." 
			Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-46-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, god, I am bereaved of my sons who are killed by your great mighty 
			sons, the sons of your second wife Aditi, as such I wish to bear a son, 
			who is achievable by sustained penance, for he shall be the exterminator 
			of Indra. [1-46-2]

Shlok 3: 'Such a bereaved mother as I am, I wish to undertake asceticism for 
			a son who shall become an exterminator of Indra, and who shall be the 
			ruler of worlds. As such, it will be apt of you to permit me for asceticism, 
			and further it will be apt of you to accord me pregnancy with such a 
			son.' Thus Diti spoke to her husband Kaashyapa. [1-46-3]

[Commentary] A sage's wife requires permission of her husband if she wishes to undertake 
			an individual asceticism, because she will be receiving her own share 
			of merit from her sage-husband's penances and practises, as he is her 
			life-mate.

Shlok 4: On hearing her request the great resplendent sage Kaashyapa, the son 
			of Sage Mareechi, replied Diti, who is deeply mournful. [1-46-4]

Shlok 5: " 'So be it... oh, ascetically wealthy lady, you be blest, if you abide 
			by the propriety of the practises of asceticism, then you will be delivering 
			a son who can become an exterminator of Indra in war. [1-46-5]

Shlok 6: 'If you can complete a thousand years of asceticism punctiliously, 
			by my grace you can deliver a son who can be a husbander of three worlds.' 
			Thus Sage Kaashyapa advised his wife Diti. [1-46-6]

[Commentary] In some other versions the word trailokyahantaaram is carried 
			forward from earlier verses of Diti, into the speech of Sage Kaashyapa 
			also. Some have it as trailokyabhartaaram 'a husbander of 
			three worlds...' Diti may have desired for a 'killer.' But Kashyapa, 
			as a father of both gods and demons, cannot term the issuing son as 
			an exterminator of three worlds, because the three worlds are in vogue 
			at Kaashyapa's grace. Some attach this adjective to Indra but not to 
			the forthcoming son of Diti.

Shlok 7: Saying thus that great resplendent sage patted her, and then on his 
			touching her she is consecrated, and then that sage Kaashyapa departed 
			for his ascetic practises, saying 'be blest.' [1-46-7]

Shlok 8: On the exit of Sage Kaashyapa, oh, best one among men Rama, highly 
			elated Diti reached the sacred place called Kushaplava, on which the 
			present City of Vishala is now standing, and practised a highly rigorous 
			asceticism. [1-46-8]

Shlok 9: While she is truly practising asceticism, oh, the best among men Rama, 
			that Thousand-eyed god Indra has indeed rendered services with his abundant 
			and surpassing veracities to her, who is none other than his maternal-aunt. 
			[1-46-9]

Shlok 10: The Thousand-eyed god Indra made available fire, firewood, water, the 
			sacred Kusha grass, fruits and like that tubers also, and whatever other 
			items she required in her ascetic practise. [1-46-10]

Shlok 11: All the time Indra indeed served Diti by massaging her body, and other 
			means of removing her bodily strain resulting from her arduous practises. 
			[1-46-11]

Shlok 12: Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, when ten years are less to complete 
			the thousand years span of her ascetics, Diti is highly rejoiced as 
			her ambition is going to fructify in just ten more years, and then she 
			spoke to the Thousand-eyed god, Indra. [1-46-12]

Shlok 13: Oh, best one among the valiant ones, Indra, to me who am practising 
			asceticism ten years are remaining to complete, then you can see your 
			brother, you be safe. [1-46-13]

Shlok 14: Oh, son Indra, whom I am bringing up for your reason, I will bring 
			him up as a victory-enthusiast, and oh, son, Indra, along with him conquering 
			the three worlds you can enjoy them, without febrility from your enemies.



Oh, son Indra, whom I am now bringing up, will be enthusiastic in 
			conquering you, but somehow I will manage him by telling that you are 
			after all his brother, and no harm shall be done to you, and oh, son 
			Indra, if you join him you will get rid of your febrility, caused by 
			his emergence, and then you two can conquer all the three worlds. [1-46-14]

Shlok 15: Oh, best one among gods, Indra, on my prayer your high-souled father 
			Sage Kaashyapa bestowed this boon on me for a son, which materialises 
			at the end of thousand years, and only ten more years are to slip by. 
			[1-46-15]

Shlok 16: When Diti was saying thus, the noontime sun was reigning high that 
			lady is stolen over by sleep keeping her feet headward. [1-46-16]

[Commentary] This 'keeping feet headward' is variously inferred. While sitting she leaned on 
her knees and her braid touched feet, thus she became impious. She slept with her 
head neither towards east nor to south. The ancient cots in India used to have head-side 
and feet-side finishing. Then she placed head at feet-side and feet at head-side. 
Even if a cot is not there, though slept on ground, the head shall be positioned 
eastward or southward, but not to north or west. Finally, she slept at noontime, 
and for a person under a vow noontime sleep is prohibitive.

divaa svaapaH paadasthaane shiraH sthaapanam ca ashucikaram iti suucitam - dk 
Hence her meticulousness is defeated.

Shlok 17: On observing her who has become impious by placing her head at feet-side 
			and braid falling on feet, Indra is gladdened and laughed at her failed 
			asceticism. [1-46-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, Rama, being a highly courageous one, Indra the destroyer of enemy 
			fastnesses, entered the body of Diti through her vaginal aperture and 
			rent her foetus asunder into seven fragments. [1-46-18]

Shlok 19: Oh, Rama, then that foetus wailed clamorously while being sliced with 
			Thunderbolt that has hundred cutting edges, and then Diti woke up. [1-46-19]

Shlok 20: 'Do not scream, do not scream...' thus Indra was coaxing the foetus, 
			and even though that foetus is screaming piteously the great resplendent 
			Indra has gone on fragmenting it. [1-46-20]

Shlok 21: 'Unkillable, unkillable is my foetus...' thus Diti raved in that way, 
			and then Indra fell out of the womb honouring his stepmother's entreaty. 
			[1-46-21]

Shlok 22: Indra humbly folding his palms that are still handling his bloody Thunderbolt 
			spoke to Diti, 'oh, lady, you have become impious when your braid touched 
			your feet and when you have gone to sleep in midday, and you vow is 
			thwarted.' [1-46-22]

Shlok 23: "Thereby I gained a chance to eliminate him who can eliminate Indra 
			in a battle. Hence I fragmented your foetus into seven fragments, and 
			it will be apt of you to pardon me for that act of mine." So said 
			Indra to lady Diti. Thus, Sage Vishvamitra continued narration about 
			City of Vishaala. [1-46-23]



SARGA 47
------------------------------

[Text] The legend of Seven-Maruts, the Seven-Wind gods, and the legend of the kings of Vishaala 
are narrated to Rama and Lakshmana, while Vishvamitra is narrating the legend of Vishaala. At the request 
of Diti, Indra blesses the seven segments of her foetus to become saptamarudgaNa-s, 
Seven Wind gods, and the place where the legend of Indra-Diti has happened, that province 
later became the City of Vishaala.

Shlok 1: "Diti was highly anguished when her foetus is rendered into sevenfold, and spoke these 
appeasing words to the indomitable Thousand-eyed Indra." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about 
City Vishala. [1-47-1]

Shlok 2: 'Oh, Indra, the eliminator of demon Bala, this foetus of mine is sliced into seven 
segments owing to my own misdeed, oh, ruler of gods, Indra, indeed there is no iniquity of yours in 
this matter.' Thus Diti started speaking to Indra. [1-47-2]

Shlok 3: Though a reversal has happened against my thinking in the matter of my pregnancy, 
let these seven segments become your seven Wind-gods, the rulers of seven ethereal-places, under your 
ruler-ship. [1-47-3]

[Commentary] According to mythology there are seven ethereal places in cosmos on which the galaxies 
and planets are dependent. According to Vishnu Puraana: aavahapravahavashcaiva 
samvahaH ca udvaH ca tathaa | vihaakhyaH praivaahaH paraavaheti kramaat || 
gaganaH sparshanaH vaayuranilaH ca tathaaparaH | praaNaH praaNeshvaraH jiiva iti 
ete saptamaarutaaH || They are: aavaha the air called by this name 
will be pervading in clouds, thunderbolts, rain, meteors; pravaha air in 
solar orbit; samhava in lunar orbit; udvaha in galaxies; vivaha 
in planetary spheres; parivaha in the Seven-Sages sphere; varaavaha 
in north polar regions. These are otherwise called by names gagana, sparshana, 
vaayu, anila, praaNa, praaNeshvara, jiiva. Each of the Marut god has a batch 
of seven Marut-s, thus they are forty-nine entities, in total.

Shlok 4: Oh, son Indra, let these seven sons of mine become the seven presiding deities of 
Cosmic Air Divisions and let them move in heaven with heavenly forms. [1-47-4]

Shlok 5: One from the seven may permeate Brahma's abode, likewise another may permeate the 
heaven of Indra, and even the third one, let him become a greatly celebrated and reputed as Divine Wind, 
and he may circulate in entire universe. [1-47-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: 'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, let four of my sons permeate four directions according to 
time and at your command, let safety betide you, and let them be renowned verily by the name given by 
you as 'Marut,' because you have coaxed the crying fragments of foetus saying, 'maa ruda, maa ruda, 
'do not cry, do not cry...' Thus Diti said to Indra. [1-47-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On hearing her words, the Thousand-eyed destroyer of enemy's citadels and a demon named 
Bala, namely Indra, spoke this word to Diti, humbly adjoining his palms. [1-47-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9- 10a: " 'All this will happen as you have said, undoubtedly, and your offspring, the Maaruta-s, 
would be pervading in the forms of gods, you be safe.' Thus Indra assured Diti. Those two, the stepmother 
Diti and the stepson Indra, on arriving at a decision in that ascetic forest, departed to heaven fulfilling 
their purposes. Thus we heard the legend." Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-47-8b, 9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, this province is that one which was once presided over by Indra, 
and where he rendered services to that accomplished one in her asceticism, namely lady Diti. [1-47-10b, 
11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: To king Ikshvaku of Vishaala, oh, tigerly-man Rama, a highly righteous son was born 
through queen Alambusa, and he was renowned as Vishaala. There is a city in this place constructed by 
him and known by his own name, Vishaala. [1-47-11b, 12]

[Commentary] These Ikshvaku-s of Vishaala are not the Ikshvaku-s of Ayodhya, i.e., of Solar Dynasty. 
The Bhaagavata Puraana says separately in its seventh canto about this dynasty of Ikshvaku-s of Vishaala.

Shlok 13: "Oh, Rama, Vishaala's son is the great-mighty Hemachandra, and Hemachandra's son is highly 
renowned as Suchandra.. [1-47-13]

Shlok 14: "The son of Suchandra became famous as Dhuumraashva, and oh, Rama, Dhuumraashva derived 
his son named Srinjaya. [1-47-14]

Shlok 15: The fortunate and valorous son of Srinjaya is Sahadeva, and the son of Sahadeva is the 
most righteous Kushaashva. [1-47-15]

Shlok 16: The highly resplendent and dauntless Somadatta is the son of Kushaashva and Somadatta's 
son is highly reputed as Kakutstha. [1-47-16]

Shlok 17: Presently that Kakutstha's son named Sumati, who is a great-resplendent one, an unconquerable 
one, and a highly celebrated one is dwelling in this city. [1-47-17]

[Commentary] These two Ikshvaku and Kakutstha are of Vishaala dynasty. They are not to be confounded 
with the grandparents of Rama.

Shlok 18: By the grace of Ikshvaku, the successive kings of Vishaala have longevity, intrepidity, 
well-off in generosity, and they were great-souled ones. [1-47-18]

Shlok 19: "Today we may gladly go to sleep here for a night, and oh, best one among men, and it 
will be apt of you to see Janaka, the King of Mithila tomorrow morning." Thus Sage Vishvamitra spoke 
to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-47-19]

Shlok 20: The best one among best men, a widely reputed and the highly resplendent king of Vishaala, 
namely Sumati, having heard that Vishvamitra has arrived at the precincts of the city, came to him for 
a warm welcome. [1-47-20]

Shlok 21: King Sumati arrived along with his mentors and family members, offered an excellent veneration 
to Vishvamitra, and then spoke to the sage with adjoined palms enquiring about his well being. [1-47-21]

Shlok 22: "To which province you have visited that happens to be mine, thereby I could get an audience 
of yours without stirring myself from my country, hence none will be more fortunate than me." So said 
king Sumati to Vishvamitra. [1-47-22]



SARGA 48
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra narrates the legend of Ahalya to Rama and Lakshmana when 
			they arrive at the precincts of Mithila, bidding farewell to the King 
			of Vishaala. Indra is infatuated with Ahalya desires a union with her, 
			for which she complies. However, Gautama catching them unawares curses 
			both Indra and Ahalya.

Shlok 1: When those two, Vishvamitra and Sumati, have met one another there at that place, 
king Sumati raised the topic of Rama and Lakshmana, after exchanging greetings and 
enquiring about the well-being of the great-saint Vishvamitra. [1-48-1]

Shlok 2: "These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious 
elephants and arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine 
bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching 
that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness 
in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals 
have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have 
come here, and whose scions are they? [1-48-2, 3, 4]

[Commentary] The word deva can easily be said as a 'god' but, this is said to be Vishnu, 
as implied at 4-43-56 of Kishkindha 'There the Cosmic-Souled God, namely Vishnu...' 
etc. Now the enquirer himself is no less than a godly king, hence he identified 
the boys as non-terrestrial. No fatherly person accepts youngsters to footslog miles 
and miles, and so far this is an unobserved and an uncared for aspect by other sages 
and saints, because all of those sages and saints are footsloggers. This may be 
one of the reasons for Dasharatha in refusing to send Rama with Vishvamitra. However, 
King Sumati, being a glorious and fatherly king brought up this topic. Vishvamitra 
is giving a 'rehearsal' for these brothers for their real forest trekking later 
in the legend. Further, if a divine deed is to be done and a benefit therefrom is 
to be acquired, one has to footslog. Now Rama is going to perform a divine feat 
called 'bending the bow of Shiva' and thereby winning the hand of an unusual princess 
Seetha, in marriage. Hence, he footslogged this much distance for siitaakalyaaNaartham, 
lokakalyaaNaartham Seetha's marriage, which is for the 'universal 
goodness.'

Shlok 5: "These two best ones among men are identical to one another by their bodily proportion, 
facial-language, and by bodily gestures, and with their presence they refurbish 
this province like the Moon and Sun brightening the firmament. In truth, I would 
like to know for what reason these valiant ones who are wielding best weapons have 
arrived here travelling on an arduous path." Thus, king Sumati asked Vishvamitra. 
[1-48-5, 6]

[Commentary] The word facial-language translated for ingita may be an extended expression 
for the  body language. This word is for the voice muted facial expressions, given 
through smiles, eyebrows, lip movement etc. A person could be analysed by these 
very expressions as we presently call this as face reading. This is what Sugreeva 
says when sending Hanuma to Rama and Lakshmana for the first time, 'because you 
are an expert in reading faces, know them by their facial expressions...'

Shlok 7a: On hearing those words of King Sumati, Vishvamitra informed him about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, also about the elimination 
of demons, as it has happened. [1-48-7a, 7b]

Shlok 7c- 8: King Sumati is highly astonished to hear the words of Vishvamitra about the visit 
of Rama and Lakshmana, and treating them to have come as the most prominent and 
honour-worthy guests that king started to honour those two great-mighty sons of 
Dasharatha customarily. [1-48-7c, 8]

Shlok 9: On getting high honours from King Sumati, Raghava-s stayed there along with Vishvamitra 
and with the community of sages for one night, and then they all have moved on to 
Mithila. [1-48-9]

Shlok 10: On seeing Janaka's auspicious city Mithila, all of the saints who are accompanying 
Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana, extolled it saying, "Splendid! Splendid!" and 
admired it highly. [1-48-10]

[Commentary] Ayodhya is not fortunate enough to receive any worship from the onlookers, but it 
will be admired for its fortification. However, Mithila is a venerable city, because 
by itself it is a temple town and the Vedic-rituals etc., will be going on forever. 
It is a blessed place as it has Shiva's Bow, for which bow ritual worship is be 
ongoing from time immemorial.

Shlok 11: On seeing a hermitage in the fringes of Mithila, that appeared to be age-old, but 
now uninhabited, yet pleasing, Rama asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-48-11]

Shlok 12: "This is semblable to a hermitage but sages seem to have discarded it. Oh, venerable 
sage, whose is this hermitage previously, I wish to listen of it." Thus, Rama asked 
Vishvamitra. [1-48-12]

Shlok 12: On hearing that sentence spoken by Raghava, the expert in sententiousness, a great 
resplendent sage and eminent-saint Vishvamitra replied him in this way. [1-48-13]

Shlok 14: What a pleasure! You may listen as I narrate, Raghava, whose hermitage is this 
factually, and which great soul has resentfully cursed this. [1-48-14]

[Commentary] The pleasure expressed by Vishvamitra is for the arrival of time, for the event 
of Rama's grace, in releasing Ahalya from her cursed state.

Shlok 15: Oh, the best one among men Rama, this hermitage with a heavenly glisten, and highly 
hallowed even by gods, once belonged to the great-souled sage Gautama. [1-48-15]

Shlok 16: In this hermitage, oh, prince Rama, once that highly renowned Sage Gautama sat 
tight in asceticism for numerous cycle of years along with his wife Ahalya. [1-48-16]

Shlok 17: On knowing the meantime of Gautama's availability at hermitage, Indra, the husband 
of Shaci Devi and the Thousand-eyed god wearing the guise of sage Gautama and becoming 
such a sage, approached Ahalya and said this to her. [1-48-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, finely limbed lady, indulgers do not watch out for the time to conceive, 
as such oh, slender-waisted one, I desire copulation with you. [1-48-18]

[Commentary] Vividly: Oh, Ahalya, Brahma crafted you so well that all your limbs are symmetrically 
conjoined, so who in the universe will not yearn to have intercourse with you... 
and on seeing your slender waist and thickset hips I wish to copulate with you now 
itself... and let there be no fear of safe period or unsafe period for I do not 
wish to have any progeny of mine from you...

Shlok 19: Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, though knowing him as the Thousand-eyed Indra in 
the guise of her husband Gautama, she is inclined to have intercourse ill-advisedly, 
only to satisfy the impassion of the King of Gods. [1-48-19]

[Commentary] Her thinking is: This is none but Indra in the guise of my husband, for my husband 
never asks me like this nor he violates times... I heard that Indra is seeking me 
for a long time... and when King of Gods expresses such a desire, it cannot be refused... 
let him have it

Shlok 20- 21a: She felt fulfilled in her heart of hearts and then she said this to that best god 
Indra, 'I am gratified in complying with your wish, oh, best of gods, get going 
oh, lord, from here quickly, oh, ruler of gods, always safeguard yourself and me 
from Sage Gautama.' Thus, Ahalya said to Indra. [1-48-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: Indra on his part smilingly said this word to Ahalya, 'oh, well-hipped lady, I 
am quite delighted, here I go as I have came.' [1-48-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Oh, Rama, Indra then came out of the cottage flustering hurriedly after copulating 
with her with an uncertainty about the arrival of Sage Gautama. [1-48-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24- 25a: Indra looked at Gautama..the one who is great saint, inaccessible to gods and demons, full of ascetic power,
purified with holy water, bright like fire, holding Samidha-s and kusha grass in hands,
and eminent Sage entering into the hermitage. [1-48-23b, 24, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26: On seeing the sage the lord of gods Indra is scared and became dreary-faced. Then 
the well-behaved Gautama furiously spoke these words on seeing the ill-behaved Thousand-eyed 
Indra who is donning the guise of a saint. [1-48-25b, 26]

Shlok 27: 'Oh, dirty-minded Indra, taking hold of my form you have effectuated this unacceptable 
deed, whereby you shall become infecund.' Thus, Gautama cursed Indra. [1-48-27]

Shlok 28: When that great-souled sage Gautama spoke that way with rancour, the testicles 
of the cursed Thousand-eyed Indra fell down onto ground at that very moment. [1-48-28]

Shlok 29: On cursing Indra thus the sage cursed even his wife saying, 'you shall tarry here 
for many thousands of years to come without food and consuming air alone, and unseen 
by all beings you shall live on in this hermitage while contritely recumbent in 
dust.' [1-48-29, 30]

Shlok 31: When that unassailable son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, arrives at this squalid 
forest, for it will be henceforth rendered so along with you, then you will be purified. 
[1-48-31]

Shlok 32: 'On your welcoming Rama, oh, ill-behaved woman, you will be divested of your greed 
and craze in which you lingered so far, and then you will assume your own body and 
then you can be in my proximity, rejoicingly.' Thus, Sage Gautama cursed his wife 
Ahalya. [1-48-32]

Shlok 33: "On cursing immodest Ahalya thus, that great-resplendent Sage Gautama shed this 
hermitage which was once adored by celestials like siddha-sand caarana-s, and that 
great-ascetic Gautama practised his asceticism on the pleasant peaks of Himalayas." 
Thus, Vishvamitra continued his narration about the legend of Ahalya. [1-48-33]



SARGA 49
------------------------------

[Text] Ahalya is redeemed from her curse when Rama enters their hermitage. 
			Vishvamitra while continuing the narration of the legend of Ahalya asks 
			Rama to enter her hermitage where Ahalya is living unseen by anybody. 
			When once Rama steps into that hermitage she manifests herself from 
			her accursed invisible state. She emerges with her divine form and accords 
			guestship to Rama and Lakshmana. Sage Gautama also arrives at this juncture 
			to accept his depurated wife Ahalya.

Shlok 1: The emasculated Indra then with panicked eyes spoke to gods, siddha-s, gandharva-s, 
and carana-s, keeping Fire-god as their helms-god. [1-49-1]

Shlok 2: I have Indeed incited fury in that noble-souled Sage Gautama by effectuating 
hindrance in his asceticism, but I have accomplished a task of gods. [1-49-2]

[Commentary] Indra is a position assigned to some high-souled being on acquiring considerable 
merit. He functions as a CEO of the universe, maintaining seasons, rains, thunders, 
thunderbolts, crops, earthquakes, and every aspect of nature, whether they are good 
or bad for us. If any Vedic-ritual were performed, this Indra would be too happy, 
as he and his deputies like Rain-god, Fire-god, Air-god, et al., will receive many 
oblations from that ritual. But if it is tapas 'the practise of asceticism, 
penance, or ascesis' by single sage, Indra will be highly perturbed. Usually sages 
will be practising this ascesis for attainment of higher abodes of Brahma, Vishnu, 
or Shiva. Some practise this to overthrow present Indra and try ascending to his 
position, or to attain immortality and thereby rout out Indra, as with the case 
of Ravana. When that practise is about to materialise, Indra sends his agents, like 
voluptuous celestial beauties, namely the apsara-s, to infatuate those sages with 
their beauty. Once the sage's concentration fails, his practise becomes futile. 
Thus, Indra retains his present position. Here, though Sage Gautama did not practise 
his ascesis for Indra's post, Indra had to hinder it in his own apprehension, and 
when the fury of Gautama is incited, Gautama's practise also failed and he had to 
redo his ascesis until he overcomes his passions. Thus, this 'causing hindrance' 
is a divine-act as proclaimed by Indra to other gods. In doing such 'divine-acts' 
Indra will also be maligned, for which the higher gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, 
or other higher beings will come to his rescue.

Shlok 3: By Gautama's anger I am rendered testicle-less and his wife Ahalya is also rejected 
by the sage, and thus by his releasing a severe curse his propriety for ascesis 
is dwindled, therefore his ascesis is pre-empted by me. [1-49-3]

Shlok 4: 'Therefore, oh, all gods with the assemblages of sages and caarana-s, it will 
be apt of you to make me virile again, as I have acted for the benefit of gods.' 
Thus Indra spoke to all gods. [1-49-4]

Shlok 5: On hearing the words of the officiator for Hundred-Vedic-rituals, namely Indra, 
all of the gods and other assemblages of celestials, together with the groups of 
Marut-gods came to the godly manes keeping the Fire-god in van, and appealed. [1-49-5]

Shlok 6: 'This ram is with testicles and Indra is indeed rendered testicle-less. Taking 
the testicles of this ram they may be given to Indra quickly.' Thus Fire-god started 
his appeal to manes. [1-49-6]

Shlok 7: 'This ram that is being offered to you shall now be gelded to give its testes 
to Indra, and though this ram is deprived of its organ it will be complete and it 
endows complete satisfaction to you. To those humans who hereafter offer testes-less 
rams in sacrifices for the purpose of your gratification, you shall truly offer 
them plentiful and unmitigated benefits.' Thus Agni, the Fire-god spoke to manes. 
[1-49-7]

[Commentary] The 'manes' are the deified souls of dead ancestors. It is customary to offer 
un-castrated or unmutilated animals in sacrifices to please gods or departed souls. 
Presently some humans have offered such an un-castrated ram to manes and the manes 
are about to enjoy it. But the gods have come and Agni, the Fire-god, is asking 
them to part with such an offering, for the sake of Indra. And when the manes were 
hesitating to go against the existing rules of ritual, then Agni, the Fire-god, 
is amending those rules and he is saying a boon-like proclamation. 'From now, the 
manes can enjoy even a castrated ram, if offered by humans on earth, and in turn 
the manes shall afford plentiful benefits of undiminished value to those offerers, 
namely humans...'

Shlok 8: On hearing the words of Agni, the Fire-god, the manes-gods who gathered to collect 
their share of offering have extricated that ram's testes, which is not yet sacrificed 
but tethered to a sacrificial post, and offered them to the Thousand-eyed Indra. 
[1-49-8]

Shlok 9: Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, from then onwards the manes-gods who come to collect their 
share are enjoying even the goats, even if they do not have testes, to endow benefits 
thereof to those that offer those goats, and to join the testes of goats to Indra. 
[1-49-9]

[Commentary] If rams with testes are offered the manes discard the testes of those rams and enjoy 
the rest of it. Even if a goat is offered they enjoy it, considering it as homogenous 
to a ram. In either way, the offerer is blessed with benefits and Indra with testes.

Shlok 10: Oh, Raghava, owing to the efficacy of the great-souled Gautama and his ascesis, 
from then onwards Indra has became one with the testes of a goat. [1-49-10]

Shlok 11: "Therefore, oh, great-resplendent Rama, enter the hermitage of Gautama whose deeds 
are pietistic, and atone Ahalya who is highly fortunate and who is in the compose 
of a divinity." Thus Vishvamitra spoke to Rama. [1-49-11]

Shlok 12: On hearing Vishvamitra's words Rama entered the hermitage along with Lakshmana and 
keeping Vishvamitra afore. [1-49-12]

Shlok 13-15: She whose splendour is brightened by her ascesis, at whom it is impossible to raise 
an eye for a stare either for gods, or for demons, or for the worldly beings on 
coming close to her, whom the Creator has contrived with careful contemplation as 
an angelic and a completely phantasmal entity, who is like the befogged and beclouded 
moonshine of a full moon as she is hitherto enshrouded by the dried up leaves and 
dust, who is like an unwatchable sunshine mirrored in and glowing from the midst 
of water, for she is hitherto in the midst of denounce, and whose limbs are like 
the tongues of a flaring fire around which fumes are cloaking, as she is hitherto 
practising an utmost ascesis subsisting on air alone, which ascesis alone made her 
like a flaring Ritual Fir, and Rama has seen such a highly glorious Ahalya. [1-49-13, 
14, 15]

Shlok 16: Ahalya is indeed indiscernible to all the three worlds by the very word of Gautama 
until the manifestation of Rama. [1-49-16a, b]

Shlok 16c- 17a: On reaching the end of curse she came into the view of Raghava-s, and they too gladly 
touched her feet in reverence. [1-49-16c, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: Reminiscing Gautama's words Ahalya received those two, and self-consciously offered 
water for feet and hand washing, and like that she also offered guestship customarily 
and dutifully, and Rama of Kakutstha on his part acquiesced her hospitality. [1-49-18]

Shlok 19: There chanced an abundant floral fall form firmament to the drumbeats of god's drums, 
and the celestials like gandharva-s, apsara-s revelled in a splendid festivity that 
is superb. [1-49-19]

Shlok 20: Gods have collectively reverenced her, whose limbs are depurated by the asset of 
her ascesis which is performed as a devotee of Gautama remaining in his directives, 
saying 'Gracious! Goodness!' [1-49-20]

Shlok 21: Even that great-resplendent Gautama is heartened when he reunited with Ahalya after 
a long, long a time, and that sage customarily reverenced Rama for actualising his 
solemn utterance, and that great-ascetic Gautama continued his ascesis together 
with Ahalya. [1-49-21]

Shlok 22: Even Rama on receiving a conventionally high veneration in the manifestness of that 
great-saint Gautama himself, then moved ahead to Mithila. [1-49-22]

[Commentary] The legend of Ahalya is viewed from many viewpoints, because it is unclear whether 
she is a humanly lady or a divine entity, or a tract of land.

[Commentary] The atheists, rather materialists, in their translation of Ramayana take this Ahalya, 
according to their viewpoint, as an uncultivable tract of land by saying that is
a halya un, ploughed...land' Thereby Rama rendered 
it as a cultivable land in the course of his socio-economic reforms. There are many 
other instances in relating these mythical accounts of Ramayana to the earthly plane. 
Another instance is lavaNaasurasamhaara elimination 
of Saline Demon...' and Rama's elimination of this demon is taken as treatment of 
saline oceanic water as potable waters...'

[Commentary] When the mythology is touched upon, it says that Ahalya is lying there as a stone 
and by the touch of Rama's foot she regained her divinely human form. This is not 
evident in Valmiki Ramayana. The idea of petrifaction of Ahalya is brought in from
PadmaPuraana which says: saa tataH tasya raamasya paadasparshanaat 
mahaatmanaH | abhuut suruupaa vanitaa samaakraantaa mahaashilaa || by the touch 
of the feet of that great souled Rama, she was manifest as a divine damsel, getting 
rid of her stone-shape...' Further, there will be an exchange of words between Indra 
and Brahma in Uttara Kanda of Ramayana, and there this episode of Ahalya recurs. 
At that place Brahma defines hala as - distorted shape...' and a halya 
is one with an impeccable beauty...' Besides the above, Indra will be usually addressed 
as sahasraakSha - thousand eyed one...' and behind this legend, there 
is another legend, saying that Gautama's curse to Indra is: since you delighted 
with Divine Ahalya, who is crafted by Brahma, in carnal pleasures, let there be 
thousand carnally vaginal apertures on your body...' Then that Indra is agitated 
for such an appearance, pleads for mercy. Then, the curse is amended saying 'instead 
of vaginal apertures, the apertures on your body will look like eyes...' thus Indra 
became sahasraakSha.

[Commentary] F. Max Muller records in his History of Sanskrit Literature' the commentary of Kumaarila 
Bhatt, yet another ancient commentator on Ramayana. "In the same manner, if it is 
said the Indra was the seducer of Ahalya. This does not imply that the God Indra 
committed such a crime, but Indra means the Sun and Ahalya the night, from [the 
words] ahaH the 'day' and lil the 'night'; and as the night is 
seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning, there is Indra called the paramour 
of Ahalya."

[Commentary] Dharmaakuutam views this as paatityam, patita falling from practise of 
virtuousness' Such women are said to be accepted by men after making their amends 
for their faults. tathaa svaruupanaasham kR^itvaa vaayubhakSha ityaadi vayonuurpashaapapradaanena

[Text] Rama arrives at Mithila along with Lakshmana led on by Vishvamitra. On hearing that Vishvamitra has 
arrived at their city Mithila, King Janaka proceeds to him welcomingly. On seeing Rama and Lakshmana 
near at Vishvamitra, Janaka inquisitively asks Vishvamitra about these two princes. Vishvamitra announces 
them as the sons of Dasharatha and informs about the adventurous deeds the boys have undertaken.

Shlok 1: Rama then travelled along with Lakshmana towards northeast direction keeping Vishvamitra afore and neared 
the hall of Vedic ritual of Janaka in Mithila kingdom. [1-50-1]

[Commentary] The northeast is an auspicious direction, and even today it is held high for any ritual or in the architecture. 
This direction is presided over by iishaana The God.

Shlok 2: Rama who is with Lakshmana spoke to the tigerly saint Vishvamitra, " the Vedic-ritual of noble-souled 
Janaka is excellent, indeed with bountifully garnered paraphernalia of the ritual. [1-50-2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, highly fortunate sage, this place abounds with many thousands of Brahmans who are experts in Vedic 
practises and who seem to be the dwellers of numerous provinces, and also discernable are the cottages 
of sages rife with hundreds of carts full with their ceremonial chattels, as such oh, Brahman, a campsite 
may be decided for us too, as I discern every inch is inhabited." Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-3, 
4]

Shlok 5: On hearing the words of Rama that great-saint Vishvamitra arranged a camp at an unfrequented place that 
has refreshing water. [1-50-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: On hearing that Vishvamitra has arrived in Mithila, then the best king Janaka instantly forged ahead 
towards Vishvamitra, keeping his unreprovable priest Shataananda afore of the team, in deference to 
Vishvamitra. [1-50-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: Even the Ritvik-s, the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, of the great souled king Janaka arrived 
with post-haste taking holy waters, and they have ritualistically offered that sanctified water to Vishvamitra. 
[1-50-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: On receiving that veneration from the great souled Janaka, Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of 
the king Janaka, as well about the unhindered proceedings of that Vedic-ritual. [1-50-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Then Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of saints, mentors, clerics, as befitting to their order, 
and joined the company of all of the sages as a happy-souled sage. [1-50-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: The king Janaka adjoining his palms then spoke to that eminent-sage Vishvamitra, "oh, reverend sage, 
please be seated on this high seat, along with these eminent saints in their respective seats." Thus 
Janaka spoke to Vishvamitra [1-50-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On hearing the words of Janaka that great-sage Vishvamitra took his seat, and king Janaka also took 
seat along with his royal priest Shataananda, and the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, namely Ritvik-s, 
and along with his ministers. [1-50-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: On beholding all of them seated all about in their respective seats as demanded by procedure king Janaka 
then spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Today my Vedic ritual is enriched with your advent, whereby I deem that gods have fructified the ritual. 
Let the ritual be like that. I deem that I have obtained the fruit of the ritual just on seeing godlike 
you here today. [1-50-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Oh, Brahman, at which Vedic-ritual hall you have arrived along with so many sages that happens to be 
mine, whereby, oh, eminent saint, I feel that I am honoured and hallowed. [1-50-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Oh, Brahma-sage, the scholarly Ritvik-s conducting my Vedic-ritual are saying that only twelve more 
days are remaining to complete the observation of ritual-pledge, and then oh, Kaushika, it will be apt 
of you to see the gods who arrive at the conclusion of this Vedic-ritual expecting their due in the 
ritual." So said king Janaka to Vishvamitra. [1-50-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: On speaking to that tigerly sage Vishvamitra in this way, the king again asked the sage pointedly and 
inquisitively with adjoined palms and with a gladdened face. [1-50-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19: These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and arrogant 
lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, 
and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals 
and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals have chanced 
on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have come here, and whose scions are 
they? [1-50-17b, 18, 19]

[Commentary] These foots are the same as king Sumati's dialogue at 1-48-2, 3, 4 including anvaya , parsing.

Shlok 20- 21: Oh, great-saint, whose sons are these two valiant youngsters who are brandishing best weapons? They 
are embellishing this province as the Sun and Moon doeth the sky. Each to each they are clonal by postural-language, 
by facial-language and by body language. They appear valorous but boyish in their appearance, as their 
curls are still jet-black like crow-wings. Thus, whether they are immature by age though mature by their 
valour or so, I wish to listen about them in actuality. [1-50-20, 21]

[Commentary] Import of verses is the same as at 1-48-5, 6, with a little difference in anvaya , parsing.

Shlok 22: On hearing the words of great-souled Janaka, Vishvamitra whose anima is immeasurable, has announced 
that those two as the sons of king Dasharatha. [1-50-22]

Shlok 23: The highly resplendent great-saint Vishvamitra has informed the high souled Janaka about the coming 
of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, their stopping over there and elimination 
of demons at that place, their indefatigable travel along with him, beholding City of Vishaala, seeing 
Ahalya, her reuniting with Sage Gautama, likewise their coming hitherward to gain a grasp of great bow 
of Shiva. On informing all these incidents to Janaka as well as to Shataananda, who incidentally is 
the son of Ahalya, sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-50-23, 24, 25]



SARGA 51
------------------------------

[Text] Enquiring about his father Gautama's reuniting with his mother Ahalya, Sage Shataananda 
relates the legend of Vishvamitra. Shataananda greets Rama for his adherence to 
the rectitude of Vishvamitra, which Vishvamitra gained through a series of self-important 
exploits, when he was a great king at one time. Shataananda finds worth in informing 
the biography of Vishvamitra to Rama, because too much of overbearing of kings, 
as has been done by Vishvamitra, will be unbecoming for kings.

Shlok 1: On hearing that sentence of that intellectual sage Vishvamitra, the highly refulgent 
and the great ascetic Shataananda is overjoyed, and Sage Shataananda, the eldest 
son of Sage Gautama, and whose radiance is brightened by his own ascesis is highly 
amazed just on seeing Rama. [1-51-1, 2]

Shlok 3: On raptly observing those two princes who are sitting comfortably with their heads 
bending down submissively, then Shataananda spoke to the eminent sage Vishvamitra. 
[1-51-3]

Shlok 4: Oh, tigerly saint Vishvamitra, you have revealed my glorious mother Ahalya who 
meted out a marathon ascesis to the princes - Really! [1-51-4]

Shlok 5: And the highly resplendent and celebrated mother of mine worshipped Rama, who is 
worthy of worship by every corporeal being, with forest produce, is it so! [1-51-5]

Shlok 6: Oh, great-resplendent Vishvamitra, you have narrated to Rama about the maltreatment 
of my mother by the Providence as has happened anciently, isn't it![1-51-6]

Shlok 7: Oh, the best sage Kaushika, you be safe, my mother is reunited with my father on 
beholding and giving hospitality to Rama - Really! [1-51-7]

Shlok 8: Oh, Kaushika, my father came to my mother's place from Himalayas! Has the great 
resplendent father of mine worshipped Rama because the redemption of my mother is 
per the kindness of Rama! Has this great-souled Rama reverenced that great resplendent 
father of mine by according a redemption, ahalyaa-daana, 
the endowment of Ahalya to her husband. [1-51-8]

Shlok 9: "Oh, Kaushika, on his arrival at my mother's place whether this reverential Rama 
reverenced my father with a pacified heart without becoming contumelious!" Thus 
sage Shataananda exclaimed at the marvel occurred through Rama. [1-51-9]

Shlok 10: On hearing that sentence of his, that great-saint and sentence-precisian Sage Vishvamitra, 
replied the sentence-precisionist Sage Shataananda. [1-51-10]

Shlok 11: "I have done whatever good is to be done and nothing is left undone, and the wife 
of the sage, namely Ahalya, is reunited with her husband sage Gautama, as with Renuka 
who was reunited with sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu." So said Vishvamitra. 
[1-51-11]

[Commentary] Renuka is the mother of Parashu Rama, another human incarnation of Vishnu as a Brahmin 
to struggle with the erring Kshatriya kings of an earlier era. Renuka's husband 
is Sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu or also called as Bhaargava and on certain 
occasion, Jamadagni, orders his son Parashu Rama to behead her, i.e., Renuka, Parashu 
Rama's own mother and Parashu Rama unhesitatingly carries out his father's orders. 
Thus, Parashu Rama is called Bhaargava Rama, with an axe as his unsurpassed weapon. 
This Parashu Rama confronts Rama of Ramayana after Seetha's marriage.

Shlok 12: On hearing those words of that highly intellectual Vishvamitra, high refulgent sage 
Shataananda spoke these words to Rama. [1-51-12]

Shlok 13: Hail to thee! Oh, best one among men Rama, your arrival is a godsend, not only 
to Mithila but to entire humanity, and oh, Raghava, as an undefeatable great-sage 
Vishvamitra spearheads you, so shall your mission be undefeatable, thus hail to 
thee! [1-51-13]

[Commentary] This statement of Sage Shataananda shall remind us the utterances of Vishvamitra 
in Dasharatha's court at 1-19-14: aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam... 'I 
know this great soul Rama, the virtue valiant, even Vashishta and also these saints 
who are here...' So also, Shataananda being the son of Ahalya and Gautama perceived 
who this Rama is. Further, when such and such a sage spearheads Rama, Rama ought 
to know something about the background of his steersman, namely Vishvamitra, basing 
on which Rama can learn his own lessons. As such, next few chapters are catered 
to the legend of Vishvamitra through Shataananda.

Shlok 14: This highly resplendent Vishvamitra's exploits are unimaginable. He attained the 
highest order of Brahma-sage by his ascesis, thus illimitable is his ascetic resplendence, 
and you have to know him as an ultimate course, not only to you alone, but also 
to one and all. [1-51-14]

[Commentary] If the text 'you already know him...' is adopted there will be nothing left to Shataananda 
to say more. Hence, the meaning is said on taking vedmya 'you should know 
some more...' would be better. Because Vishvamitra is a paramahitasandhaayaka 
'a do-gooder for universal peace' as indicated by his name itself, vishva 
'of universe...' mitra 'friend, 'friend of universe...'

Shlok 15: None other than you is fortunate enough on earth, oh, Rama, as you are in the custodial 
care of Vishvamitra, the scion of Kushika, who has practised supreme ascesis. [1-51-15]

Shlok 16: What is the prowess of the great-souled Vishvamitra, and what the quintessence 
of his legend may be heard from me while I narrate it. [1-51-16]

Shlok 17: This probity-souled Vishvamitra, being a proficient in rectitude, a perfectionist 
in kingcraft, a proponent of people's welfare, more so a persecutor of enemies, 
was there as a king for a long time. [1-51-17]

Shlok 18: There was a king named Kusha, a brainchild of Prjaapati, and Kusha's son was the 
powerful and verily righteous Kushanaabha. [1-51-18]

Shlok 19: One who is highly renowned by the name Gaadhi was the son of Kushanaabha, and Gaadhi's 
son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra. [1-51-19]

Shlok 20: Vishvamitra ruled the earth, and this great-resplendent king ruled the kingdom 
for many thousands of years. [1-51-20]

Shlok 21: At one time the great-resplendent king Vishvamitra went round the earth marshalling 
a unit of akshauhini army. [1-51-21]

[Commentary] The army unit called akshauhini consists of 21,870 elephants, as many chariots, 
65,610 cavalry, and 1,09,350 foot soldiers.

Shlok 22- 23- 24- 2125- 26- 27- 28a: Moving sequentially about the provinces, cities, rivers likewise mountains, king 
Vishvamitra arrived at the threshold of a hermitage which is with numerous flowered 
trees and climbers, overspread with very many herds of animals, adored by the celestials 
like siddha-s and caarana-s, frequented and embellished with gods, demons, gandharva-s, 
and kinnara-s, spread out with equable deer, adored by flights of birds, compacted 
with the assemblages of Brahma-sages, and also with the assemblages of godly-sages 
who are fully accomplished in their ascesis, where the personal resplendence of 
each of the great-souled sage is similar to each of the Ritual-fire available in 
each of the Ritual Fire Altar before which he is sitting, and which hermitage is 
bustling with the activity of great-souled sages who are comparable to Brahma, among 
whom some subsist on water alone, and some on air alone, likewise some more on dry 
leaves, while some on fruits, tubers, and with such of those sages and also with 
particular sages like Vaalakhilyaa-s, also with others like Vaikhaanasa-s, who are 
all self-controlled, who have overcame their peccabilites, who have overpowered 
their senses that hermitage is occupied, and while everyone of the inmates is engaged 
in meditations and oblations into Ritual-fire, and with such sages and their activity 
whole of the perimeter of that hermitage is brightened and rendered splendent, and 
king Vishvamitra arrived at such a magnificent hermitage of Sage Vashishta. [1-51-22, 
23, 24, 2125, 26, 27, 28a]

Shlok 28: "And this best one among vanquishers and the great-stalwart Vishvamitra has then 
seen the hermitage of Vashishta which is like the worldly Universe of Brahma." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-51-28]



SARGA 52
------------------------------

[Text] Vashishta offers hospitality to Vishvamitra and his armies. Even though the King Vishvamitra is 
	disinclined to pressurise a hermit with such a burdensome affair of hospitality to hosts, Vashishta 
	entreats the king to accept. Vishvamitra had to oblige the same. Vashishta summons his do-all Divine 
	Sacred Cow, Shabala, also known as Kaamadhenu, requests her to generate heaps of tasteful foodstuffs 
	for a royal banquet as well as for military rations.

Shlok 1: On seeing at that best sage among best meditators Sage Vashishta, the great-mighty and valorous Vishvamitra 
is highly rejoiced and obediently made an obeisance to the sage. [1-52-1]

Shlok 2: The great-souled Vashishta spoke, "you are welcome," and that godly sage has indeed shown a high seat 
to Vishvamitra. [1-52-2]

Shlok 3: The eminent saint Vashishta then customarily offered fruits and tuber to the courageous Vishvamitra 
who by now has assumed a seat. [1-52-3]

Shlok 4: On receiving that deference from Vashishta, then that unsurpassed king Vishvamitra asked after the well-being 
of the ascesis, Fire-rituals and disciples and their progress in that hermitage, and that great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra has also asked after the well being of flora and fauna of the hermitage, and Vashishta reported 
to the matchless king about the all round well-being of every activity. [1-52-4, 5]

Shlok 6: Vashishta the supreme one among meditators, a great-ascetic, and the brainchild of Brahma has then asked 
Vishvamitra who is sitting at ease. [1-52-6]

Shlok 7: I hope that you are fine! And oh, righteous king, hope that you are ruling people righteously with 
kingly righteousness to their contentment. [1-52-7]

[Commentary] The kingly righteousness is one component among the four primary concerns of the kingcraft as said at:
nyaayena aarjanam arthasya vardhanam paalanam tathaa | satpaatre pratipattiH ca raajavR^ittam 
caturvidham ||  'monies are to be earned righteously, they are to be enriched righteously, 
and safeguarded righteously, and they are to be endowed to righteous deeds or persons, for welfare of 
the state, righteously...'

Shlok 8: I hope your servants are looked after well, hope all of them are abiding by the rulership, oh, vanquisher 
of adversaries, I hope that you have surely vanquished all of your adversaries. [1-52-8]

Shlok 9: "For you are an impeccable one and an emery-inflamer, oh, tigerly-man, I hope that your forces, exchequer 
and confederates are fine, and all is well with your sons and grandsons." Thus Vashishta asked the well-being 
of Vishvamitra. [1-52-9]

Shlok 10: The great-resplendent king Vishvamitra respectfully replied Sage Vashishta saying, 'everything 
is fine.' [1-52-10]

Shlok 11: Both of those celebrities of conscientious then exchanged pleasantries for a long time with their rejoice 
heightening and gladdening one another. [1-52-11]

Shlok 12: Then at the end of discussions, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, that godly Sage Vashishta smilingly 
spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-52-12]

Shlok 13: I wish to offer guestship befitting to your status, oh, great-forceful king Vishvamitra, to a matchless 
one like you and to this military force of yours, kindly accept it from me. [1-52-13]

Shlok 14: 'You may kindly accept all these hospitalities offered by me, oh king, for you are an important guest 
you ought to be reverenced effortfully.' So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-52-14]

[Commentary] 'It is quiet meaningless on the part of this sage, subsisting on wild fruits and tubers, to offer a 
royal banquet or rations to military and feed to horses and elephants' - is the thinking of King Vishvamitra. 
For that, the sage is saying that a king is to be reverenced 'effortfully...' But, Vishvamitra is reluctantly 
evading the so-called hospitality for 'royals' and 'armies' from a poor hermit.

Shlok 15: When sage Vashishta said in this way, that highly-intellectual king Vishvamitra said to him, 'hospitality 
is deemed to have been offered to me with your reverential words, it is enough and nothing more is necessary.' 
[1-52-15]

Shlok 16: I am entertained with whatever item that obtains in your hermitage, say fruits, tubers and water 
for feet-wash and to wet mouth. Why those petty items, I regaled just by seeing you, a godly sage like. 
Oh, highly noetic sage, by yourself you are a sage worthy to be reverenced by one and all, such as you 
are you alone have reverenced me. Now I wish to take leave, please accept my obeisance to you, and please 
look upon us with a friendlily regard. [1-52-16, 17]

[Commentary] The reverential salutation namas te astu is discussed in the endnote.

Shlok 18: Even if the king was speaking in this way obliquely to him, that virtue-souled and magnanimous sage 
Vashishta entreated the king repeatedly. [1-52-18]

Shlok 19: Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra then replied the eminent saint Vashishta, "Agreed! As it pleases the godly 
sage. So be it!" [1-52-19]

Shlok 20: When Vishvamitra said that way then Vashishta, the best one among meditators, and one whose blemishes 
are laved is gladdened, and started calling his speckled cow, namely Shabala, yclept Kaamadhenu. [1-52-20]

Shlok 21: Come on, oh, Shabala! Come quickly and listen to my words. I prepared to accord hospitality with 
a highly delectable royal banquet to this kingly sage together with all his forces. You arrange it for 
me. [1-52-21]

Shlok 22: Oh, Kaamadhenu, the Divine Cow, the Milker of All-Desires, for my sake you shower whatsoever foodstuff 
is savoured by whosoever according to one's own piquancy from each of the six savour, that too plentifully. 
[1-52-22]

[Commentary] The six tastes that shall comprise an Indian meal are: 1] caustic, 2] acidic, 3] sweetish, 4] salty, 
5] un-sweetish [bitter,] and 6] alkaline.

Shlok 23: " 'Oh, Shabala, you create heaps of savourily foodstuffs comprised of masticable items like crunchy 
foods, drinkable items like soft-drinks, tasteable items like honey-like viscous dishes, squeezable 
items like pulpy fruits, and be quick.' " So said Sage Vashishta to that Sacred Cow, Kaamadhenu, and 
Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-52-23]





[Commentary] The reverential greeting namaste is from the root nam 'bend down a little...' before 
upper echelons and the word namas is usually translated a 'salutation by bending a little...' 
and namas kaara is the act of doing so. This word namaH= na aham is 'not me...'
te astu but 'you, it shall be...' rather, 'I have lost my 'I-ness' before you as I am humbling 
myself to your high knowledge or, high seat, or elder age...' and let your 'your-ness' prevail over 
me, for I am somewhat an inferior being before you...' is the latent meaning.

[Commentary] This is either vocalised or coupled with the gesture of adjoining palms, and that mudra 'gesture...' 
is called an~jali or as a Latinian friend of ours has provided its Latin counterpart as:

[Commentary] The infinitive is iungere manus ante pectus 'to join hands in front of your chest...' or merely
iungere manus 'to join hands...' We can say iungimus manus ante pectus 'we join or 
fold our hands in front of us...' iungo manus ante pectus 'I fold my hands...' iungite 
manus ante pectus 'fold your hands in front of you...' This last sentence is the - you, plural 
- is in command form. Again, you may leave out ante pectus for succinctness.

[Commentary] And if the word iun with a half 'n' nasal is matched with Sanskrit a~n in an~jali 
and the word ngo is matched with Sanskrit ~nja as the English 'g' is most often used 
for Sanskrit 'ja' by Max Muller et al., the two an~jali of Sanskrit and iungo Latin 
have same pronunciation and portent in prayer or traditional salutation.



SARGA 53
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra tries to gain Kaamadhenu, but Sage Vashishta persistently refuses Vishvamitra's bargains 
and barters. 'When an ordinary cow alone is held sacred and it is an un-marketable commodity, how then 
can Shabala, a milker of any wish, be given away or bartered for other riches...' is the argument of 
Vashishta. Yet, Vishvamitra goes on his bidding, but in vain.

Shlok 1: "Oh, enemy-chastener Rama, when the Divine Cow Shabala is spoken in this way by Sage Vashishta, then 
that milker bestowed each and every fancy, fancied by each and every fancier, according to one's own 
fancy." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shabala or Kaamadhenu, as a part of the legend 
of Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-53-1]

Shlok 2: Shabala bestowed dishes of sugar cane and honey, and flakes of all sorts, like cornflakes, rice-flakes, 
also best arracks and liquors in best wineglasses, further, the drinks and foodstuffs that are very 
diverse and verily apposite to royalties and army-men. [1-53-2]

Shlok 3: There emerged mountainous stacks of steamy foodstuffs, palatable side-dishes and desserts of rice 
etc., also the dumplings of cooked pulses, like that the cascades of curds and the other milk products 
like butter, ghee, cheese etc. Thousands of silver dishes and hollowware fully replete with daintily 
soft drinks, like that full with sugar-candy preparations, and with preparations that comprise all the 
six tastes have come up together with delectable foodstuffs made out of treacly dumplings of cane sugar. 
[1-53-3, 4]

Shlok 5: Oh, Rama, all of the men in the forces of Vishvamitra, who are already rejoiced and regaled by the 
regular feasts accorded by their king Vishvamitra, are now comparatively well gladdened when feasted 
by Sage Vashishta, in which they rejoiced and regaled, for a good measure. [1-53-5]

Shlok 6: Partaking that feast together with the best royal ladies of palace chambers, and with the court-scholars 
and the court-priests even the king Vishvamitra, who by his nature is a kingly sage, became exultant 
and energetic. [1-53-6]

Shlok 7: When honoured along with his advisers, ministers and attendants by way of receiving a royal banquet, 
king Vishvamitra then in high admiration spoke this to Vashishta. [1-53-7]

Shlok 8: You showed me a generous hospitality whereby I am esteemed by an estimable sage like you, oh, expert 
in sententiousness, now I wish to say for myself to which you may please listen. [1-53-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: 'Oh, godly sage, this Shabala may be given to me for a barter of a lakh, a hundred thousand, cows. 
Indeed this do-all cow is a treasure, and the kings are the gatherers of treasures. Therefore bestow 
this cow to me. As rule this cow also belongs to me.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Vashishta. [1-53-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: When Vishvamitra addressed him in that way, the reverential sage Vashishta, who is a virtue-souled 
eminent saint, on his part replied the king in this way. [1-53-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: I cannot afford Shabala, neither by the barter of a hundred thousand cows, nor by hundreds of millions 
of cows, nor by lots and lots of silver, either. [1-53-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: Abandoning her from my proximity is unmeet for her, oh, enemy-subjugator, you cannot even subjugate 
me terroristically and try to wean this cow away from me, as Shabala is everlastingly and inseparably 
mine, as with the everlasting and inseparable respectability of a self-respectful person. [1-53-12b, 
13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: This cow makes the journey of my life possible. Oblations to gods or manes, enkindling of Ritual-fire, 
religious sacrifices, homa-s, the sacred rituals conducted as
darshapaurNamaasi, all are dependent on her. [1-53-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: This cow is the bedrock for everything in its entirety, and regarding diverse and numerous indoctrinations, 
and even for add-on syllabics like svaahaa, vaSaT, they are all dependent 
on this cow, there is no doubt about it. [1-53-14b 15a]

[Commentary] When the Fire-Ritual, or homa is conducted each pouring of fluid oblation or each dropping 
of solid oblation into Fire-Altar is associated with Vedic-hymns addressing the particular receiver-deity, 
annexed with syllabics like: svaahaa, svaahaakaaraaH at the end of each chant like indraaya 
svaahaa, indraaya idam na mama... varuNaaya svaahaa, varuNaaya idam na mama... 'to Indra this is 
scarified, this is for Indra, not mine... to Rain-god this is sacrificed, this is for Rain-god, not 
mine...' So also the vaSaT is annexed to the hymns addressed to manes. To learn Veda-s one 
shall be eligible to perform a Fire-ritual, and if Fire-ritual is performed, some basic Vedic hymns 
are to be learnt, and all this is a cyclic affair, requiring much paraphernalia. This cow supplies everything 
at wish, without a hassle, either to the teacher or to the taught.

Shlok 15b- 16a: "In truth, this cow is everything to me and ever-gratifier, that way by so many reasons, oh, king, 
I cannot afford Shabala to you or to anyone." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-53-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Though Vashishta spoke thus Vishvamitra being an expert in sententiousness then spoke this sentence 
compellingly and argumentatively. [1-53-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18b: I bestow upon you fourteen thousand elephants adorned with golden girdles, golden necklets and golden 
goads. [1-53-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: I will grant you eight hundred golden chariots whichever can be yoked on with four whitely-white 
horses trimmed up with the sets of tintinnabulating bells. [1-53-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b: I grant you, oh, superbly vowed sage, eleven thousand fleetly galloping horses of high pedigree born 
in best countries of best horse breeding. [1-53-19b, c]

Shlok 20: I award ten million diversely coloured and differently divisionalized cows, whichever of them will 
be came of age as milker, thereby, let this do-all cow Shabala be given to me. [1-53-20]

Shlok 21: "Or, oh, eminent Brahman, if you yearn either for gems or gold, I gift that much of everything as 
much as you can yearn, let Shabala be given to me." Thus Vishvamitra entreated again. [1-53-21]

Shlok 22: When the shrewd king Vishvamitra spoke to the reverential sage Vashishta, that sage has clearly said, 
'whatever it is oh, king, I do not surrender Shabala, the cow.' [1-53-22]

Shlok 23: Really this alone is my gemmy cow, thus I do not require your jewels or gems... truly, this alone 
is my treasure, thus I do not require your gilded chariots, horses or elephants... really, this alone 
is my everything, thus I need nothing from you... and actually, this alone is my alter-ego, thus you 
cannot separate me from myself. [1-53-23]

Shlok 24: This alone is my darsha-puurNamaasa rituals, and like that this alone 
is all my Vedic-rituals with worthwhile donations and oh, king, this essentially is of service in diverse 
activities of mine. [1-53-24]

Shlok 25: " Oh, king, all of my activities are instated in this cow, then wherefore a lot of palavering a bargain 
or barter? I do not give away this milker any wish." So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra, and thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of the legend of Sacred Cow. [1-53-25]

[Commentary] If cow is held sacred in India it is held precious all over the world. Whatever is given by a cow, from 
its milk to cow-dung, it is put to use, even for medicinal purposes, which is evident from insulin and 
smallpox vaccines. Regarding go mahaatmyam 'sacredness of cow' Bheeshma speaks at length about 
the sacredness of cow to Yudhishtar, in Anushaasanika Parva of Maha Bharata.

[Commentary] Here, on hinting in an indirect way about go maahaatmyam 'the sacredness of the cow...' and 
its un-marketability, Sage Vashishta paused his negation, hoping that Vishvamitra will realise, as he 
is also well-versed in scriptures.



SARGA 54
------------------------------

[Text] The seizure of Kaamadhenu, the Sacred Cow, causes anxiety in her and she urges Vashishta 
to counteract the atrocity of Vishvamitra. Agreeing to her, the sage asks the Cow 
to create a force that can subdue the forces of Vishvamitra. Accordingly, that Cow 
generates newer forces and a war ensues.

Shlok 1: "When Sage Vashishta did not yield Kaamadhenu, the milker of any desire, oh, Rama, 
then Vishvamitra started to seize it." Sage Shataananda continued the narration 
of the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-54-1]

Shlok 2: While the determined king Vishvamitra dragged her away from Vashishta, oh, Rama, 
Shabala is saddened and tearfully mulled over stung by the anguish of her secession 
from the sage. [1-54-2]

Shlok 3: A pitiable and highly anguished one, such as I am. I am being dragged away by 
the servants of the king. Has this great souled Sage Vashishta abandoned me, or 
what? [1-54-3]

Shlok 4: 'Or, did I do any misdeed towards that great sage of sacred soul whereby he is 
leaving me off. I have always been reverent and a cherished cow to that priest 
and am I no errant.' That cow eulogised in this manner. [1-54-4]

Shlok 5: On thinking thus and suspiring repeatedly, oh, enemy-subjugator, Rama, then she 
that Sacred Cow hastily rushed with the speed a gust and went to that highly energetic 
Vashishta on utterly shoving off hundreds of attendants of the king who are roping 
her, and then she straight went to the base of the feet of the great-souled Vashishta. 
[1-54-5, 6]

Shlok 7: She that moaning and groaning Shabala staying before the Sage Vashishta spoke this 
bellowing like a thunderous cloud. [1-54-7]

Shlok 8: 'Oh, Son of Brahma, why I am discarded by you, whereby oh, god, the king's attendants 
are weaning me away from your proximity.' So Shabala urged Vashishta. [1-54-8]

Shlok 9: When he is spoken thus, then that Brahma-sage spoke this sentence to worrisome 
Shabala, whose heart is worrying with worry, as he would speak with his own sister 
in her worriment. [1-54-9]

Shlok 10: Neither I forswear you nor you fouled me, oh, Shabala, this king is forcibly 
weaning you away from me as he is beside himself with kingly arrogance. [1-54-10]

Shlok 11: 'My ability is not balanceable with his, isn't it. Above all, on his part he is 
a king now, and a king will be mighty, he is the lord of the land and a Kshatriya, 
and thus we have to be subservient to a Kshatriya, isn't it. [1-54-11]

Shlok 12: 'This akShauhiNi unit of army is plethoric, overcrowded 
with elephants, horses, and chariots, and overspread with flags and elephants, thereby 
he is mightier than me.' Thus Vashishta tried to pacify that Sacred-Cow. [1-54-12]

Shlok 13: She who is spoken that way by Vashishta, that sententious Sacred Cow, Shabala, 
in her turn obediently spoke this sentence to that Brahma-sage of un-balanceable 
resplendence. [1-54-13]

Shlok 14: 'Oh, Brahman, unstated is that the might of sovereignty as mightier than the might 
of sagacity. A sage is mightier than a sovereign. A sage's might is mightiest than 
the mightier sovereign, for a sage's might is angelic.' So Shabala started talking 
to the sage. [1-54-14]

[Commentary] This is the relevant stanza for the later time debates or essay competitions under 
the caption of 'pen vs. sword... which is mightier...' Here, though Vishvamitra 
is well aware that a sage's possession cannot be usurped, he resorted to the same. 
The Sacred Cow is telling the above with intolerance towards Vishvamitra's violation 
of the norms. saa api asahamaanaa kaamadohinii shaantyaa kShamayaa yuktam vashiShTam avocat 
-

[Commentary] What a king has got to do with a sage's wealth? A sage acquires it with his ascesis 
and it is not another king's kingdom to conquer.

- dk The scriptures, norms, ethics demand that a sagacious person 
shall not be robbed off his possession, which he acquires by his personal merit. 
But Vishvamitra's brain tilted this way because of his all-conquering avarice and 
he thought that this cow is also conquerable, and gods give such a mind only to 
see the greedy to fail and thus insulted of their might.

[Commentary] na tveva kadaacit svayam raajaa brahmaNasvaadadiita - bodhaayana suutra - atha

possession is not to be snatched away - bodhaayana suutraa-s; 'a poison 
if consumed kills one that consumes it... but the possession of a sagacious person, 
if tried for consumption, it consumes whole lot of the consumer's sons, grandsons 
and his clan itself, besides the consumer...for sage's possession in itself is a 
lethal poison...'

Shlok 15: Immutable is your power as you are mightier than great-mighty Vishvamitra and 
invincible is your dynamism. [1-54-15]

Shlok 16: 'Ordain me, oh, highly resplendent sage, who am replete with the power of your 
sagacity, and I will disprove the vanity, valour, and venture of that injudicious 
king for this injudicious seizure.' Thus Shabala implored the sage Vashishta. [1-54-16]

Shlok 17: Oh, Rama, when spoken by her thus, that highly glorious Vashishta said to Shabala, 
the do-all cow, 'create a power that can overpower the power of opponent.' Vashishta 
said so to Shabala.[1-54-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: On hearing his sentence, oh, Rama, that Sacred Cow Shabala then created Pahlava 
kings, sprang forth from her mooing 'hums', and hundreds of them annihilated the 
army of Vishvamitra in its entirety just while Vishvamitra is witnessing it. [1-54-18, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: King Vishvamitra was utterly infuriated and with wide-eyed anger he started to 
destroy those Pahlava-s with many a kind of his weaponry. [1-54-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: On seeing the subdual of hundreds of Pahlava-s by Vishvamitra, then the Sacred 
Cow again generated deadly Shaka-s hobnobbed with Yavana-s through her mooing 'hums'. 
[1-54-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] These Shaka-s and Yavana-s are the Shakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians 
of Max Muller. Some discussion about this is included in the endnote of Kishkindha, 
Ch. 43. Dharmaakuutam says: tadanu vashiShThaabhyanuj~naataa shabalaa nirmitapahlavaadi - nikR^iShTajaati 
- niShuuditam svam balam vishvaamitra - iti - dk These are viewed 
as deadly, lowly, ruffian class of warriors in Indian viewpoint and created out 
of thin air by this Sacred Cow.

Shlok 21b- 22a: Then the earth was pervaded with the Shaka-s associated with Yavana-s, who have 
effectuation and bravery in overcoming their enemy forces, and who are golden in 
bodily colour similar to the golden pistils of flowers which complexion is outlandish. 
[1-54- 21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b: Yavana-s and Shaka-s, who are wielding bowie knives and broad lances and who are 
clad in golden coloured dresses, and who looked like glowing fires have completely 
burnt down entire force of Vishvamitra. [1-54-22, 23a]

Shlok 23: "Then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra indeed released his missiles, by which 
Yavana-s, Kaambhoja-s, and the Barbara-s, are rendered helter-skelter." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra. [1-54-23b,c.]

[Commentary] The Barbara-s are said in this text whereas other mms contain it as "Pahlava-s'. 
Even on taking Barbara-s, they are an outlandish clan and the word 'Barbara' might 
have been the ancestor word of the present day 'Barbarian.'



SARGA 55
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra ruins Vashishta's hermitage on acquiring missiles at the grace of God Shiva by practising 
a paramount ascesis. When the forces generated by Wish-Milker Sacred Cow, namely Kaamadhenu, have eliminated 
Vishvamitra's army and his hundred sons, he felt indignant and pray Shiva for bestowal of unusual missiles. 
On getting them, he again comes to Sage Vashishta's hermitage and ruins it completely. Then extremely 
infuriated Sage Vashishta resorts to his Brahma-baton to confront Vishvamitra.

Shlok 1: Then on seeing the flurrying warriors earlier created by the Sacred Cow, Shabala, who are perplexed 
by the missiles of Vishvamitra, Vashishta started to motivate her, 'oh, wish-milker, generate more forces 
by your yogic capacity.' Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra 
to Rama. [1-55-1]

Shlok 2- 3: "From the 'hums' of her mooing Kaamboja-s similar to sunshine are born, from her udder Pahlava-s wielding 
weaponry are born, from the area of her privates Yavana-s, likewise from her rectal area Shaka-s, and 
from her hair-roots Mleccha-s, Haariitaa-s along with Kirataka-s are issued forth. [1-55-2, 3]

Shlok 4: At that very moment, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, Vishvamitra's army comprising foot-soldiers, elephants, 
chariots and horses is utterly slaughtered by the Yavana, Mleccha etc., forces generated by the Sacred 
Cow. [1-55-4]

Shlok 5: On seeing their army utterly slaughtered by the vital spirit of Vashishta, a band of hundred sons of 
Vishvamitra wielding divers weapons exasperatedly sprinted forth towards that supreme meditator among 
all meditators. But that great sage Vashishta completely burnt all of them down just by blasting 'hum' 
sounds. [1-55-5, 6]

Shlok 7: That sage with vital spirit, Vashishta, then in a wink rendered those sons of Vishvamitra, along with 
their horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers to ashes. [1-55-7]

Shlok 8: On seeing his sons and his forces are utterly ruined, that very highly glorious Vishvamitra was disgraced 
and beset by distress. [1-55-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: Like a tideless ocean his warfare did not tide him over, like a fangless serpent his hiss of warring 
could not fang any, like a wingless bird pitiable is his flightless plight of fightback, like a shineless 
sun in an eclipse, Vishvamitra plunged into a lustreless state of his own illustriousness, when his 
forces are ruined along with his sons. [1-55-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11: When all his intrepidity and impetuosity are ruined an indolence bechanced upon him, and then on bidding 
one son for the kingdom, 'you rule the earth with the duties of kingcraft...' thus saying Vishvamitra 
took recourse to forests. [1-55-10b, 11]

Shlok 12: On going to the mountainsides of Himalayas, whereat it is adored by kinnaraa-s and uragaa-s, the nymphs 
and nymphean serpents, he that great practiser of ascesis, Vishvamitra, undertook an austere ascesis 
for the sake of beneficence of the Great God, Shiva. [1-55-12]

Shlok 13: After a long lost time, Shiva, the God of Gods whose flag bears the sign of Holy Bull, has shown himself 
to that great-saint Vishvamitra, for He is a ready boon-giver. [1-55-13]

Shlok 14: 'Oh, king, for which purpose you undertook this ascesis that you may tell me. What is it really intended 
by you and what boon you seek that be made known to me for I am the boon-giver.' Shiva said so to Vishvamitra. 
[1-55-14]

Shlok 15: Thus said by God Shiva to Vishvamitra of great ascesis, Vishvamitra on reverencing that Great God Shiva 
said this way. [1-55-15]

Shlok 16: Oh! Mahadeva, the Impeccable Great God... providing that you are gladdened by my ascetic devotion,
dhanurveda, the Holy Writ of Archery, with its complemental and supplemental 
Writs, and along with its summational Upanishad-s, together with its preternatural 
doctrines... they may kindly be bestowed upon me... [1-55-16]

Shlok 17- 18a: ' Oh, Exquisite God, whichever missile is there either with gods, or fiends, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, 
and demons, let it dawn upon me. For you alone are the God of Gods your blessings alone can fulfil my 
aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra entreated God Shiva. [1-55-17, 18a]

Shlok 18b: 'So be it!' On sanctifying Vishvamitra and his aspiration thus, the God of Gods, Shiva disappeared. 
[1-55-18b]

Shlok 19: Vishvamitra who is already a mightier Kshatriya, now on acquiring missiles from the God of Gods, Shiva, 
will he not come forth paired up with mightiest conceit, and then will not his conceitedness be plethoric 
like a plethoric ocean? [1-55-19]

Shlok 20: By vitality Vishvamitra is like an ocean with rough riptide on a Full Moon day, and oh, Rama, he deemed 
that sagaciously mighty sage Vashishta is now 'dead.' [1-55-20]

Shlok 21: Then on going to the threshold of Vashishta 's hermitage that king propelled his missiles, by the holocaust 
of which missiles that ascetic woodland is completely burnt down in its entirety. [1-55-21]

Shlok 22: On seeing the turbo-jetting missiles of Vishvamitra jetted by his sparkling intellect, hundreds of 
saints were frightened and they very speedily fled in hundreds of ways. [1-55-22]

Shlok 23: Whoever is the disciple of Vashishta and whichever is either animal or a bird, all are utterly frightened 
and thousands of them have hastily fled to numerous directions. [1-55-23]

Shlok 24: The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta's hermitage fell void, and in a wink it has become silent 
like a burial ground as every shrub, herb and tree is cindery, and every bird, animal and stock is an 
evacuee. [1-55-24]

Shlok 25: Although Vashishta shouted at them saying time and again, 'do not fear, do not fear... now I will dissipate 
that son of Gaadhi, Vishvamitra, like Sun demisting the mist,' all the inmates of hermitage have hastily 
fled. [1-55-25]

Shlok 26: On saying that way to the evacuees, Vashishta, the great-resplendent sage and a best one among best 
meditators rancorously said this word to Vishvamitra. [1-55-26]

Shlok 27: You senseless king, by which reason you have havocked this hermitage that is well nourished for a 
long time by me, for that reason you have become a reprehensible one, and thereby you will not survive 
any longer. [1-55-27]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'when I have sensibly nourished the trees, birds and animals or disciples, saints and sages, 
in indoctrinating them the true dharma 'righteous duty...' observable by each of the birthed 
being, what necessitated you to harm the harmless 'fly anywhere' birds, 'new to world' calves and 'take 
what you need' trees and animals... you should have confronted me headlong, instead... but you on seeing 
such a beatitude of this hermitage, you have become envious in your self-aggrandisement... and as said 
in an old saying like, 'a senseless reprehensible being, may it be a human, animal, bird, or a reptile 
is unfit to survive for long...' you are now transposable with such a senseless being by this act of 
yours, which you have undertaken with the notion of 'survival of the fittest...' thereby I will now 
show you who is fit enough to survive, an instructor or an intruder, in effacing your survival...'

Shlok 28: "On saying thus that extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta post-hastily up-heaved his baton, which is 
alike the fumeless Ultimate Fire of End Time, and the other baton of Yama, the Terminator, and affronted 
Vishvamitra." Thus, Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-55-28]



SARGA 56
------------------------------

[Text] Vashishta nullifies Vishvamitra's missiles just by his Brahma's baton. All missiles 
are defused when Vashishta consumed them. Vishvamitra launches the highest missile, 
namely Brahma-missile, which too is consumed by Vashishta, whereby the body of Vashishta 
becomes a Brahma missile and starts to emit radiation. Then, upon the prayer of 
gods and saints, Vashishta withdraws the effect of that missile. Vishvamitra on 
seeing this concludes that mere missiles are of no use and thus he embarks on a 
sublime ascesis for Brahma-hood.

Shlok 1: When Vashishta spoke in this way, the great-mighty Vishvamitra brandishing Fiery-missile 
challenged Vashishta saying, "withstand this, withstand this..." Thus, sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-56-1]

Shlok 2: That reverential sage Vashishta then upraising his Brahma-baton, which is like 
the other baton of the Terminator, spoke this sentence furiously. [1-56-2]

Shlok 3: I am staying here only, you meritless Kshatriya, you may clearly display whatever 
prowess you have, oh, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra, I will now ruin whatever vanity 
you or your missiles have. [1-56-3]

Shlok 4: "Where stands the force of belligerence when compared to the supreme force of 
sagacity, you abased Kshatriya, watch out for my strength of seraphic sagacity." 
So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-56-4]

Shlok 5: With his baton of Brahma Vashishta silenced that matchless and deadly Fiery-missile 
of Gaadhi's son, namely Vishvamitra, as a deluge of water silencing a rage of fire. 
[1-56-5]

Shlok 6: Vishvamitra, the son of Gaadhi then rancorously fusilladed the missiles regulated 
by gods like Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Paashupata, and even a missile which is projectile 
through grass blade called Ishiika. [1-56-6]

[Commentary] The accounts of these missiles are narrated in chapters 27, 28 of this canto Bala, 
where Vishvamitra accords these very missiles to Rama. Hence, their details are 
not reiterated here but just catalogued.

Shlok 7: Vishvamitra also launched missiles named Humane, Rager, Stupefier, Hypnotiser, 
Yawner, Intoxicator, also thus Humidifier, Weep-inducer. [1-56-7]

Shlok 8: He also launched the missiles called Drainer and Ripper, and the highly unconquerable 
Thunderbolt, even the lassos of Brahma, Time and Rain-gods. [1-56-8]

Shlok 9: Also missiles called Shiva, Monster, Punisher, Wrester and like that the Baffler, 
Bolter, Drier, Drencher are launched. [1-56-9]

Shlok 10: And he launched discs called the Discs of Virtue, Time and Vishnu and he also launched 
other missiles like the Blower, Stirrer and like that the missile with Horse-head. 
[1-56-10]

Shlok 11: A pair of powers are launched, namely Power of Vishnu and the Power of Rudra, like 
that the Impeller, Crowbar, and a great missile called Staggerer, and then he launched 
the lethal missile of the Time. [1-56-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, Vishvamitra on triggering off all these missiles 
then he launched the deadly Trident, Skull and Torque missiles on Vashishta, and 
whole thing has became a spectacular display of Vishvamitra's arsenal. [1-56-12, 
13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Brahma's son Vashishta defused all of those missiles just with his baton and when 
all of them are thus silenced, Gaadhi's son Vishvamitra touched off Brahma's missile. 
[1-56-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: When Vishvamitra brandished and set up Brahma missile for launching, seeing it 
all the gods keeping the Fire-god at their vanguard, godly sages, reptiles along 
with gandharva-s are perplexed, and the triad of worlds itself is perturbed. [1-56-14b, 
15]

Shlok 16: Even that deleteriously destructive Brahma's missile is completely consumed with 
the seraphic resplendence of Brahma-baton of Sage Vashishta. [1-56-16]

Shlok 17: The appearance of that great-souled Vashishta became appallingly perplexing when 
he is finishing off that Brahma missile as if to surely petrify the Tri-world. [1-56-17]

Shlok 18: From all of the pits of hair of that great-souled Vashishta ramified are the raditional 
beams and those radiated shafts are rolling up with the fumes of radiation, so to 
speak. [1-56-18]

Shlok 19: The baton of Brahma gripped in his hand and upraised by Vashishta is highly glowing 
as if it is the fumeless inferno of Time, and as if it is the earthly baton of Yama, 
the Terminator. [1-56-19]

Shlok 20-21: 'The assemblages of saints then extolled the best meditator Vashishta saying, 'oh, 
Brahman, infallible is your prowess, but bear this combustion of missile by your 
own combustive power. Though Vishvamitra is a supreme ascetic he is forestalled 
by you and your seraphic power, but this power of yours is equally anguishing all 
the worlds. Hence, let the worlds survive shooing away their anguish caused by your 
prowess. Oh, Brahman, be gracious, for you are the best among the best meditators...' 
So said saints to Vashishta. [1-56-20, 21]

Shlok 22: When that great-resplendent Vashishta is spoken thus by saints and gods he composed 
himself, and then that estranged Vishvamitra spoke this to himself with heavy suspiration. 
[1-56-22]

Shlok 23: Fie upon the might of Kshatriya, mightier is the might of Brahman's resplendence, 
only with one baton of Brahma all of my missiles are defused. [1-56-23]

Shlok 24: " 'Therefore on analysing this matter, I with my heart and senses quietened will 
embark on a sublime ascesis which really will be the causative factor for according 
Brahma-Sage-hood.' So thought Vishvamitra..." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-56-24]

[Commentary] Firstly the difference between a
Brahmin and a Brahman 
may be differentiated, where a Brahmin is just by his birth in that caste and if 
he practises numerous ordeals he will attain Brahman-hood. Not all Brahmins are 
Brahmans and a real Brahman will not look back for his birth details.

[Commentary] Throughout 
this chapter Vashishta is called by Valmiki as japataam varaH, 
japataam shreSTaH and the like, only to remind us that Vashishta is an eminent 
meditator of Vedic hymns, all of which culminate into Gayatri hymn. Thus, Vashishta's 
only weapon is Gayatri hymn with which he subjugated all the arsenal of Vishvamitra. 
The fight between Vishvamitra and Vashishta is not just a fight between a sage and 
king, but between vidya - avidya; aatmavidya - anaatmavidya 
'enlightenment and un-enlightenment...' An enlightened one does not spring up at 
any trivial inconvenience but becomes a horrid being, if that antagonistic assail 
becomes intolerable for living beings. This is the real essence and nature of a 
true Brahman, whose arsenal is just a wooden baton 
and heartfelt Gayatri hymn.

[Commentary] For this Bhagavad Gita says at Ch. 18, verse 
42:

[Commentary] 'A Brahman's virtues, / Prince 
Born of his nature, are serenity / Self-mastery, religion, purity / Patience, uprightness, 
learning, and to know / The truth of things which be...' Sir Edwin Arnold.

[Commentary] Thus, 
Vashishta had never resorted to meaningless curses, menacing arsenal, mutinous retaliation 
but just swallowed the wrath of a wrathful king. This is brahmaNatva



SARGA 57
------------------------------

[Text] The legend of Trishanku is narrated to Rama, which forms a part of Vishvamitra's 
			legend. When Brahma blesses Vishvamitra to be a kingly-saint, rather 
			than a Brahman-saint, Vishvamitra continues his ascesis in southerly 
			parts of country. In the meantime, one king named Trishanku desired 
			to go to heaven with mortal body and approaches Vashishta who rejects 
			that very suggestion. Then that king approaches the sons of the same 
			Vashishta with the same idea.

Shlok 1- 2- 3a: "Oh, Raghava, on making that great-souled Vashishta an enemy, whenever Vishvamitra 
reminisced over his subdual by Vashishta, he is seethed at heart and heaved sighs 
repeatedly. Then on going to southern quarter with his prime queen, that great-ascetic 
Vishvamitra self-collectedly conducted a highly astounding ascesis subsisting only 
on fruits and tubers." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra's 
legend. [1-57-1, 2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: Then Vishvamitra begot sons named Havispanda, Madhuspnada, Dhridhanetra and Mahaaratha, 
who conduct themselves in candour and chivalry. [1-57-3]

Shlok 4b- 5: At the close of one thousand years of ascesis Brahma, the Grandparent of all worlds, 
revealed Himself to Vishvamitra and spoke these words mellowly to ascetically wealthy 
Vishvamitra, 'oh, son of Kushika, Vishvamitra, you have won the worlds of kingly-sages 
by your ascesis.' [1-57-4b, 5]

Shlok 6- 7a: 'We indeed acquiesce you as a kingly-sage by your ascesis.' saying so that great 
resplendent Brahma, the Supreme Ruler of the Worlds, went away to his Abode of Brahma, 
while the gods in Brahma's convoy went to Indra's Heaven. [1-57-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: On hearing that Vishvamitra is down-faced with disgrace, and while high anguish 
prevailed over him, he rancorously soliloquised this. [1-57-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: 'Even though I have practised a very high ascesis, the gods together with the 
observances of hermits are recognising me just as a 'kingly-sage.' Thereby I deem 
that there is no fruition to my ascesis.' Thus Vishvamitra thought. [8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, deciding in this way in his heart of hearts that self-willed 
Vishvamitra again undertook a supreme ascesis as he is a great-ascetic. [1-57-9]

Shlok 10b- 11a: In this meantime there is a veracious king named Trishanku, an enhancer of 
Ikshvaku dynasty, and one renowned for his self-conquest. [1-57-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: Oh, Raghava, an idea sprang up in the mind of Trishanku to perform a ritual 
by which he will go to heaven with his own body. Then he sincerely invited Vashishta 
and told him what his thinking is. [1-57-11b, 12]

Shlok 13- 14a: But the great-souled Vashishta said it as impossible. Thus repudiated Trishanku 
went to southerly direction in search of orchestrators for the purpose of realising 
that task, such a phantasmal ritual that enables him to go to heaven with his body, 
and that king has gone to the sons of Vashishta. [1-57-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15: Trishanku has indeed gone to the place where the sons of Vashishta are protractedly 
expiating, and there he visited the hundred noble-souled sons of Vashishta, who 
are supremely self-luminescent and superbly self-refulgent by their ascesis. [1-57-14b, 
15]

Shlok 16- 17a: On reaching nigh of those noble-souled sons of the indoctrinator, namely Vashishta, 
Trishanku reverenced all of them sequentially according to their age, but with a 
little down- faced owing to abashment, and spoke to all of those great-souled ones 
making palm-fold in supplication. [1-57-16]

Shlok 17b- 18a: I have come as a shelter-seeker seeking the shelter of yours as you are the shelterers 
of the needy, you all be safe, as the great-souled Vashishta has repudiated me. 
[1-57-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19: I am longing to perform an unusual ritual and it will be apt of you to give assent 
to it. Reverencing all of the sons of my mentor Vashishta I am proposing this to 
you. [1-57-18b, 19]

Shlok 19b- 20: With reverence I truckle before you all Brahmans who are abiding in ascesis. 
Such as you are I beg you to assiduously get a ritual performed through me, as to 
how I can get to heaven with my body. [1-57-19b, 20]

Shlok 21: Oh, ascetically wealthy Brahmans, as I am repudiated by Vashishta, I do not perceive 
another recourse excepting you, who are all the sons of mentor Vashishta. [1-57-21]

Shlok 22: " 'The Priest is the ultimate recourse for all of the kings in Ikshvaku dynasty, 
isn't it. Therefore, next to Vashishta you are all the next-best gods to me.' Thus 
Trishanku entreated the hundred sons of Sage Vashishta." Sage Shataananda thus continued 
narration. [1-57-22]



SARGA 58
------------------------------

[Text] Trishanku seeks shelter of Vishvamitra when the sons of Vashishta rebuffed him, and even cursed him 
to become a profaner. Narrating his sad tale and his idealistic idea of going to heaven with mortal 
body, Trishanku earnestly appeals to Vishvamitra.

Shlok 1: "On hearing the sentence of Trishanku, oh, Rama, the hundred sons of sage Vashishta infuriately said 
this to that king." Thus, sage Shataananda continued his narration to Rama and others. [1-58-1]

Shlok 2: 'You slow-witted king, your veracious mentor has denounced you. But transgressing him how do you approach 
another branch of the same tree of wisdom, when that very tree rejected you?' So the sons of Vashishta 
have started to denounce Trishanku. [1-58-2]

Shlok 3: 'The Royal Priest is the ultimate course for all of Ikshvaku-s, isn't it. It is impossible to transgress 
the word of advise of such a veracious Priest. [1-58-3]

Shlok 4: Vashishta is the most reverential sage and such a sage has already said it is impossible to conduct 
such a Vedic-ritual. Then, in which way we are capable to conduct such a Vedic-ritual? [1-58-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: 'Oh king of subjects, better get back to your own city again for you are childish. That godlike Vashishta 
alone is capable to orchestrate any ritual by any king in all the three worlds. Oh, king, how then we 
are capable to cause a disrepute to his reputation.' Thus, the sons of Vashishta refuted Trishanku. 
[1-58-5, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: "On hearing that sentence of theirs which is highly faltering with words of fury that king further spoke 
this sentence to all of them." So Shataananda continued. [1-58-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8a: 'I am indeed rejected by the godlike Vashishta, likewise even by you, the sons of the same mentor, 
as such oh, ascetically wealthy scholars, in this state obloquy I will resort to another recourse, let 
safety betide you.' So Trishanku bade farewell to the sons of Vashishta, but... [1-58-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: But the sons of the sage Vashishta, on hearing that sentence of the king, that is inclusive of and 
leading to a calamitous situation, have become very highly infuriated and cursed saying, 'you shall 
get into a state of basely profaner.' That is the curse issued by the sons of Vashishta to Trishanku. 
[1-58-8b, 9a]

[Commentary] This expression caNDaal has its own impact. The nomenclature of caNDaal is not the 
present day 'untouchable' 'outcaste' or a 'pariah' etc., because he is also a member and an important 
functionary in Hindu system of castes. In Aranya Kanda Seetha admonishes Ravana with the same wording 
at 3-56-18. The analogy she uses there is to differentiate between functionaries like the Vedic-scholar 
and the caste-bound Profaner [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious rites or any esoteric 
knowledge... but socially designated as a Cremator] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, 
and between the Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar, or a true 
Brahmin may perhaps conduct a yaj~na but he is no authority to conduct antyakriya 
'funerals' till its end. At best, a priest's function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps 
until kapaalamoksha 'breakage of cranium...' and from then on it is the function of this
caNDaal to take care of the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since 
leaving half burnt corpse to vultures and wolves is sinning as well as for unsanitary situations. Thus, 
if a Vedic scholar conducts jaataadi kriyaaH 'rites from birth onwards...' as an initiator, 
then a caNDaal conducts antya, uttarakriyaaH 'rites of death afterwards...' as a 
terminator. This verbiage is to demark the relative values of functionaries, according to the maxim 
'a donkey is to bear and a dog is to bark...' and if their functions are reversed, reversed are our 
results.

Shlok 9b- 10a: On saying thus those great-souled sons of Vashishta withdrew to one's own hermitage and when that night 
elapsed into day then the king lapsed into a state of basely profaner. [1-58-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: He is now wearing blackish cloths which on yestereve were ochry silks, he is now a blackamoor who on 
yestereve was a gilt-royalty, his head-hair is shaggy which earlier was silkily soft, and his royal 
garlands which were richly fragrant are now funeral wreaths, and he is besmeared with crematory ashes 
which were regal emollients, and his royal jewellery is now rendered into iron adornments. [1-58-10b, 
11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On seeing him in the mien of a profaner, oh, Rama, all of his ministers and the subjects and his own 
retinue have deserted him and took to flight in masses. [1-58-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: Though that resolutely self-assured king seethed for one night and day for this mishap, then went to 
the ascetically prosperous Vishvamitra. [1-58-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: But on seeing at that mien of the king which is rendered to that of a precluded profaner from kingship 
and for officiating rituals etc., oh, Rama, sage Vishvamitra because sympathetic. [1-58-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] The preclusion of the king by way of his transfiguring into a profaner is not only from his kingship, 
by which he is debarred from officiating Vedic rituals etc., but also from his aihika-aamuSmika- 
bhogaaH 'earthly and heavenly enjoyments...' because a king is a godsend being.

Shlok 14b- 15a: The great-resplendent sage and highly generous Vishvamitra firstly said to that king who is in a terrible 
aspect 'let safety betide you,' and then spoke on this sentence to him. [1-58-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: 'What is the purpose of your visit, oh, great-mighty prince Trishanku, oh, brave lord of Ayodhya, 
you are accurst to the state of profaner.' [1-58-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then that king who is accurst to a state of profaner on listening that sentence, as a diligent sentence 
maker spoke this sentence with his palms adjoined to the sententious sage Vishvamitra. [1-58-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: I am spurned off by my mentor Vashishta and also like that by his sons. My aspiration remained unachievable, 
besides, this discrepancy has bechanced upon me. [1-58-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: 'Oh, gentle Vishvamitra, my aspiration is nothing but to go to heaven with my body. I have performed 
hundred rituals but I have not achieved the fruit.' Thus Trishanku started tell his sad tale.

Shlok 19b- 20a: And now if you doubt me to be a liar, I am no liar either. I spoke no lie heretofore, and even if 
I were to land into any predicament I do not speak lies anytime hereinafter. Oh, gentle sage, this I 
pledge you upon my virtue of Kshatriya-hood. [1-58-19, 20a]

[Commentary] A liar is hell-bound but not the other way as said yaj~no anR^ite na rakshati... 'a Vedic ritual 
would not save liars...'

Shlok 20b- 21a: I have propitiated gods with many kinds of Vedic-rituals. I have reigned over people conscientiously. 
And with my conduct and comport the high-souled savants are also pleased. [1-58-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: While I am a pursuant in probity I expect to avail myself of the fruition of this kind of Vedic-ritual. 
Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, but my mentors are not deriving complete contentment by my pursuit. Hence, 
they shove me off. [1-58-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: I deem destiny is the only ultimate, and manly efforts are meaningless, for destiny surmounts everything. 
Destiny is the ultimate course, isn't it? [1-58-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b: A highly anguished endeavourer, marred by destiny, a sincere requester, such as I am, it will be 
apt of you to accord, you be safe, your favour upon me. [1-58-23b, c]

Shlok 24: " 'In no alternate course I wish to course through and no alternative shelter is there for me. Hence, 
it will be apt of you, a god in man's mien, to countervail my destiny.' Thus Trishanku prayed for the 
grace of Vishvamitra..." So said Sage Shataananda to Rama and others continuing the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-58-24]



SARGA 59
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra undertakes Trishanku's Vedic ritual and sends disciples to invite all Vedic-scholars. Many 
sages have come except for Vashishta and his sons. Further, the sons of Vashishta have ridiculed this 
ritual of Vishvamitra and Trishanku. Vishvamitra gets irritated and hurls curses at the sons of Vashishta.

Shlok 1: "Vishvamitra, the son of Kushi, piteously spoke this mellowly sentence to king Trishanku who spoke thus, 
and who in reality attained a state of profaner." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-59-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s, you are welcome. I am aware that you are a highly righteous 
king. Oh, the best king, you need not be dismayed, for I accord you haven. [1-59-2]

Shlok 3: I will invite all the sages with pious activities who will render assistance in the ritual, oh, king, 
then you can perform the ritual self-composedly. [1-59-3]

Shlok 4: You can go to heaven with this body of yours, as well as with the form which is deformed by the curse 
of mentor Vashishta through his sons. [1-59-4]

Shlok 5: 'I deem that heaven is handy to you, oh, king of subjects, as you have approached the all-sheltering 
Vishvamitra and sought shelter.' Thus Vishvamitra solaced Trishanku. [1-59-5]

Shlok 6: On saying thus to Trishanku that great-resplendent Vishvamitra ordered his highly righteous and astutely 
brilliant sons to organise the arrangements for the ritual. [1-59-6]

Shlok 7- 8a: Vishvamitra calling forth all of his disciples said this sentence, 'oh boys invite all the eminent sages who 
are well-read in many Veda-s, along with their disciples and friends, and their ritwiks, the conductors 
of rituals at my order.' [1-59-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: 'If someone speaks inconsiderately incited by the forcefulness of my word, whoever speaks it, whichever 
word it may be, all that is to be reported to me, whatever it is.' Thus Vishvamitra ordered his disciples. 
[1-59-8]

Shlok 9b- 10a: On listening that word of Vishvamitra his disciples went to all directions inviting all by his order, 
and then the Vedic scholars started to arrive from all provinces. [1-59-9 b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: All of the disciples have returned to the fulgently resplendent sage Vishvamitra, and reported the 
words spoken by all the Vedic scholars. [1-59-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: 'On listening your word all the Brahmans from all provinces have started to come and some have already 
come, leaving alone Mahodaya, the son of Vashishta.' Thus, the disciples have started to inform Vishvamitra. 
[1-59-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: What all said by those hundred sons of Vashishta is explosively worded in their fury, oh, eminent 
sage, and what all they have said that you may please listen. [1-59-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: 'A Kshatriya is the officiator, and a profaner is the performer. How then the gods or sages can partake 
of the remnants of oblations in that ritual-assembly, especially that of a profaner?' Thus, the sons 
of Vashishta exclaimed. [1-59-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] One who is uninitiated into any esoteric knowledge is venturing to perform a Vedic ritual and a king, 
who can perform a ritual, but who cannot officiate ritual or teach Veda-s like a Brahman, is officiating 
it. Thus both of these, officiator and performer have no Vedic sanctity.

Shlok 14b- 15a: Though the Brahmans or the high-souled sages are now embarrassed by Vishvamitra, how can they go 
to heaven even after their demise, partaking of the food of a profaner? [1-59-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: 'Oh, tigerly sage Vishvamitra, all the sons of Vashishta including Mahodaya spoke these derisive sentences 
with their eyes reddening in anger.' Thus, the disciples reported to Vishvamitra. [1-59-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: The eminent sage Vishvamitra having heard those words of the sons of Vashishta from all of his disciples, 
said this rancorously with bloodshot eyes. [1-59-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: He who reproves me, who am abiding in rigorous ascesis, and who am an unreprovable one by my ascetic 
merit, that irreverent person will be reduced to ashes, and there is no doubt about it. [1-59-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Now they will be dragged by the lasso of Time to the House of Yama, the Terminator, and from now 
to seven hundred births to come they take birth as devourers of corpses, come what may. [1-59-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Those who reprove me will be wandering about these mortal worlds on taking birth as disfigured and 
deformed beings in the ruthless sect of Mustika-s that always feed on dog's flesh. [1-59-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: That wrong-headed Mahodaya also reproached me, who am irreproachable on my part, hence he gets into 
tribal-hood and becomes a reproachable tribal for the entire world. [1-59-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: By my fury he obtains an utter barbarity and he will be occupied with a murderous bent, and he cycles 
through a worst possible living for a long time. [1-59-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b: On saying this much sentence of curse among the sages who have already arrived, that great-resplendent, 
greatly ascetic, great sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-59-22]

[Commentary] The poet in the last line remembers the sages who have already arrived, only to say that, 'had they 
not come at the beck and call of Vishvamitra, they too are liable for the above curses, maybe some more 
curses too, from Vishvamitra. So, knowing this Vedic-ritual of ineligible Trishanku and unqualified 
Vishvamitra is an improper egotistical extravaganza of Vishvamitra, those who have already come, have 
come at the cost of their Brahman-hood.'



SARGA 60
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra effectuates Trishanku's travel to heaven, but Indra throws him down as Trishanku has not 
acquired any merit to reach heaven. Vishvamitra enraged at this starts to replicate universe with constellation 
of stars and galaxies, and he proceeds to clone even gods. On seeing this chaotic situation, Indra with 
gods yield to the pertinence of Vishvamitra and allow that which Vishvamitra replicated to survive and 
also allow Trishanku to inhibit that pseudo Creation, but with an upside down posture.

Shlok 1: "The great-resplendent Vishvamitra on knowing through his ascetic power about the ruination of the sons 
of Vashishta, along with Mahodaya, proclaimed this amidst the observance of sages." Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Trishanku's legend. [1-60-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: 'This legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty is well-know as Trishanku, a righteous and benevolent one. He came 
under my shelter as he wishes to win over the heaven of gods with his own mortal body.' So Vishvamitra 
started to speak to sages. [1-60-2, 3b]

Shlok 3b- 4a: 'You all scholars have to conduct Vedic-ritual along with in such a way as to how Trishnaku reaches 
the heaven of gods.' Thus Vishvamitra advised the conductors of the ritual. [1-60-3b, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: On listening the words of Vishvamitra all those great-sages have come together and quickly discussed 
among themselves about what is agreeable to righteousness, as they are the knowers of scruples of conducting 
Vedic-rituals, but such a ritual is desultory. [1-60-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: Whatever Vishvamitra says let it be translated entirely and exhaustively into deeds called ritual. 
This Vishvamitra is the legatee of Sage Kushi, and indeed he is a saint similar to Ritual-fire besides 
being an extremely furious person. Otherwise this awesome sage gives curse, rancorously. [1-60-5b, 6]

Shlok 7- 8a: 'As such, let the Vedic-ritual be conducted intending and enabling Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku, 
to go to heaven by the ritualist prowess of Vishvamitra, therefor you conduct yourselves and you all 
preside over it.' Thus, the officiators conceded among themselves. [1-60-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: Concluding thus those great-sages undertook concerned works of that Vedic-ritual and the great-resplendent 
Vishvamitra himself became its principal officiator. [1-60-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Those hymnodists who are the experts in hymnodies have scripturally carried out all ceremonies 
in a methodical way with inviolable hymnal methods, and as per Kalpa treatise, that lays down the rules 
for conducting such rituals. [1-60-9b, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: After a long time that highly ascetical Vishvamitra welcomed all the gods to receive their allotted 
oblations in that ritual. [1-60-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12: Then all of the gods who are invited to partake of the oblation have not come forward to receive their 
allotments, and then the great-saint Vishvamitra, obsessive with fury, furiously lifted up a wooden-oblational-scoop, 
and said this to Trishanku. [1-60-11b, 12]

Shlok 13- 14a: Oh, ruler of people, now you shall see the potency of my ascesis which I personally achieved. Such 
as I am I shall lead you forth to haven with your own body just by my personal capability. Oh, king 
of people, now you will go to heaven with your own mortal body, which is otherwise unattainable. [1-60-13, 
14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: 'May it be a little, but there is some fruit of my ascesis, isn't it! Oh, king, you will journey to 
heaven with your own body owing to that prowess of my ascesis.' Vishvamitra said so to Trishanku. [1-60-14b, 
15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: "Once the sage Vishvamitra said those words, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, that king Trishanku soared to heaven 
with his mortal body, before the very eyes of other sages." Sage Shataananda continued. [1-60-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: On seeing Trishanku's entry into the realm of heaven, Indra, the subjugator of demon Paaka, spoke this 
sentence together with all the multitudes of gods. [1-60-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Oh, Trishanku, you have not yet made heaven as your haunt, hence retrace your steps. As you are thrashed 
by the damning of your mentor Vashishta, you inane human, again fall down on earth, but with your head 
inversed. [1-60-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: When Mahendra said so, Trishanku loudly exclaiming at the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra saying, 'save 
me, save me,' and fell down from heaven. [1-60-18b, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: On hearing the exclamatory sentence of Trishanku who is shouting it loudly, Vishvamitra assumed an 
abnormal anger and also said, 'wait... wait...' [1-60-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21- 22a: Like the other Creator that resplendent Vishvamitra, himself staying among sages, has replicated Southerly 
Ursa Major in southerly direction. And still remaining amidst of sages that highly reputed sage Vishvamitra 
further started to replicate the stereotyped stocks of stars sequentially, resorting to the southern 
hemisphere, as he is convulsed in anger at Indra. [1-60-20b, 21, 22a]

[Commentary] Ursa Major is a prominent constellation in the northern sky, containing seven bright stars in a pattern 
variously called the Plough, the Big Dipper, or Charles's Wain. Also called Great Bear. In Latin it 
is, Ursa= greater (she-) bear. The Indian name to this is: saptaRShi-maNDala Hence Vishvamitra 
adopted the opposite direction, namely southern direction, for his Creation, which shall be in direct 
opposition to the natural creation adopted by Almighty. From this point onwards, anything artificially 
or synthetically created, cloned, or replicated from natural item acquired the name of vishvaamitra- 
sR^iSTi 'Vishvamitra's cloning,' including the present day hybrids. Whether this Ursa Major like 
constellation is still available in southern hemisphere - is a point left to astronomers, or stargazers.

Shlok 22b- 23: On replicating the stereotyped stocks of other galaxies and stars, and while fury continued to blemish 
him Vishvamitra said, 'I will now clone an alternative Indra, or let that realm created by me remain 
without any Indra,' and when he is about to proceed to clone even gods in his wrath, the gods are startled. 
[1-60-22b, 23]

Shlok 24: The gods are highly startled at Vishvamitra's creation, and they along with demons and with observances 
of hermits addressed the great-souled Vishvamitra with placatory words. [1-60-24]

Shlok 25: 'Oh great-fortunate Vishvamitra, this king Trishnaku is damned by his mentor, hence oh, ascetically 
wealthy sage, he is not at all eligible to go to heaven with his mortal body.' So said gods to Vishvamitra. 
[1-60-25]

Shlok 26: On hearing that sentence of those gods, the eminent saint Kaushika spoke this highly laudable sentence 
to all of the gods. [1-60-26]

Shlok 27: Let safety betide you all. I have promised to this king Trishanku that he will ascend to heaven with 
his mortal body, and I am not interested to make it untrue. [1-60-27]

Shlok 28- 29: 'Let there be eternal heaven to Trishanku with his mortal body. Next, as along as the worlds remain, 
let all of these stars and galaxies I have created also remain eternally in their places as my creation. 
It will be apt of you all gods to accede to this.' So said Vishvamitra to gods. [1-60-28, 29]

Shlok 30- 31- 32a: When all the gods are addressed thus they replied the eminent saint Vishvamitra saying, 'so be it! 
Safe you be! Let all the created objects prevail in their respective places. Those amazing and numerous 
stars you have created will remain in firmament, but outside the path of stelliform of Cosmic Person. 
Trishanku will also remain in the circle of stars you created, but upside-down, for Indra's indict cannot 
be annulled, and he will be gleaming like a star and similar to any celestial. [1-60-30, 31, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: 'According to their wont to circumambulate someone who has gone to heavenly worlds, all the stars 
will suppliantly circumambulate this best king Trishanku, who has achieved his ends and who has become 
an acclaimed one with your tour de force.' So said gods to Vishvamitra in deterring his further cloning 
of a simulative Universe. [1-60-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: Even the benign-souled Vishvamitra, when reverenced by all gods, that great-resplendent sage without 
stirring himself from among the sages said to all gods, 'Agreed!' [1-60-33]

Shlok 34b: Oh, best one among men Rama, later at the end of that ritual great-souled gods and ascetically wealthy 
sages went away as they have come. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the narration of the legend. [1-60-34]

[Commentary] Trishanku is the son of one Suuryaaruna and his original name is Satyavrat and this name Trishanku is 
his pseudonym. He got this because three sins are attached to him tri-shanka-s 
as said in another work Harivamsha. There it is said: pituH shaapaadi doSheNa | gurudogdhre vadhena 
ca | aprokShito prayogaat ca | trividhaa tat vyatikramaH | evam triiNi asya shankuuni | One by 
his father's damnation - when he misbehaved in his kingdom, his father being a righteous king exiles 
him to a wretched place. When his father was exiling him, Trishanku took umbrage at Vashishta, because 
Vashishta did not come to his rescue. The second blemish is due to the killing Vashishta's milch cow, 
knowingly. Trishanku kills that cow, when he did not get any food for the day to feed the son of Vishvamitra. 
At that time, he had to protect the wife and three sons of Vishvamitra, as Vishvamitra has gone away 
to a distant place for his ascesis, leaving his kingdom and family. Then Trishanku comes to the rescue 
of his family. With that gratitude, now Vishvamitra tries to requite this king in sending him to heaven. 
The third damnation is for his usage of unsanctified meat of his kill. Thus, Trishanku is the one who 
carries 'three social blemishes' on his head, and added to these is the curse of Vashishta, in making 
him as a profaner.

[Commentary] Further, a god or teacher cannot be dragged to one's side or his wishful thinking, but they are to be 
attained or appeased with constant faith and servitude. guroH aliikanirbandho na kartavyaH kadaacana 
| anumaanya prasaaH ca gurukruddho yudhiShTara | shiShyo gurau narashreShTa pratikuulam na sa~ncaret 
| viShNu puraaNa And if god created the cosmos, a man trying to duplicating it, is as good as going 
against that writ of that god. Vishvamitra no doubt built many space stations and started cloning gods, 
leave alone earthly species, but he is forestalled, because he wanted to break the system from within, 
in which he is and by which he mastered all this expertise. It is as good as cutting the branch of a 
tree on which he is sitting. Absolute insolence is absolutely condemnable. Hence, Trishanku is still 
dangling upside down in his so-called heaven.



SARGA 61
------------------------------

[Text] The Legend of Shunashepa is commenced and Sage Shataananda continues this as a part 
of Vishvamitra's legend. When Rama's grandparent Ambariisha undertook a ritual, 
Indra impounds that ritual's horse. Then Ambariisha had to fetch a human-animal 
in lieu of that lost horse. When none is available one named Shunashepa, son of 
Sage Riciika, and a nephew of Vishvamitra, offers himself with a barter of riches 
to his parents.

Shlok 1: "Oh, tigerly man Rama, on giving farewell to those sages who came at his invitation 
and who have started to go back after the ritual of Trishanku is over, then that 
great-resplendent Vishvamitra spoke to all of the sages who are forest dwellers 
that remained with him." Thus Shatananda continued to narrate the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-61-1]

Shlok 2: While depending on this southern quarter this gross hindrance has cropped up 
for my ascesis in the shape of Trishanku's ascent to heaven, hence we will go to 
another direction, and there we continue ascesis. [1-61-2]

Shlok 3: 'Oh, great-souled sages, we can conveniently undertake our ascesis in the vast 
of westerly direction where holy lakesides are there. That would be an august ascetical 
forest, isn't it.' Thus Vishvamitra said to fellow sages in his camp. [1-61-3]

Shlok 4: On saying thus that most brilliant and great saint Vishvamitra performed an unhindered 
and rigorous ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers after reaching the lakeside 
of holy lakes. [1-61-4]

Shlok 5: In the meanwhile the great king of Ayodhya, renowned as Ambariisha, embarked on 
to perform a Vedic-ritual. [1-61-5]

Shlok 6: But Indra impounded the animal of the principal of that ritual, namely king Ambariisha, 
and when that animal is really vanished, the officiant Brahman of the ritual spoke 
this to that king. [1-61-6]

Shlok 7: Oh, king, the animal you have fetched for the ritual has gone astray owing to 
your incautiousness. Oh, king, unguarded items of the ritual will themselves become 
destructive blemishes for that king who is performing the ritual. [1-61-7]

Shlok 8: 'Oh, the best man among men, you have to make great amends for the loss of animal 
as that animal alone which was intended but now missing shall be used in ritual. 
Or, a man may be fetched as ritual-animal, and only after that the deeds of the 
ritual can be continued.' Thus, the priests of the ritual said to king Ambariisha. 
[1-61-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing the words of his teacher, oh, the best one among men, Rama, he that 
highly rule-obedient king tried for a human-ritual-animal for a barter of thousands 
of cows. [1-61-9]

Shlok 10- 11: While that king is searching those and those provinces, villages, forests, townships, 
and even the pious hermitages, oh, dear Rama, the legatee of Raghu's dynasty, that 
king has indeed seen Sage Riciika, who is well settled on Mt. Bhrigutunga along 
with his sons and wife. [1-61-10, 11]

Shlok 12- 13a: On reverencing and on obtaining the grace of ascetically brilliant great Sage Riciika, 
and even on asking him about his wellbeing in every aspect, that kingly sage Ambariisha, 
who is with great resplendence and whose brilliance is illimitable, said this word 
to that sage. [1-61-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Oh, godlike sage, if you bargain your son with a hundred thousand cows for the 
purpose of a ritual-animal, oh, the successor Sage Bhrigu, I deem my ends are achieved. 
[1-61-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: 'All the provinces are went over but unobtainable is that animal of the ritual, 
hence it will be apt of you to give me one son from among your sons, for a value.' 
Thus, king Ambariisha bargained with the sage. [1-61-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: When that great-resplendent Sage Riciika is addressed thus, he said this word, 
'oh, best of men, I cannot possibly sell my eldest son, in anyway.' [1-61-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: On hearing the words of Sage Riciika the mother of those great-souled sons spoke 
this word to the tigerly-man Ambariisha. [1-61-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18: The most reverential sage and the one from Bhaargava dynasty, my husband, said 
that the eldest son is un-sellable. Thereof oh, lord, you must know that my youngest 
son, namely Shunaka, is a cherished one for me. Therefore oh, king, I will not give 
my youngest son to you, either. [1-61-17b, 18]

Shlok 19: 'Generally eldest sons are fathers' favourites, oh, best king among men, and mothers' 
favourites are the youngest, isn't it! Therefor, I have to tend my youngest son.' 
Thus, wife Sage Ruciika said to Ambariisha. [1-61-19]

[Commentary] The wife of the Sage Ruciika is Satyavathi, the sister of Vishvamitra whose legend 
was narrated by Vishvamitra in Bala Ch. 34. This longing for youngest sons by a 
mother is reflected in Maha Bharata, where Kunti pleads for leaving Sahadeva, the 
youngest Pandava, from going to forest exile, along with her in the city. In 
sabhaa-parva she says: sabhaa-parvaNi sahadevam prati kuntiivaakyam - sahadeva nivartasva nanu tvam 
asi me priyaH | shariiraat api maadreyaa maamatyakShiiH kuputravat | - aashramavaase 
dharmaputram prati kuntiivaakyam - sahadevamaaraaja maa pramaadam kR^ithaa | 
- dk Kunti, the mother of Pandava-s says: 'oh, Sahadeva, you refrain 
from going on exile as you are a dear son of mine, though Maadri gave you a bodily 
birth, you are my favourite...' Also, in the period of forest exile she says to 
Yudhishtar: 'oh, king, let no danger occur to Sahadeva... as he is my cherished 
son...'

Shlok 20: Oh, Rama, when that sage's sentence is so, and his wife's sentence is also in that 
way only, their intermediate son, namely Shunashepa, personally spoke this sentence. 
[1-61-20]

Shlok 21: Father said that the eldest son is un-sellable, mother also said the same about 
youngest one. Then I deem that the intermediary son is sellable. Hence, oh, prince, 
you may lead me forth. [1-61-21]

Shlok 22- 23: Oh, dextrous Rama, when that advocate of Veda-s, namely Shunashepa finished his 
speech, then the king gave gold, silver, and gemstones, each in ten million heaps, 
and even a hundred thousand cows, and oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that king Ambariisha 
went away highly gladdened to take Shunashepa with him. [1-61-22, 23]

Shlok 24: "That great resplendent and highly renowned king Ambariisha on his part proceeded 
hastily after ascending Shunashepa onto the chariot that hastily." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued his narration. [1-61-24]



SARGA 62
------------------------------

[Text] Sage Vishvamitra curses his sons as they defy his orders and accords two esoteric 
hymns to Shunashepa, for chanting them in the Vedic-ritual of Ambariisha. Shunashepa 
gets longevity on chanting those hymns. Thus Vishvamitra not only creates another 
universe as in Trishanku's episode, he even accords longevity, or even deathlessness 
to mortals by his ascetic power. Such as he is, he is the mentor of Rama, and hence 
Sage Shataananda informs Rama about the capabilities of his own mentor, Vishvamitra, 
in these many episodes.

Shlok 1: "Oh, Rama, the best one among men and the legatee of Raghu, on taking Shunashepa 
that highly renowned king Ambariisha took rest at noontime on the lakeside of Holy 
Lake." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shunashepa, as a part of Vishvamitra's 
legend. [1-62-1]

Shlok 2- 3a: While the king Ambariisha is taking rest that highly brilliant Shunashepa came 
to the lakeside of main Holy Lake with high anxiety, and there he indeed saw his 
maternal uncle Sage Vishvamitra who is performing ascesis along with other sages. 
[1-62-2, 3a]

Shlok 3b- 4a: Shunashepa became pitiable and sulky faced by strain and thirst, oh, Rama, and 
he immediately fell in the lap of saint Vishvamitra saying this sentence. [1-62-3b, 
4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: I have no mother or a father to save me. Then wherefore cousins or relatives 
will be there to protect me. Oh, peaceable saint the eminent, it will be apt of 
you to protect me according to saintliness. [1-62-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: Oh, illustrious sage, you alone are the saviour to each and every one, isn't 
it! You alone are the guardian angel, isn't it! Hence, let the purpose of the king 
Ambariisha be achieved, and let longevity come to me, and I on becoming imperishable 
and indeed on performing an unexcelled ascesis, I wish to enjoy in heavenly worlds. 
[1-62-5b, 6]

Shlok 7: ' You shall be my providence with a providential sentiment as I stand unprotected, 
and oh, virtue souled one, it will be apt of you to protect me from misfortune, 
like a father protecting his own son.' Thus Shunashepa appealed to Vishvamitra. 
[1-62-7]

Shlok 8: On hearing that sentence of Shunashepa and on pacifying him in many ways, Vishvamitra 
of higher ascesis, indeed said this to his sons. [1-62-8]

Shlok 9: For what reason parents engender sons, desiring positivity and for the purpose 
of welfare in the other worlds, this is the time that has come for fulfilling that 
reason. [1-62-9]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'A father's ambition in begetting sons is to do something good and positive 
to the society in the present world and when departed a right place is acquired 
in heavens through these sons, by their yearly death-day rituals etc., and hence 
you do some good in saving this boy from premature death and earn an apt place for 
me in heavens...'

Shlok 10: This youngster is the son of sage and he aspires shelter from me. Hence, oh, 
sons, give him satisfaction just by giving life to him. [1-62-10]

Shlok 11: You all have done very good pious deeds and you all abide by probity. Hence, 
you bestow appeasement to Fire-god on your becoming the ritual-animals of king Ambariisha 
in lieu of this boy Shunashepa. [1-62-11]

Shlok 12: 'As a result, Shunashepa will have protectors, Vedic-ritual will be unimpeded, 
gods will be oblated, and my word too will be actualised.' Thus Vishvamitra said 
to his sons. [1-62-12]

Shlok 13: But on hearing the saying of the sage, oh, Rama, the best of men, Madhushyanda 
and the other sons of Vishvamitra said this, haughtily and disparagingly. [1-62-13]

Shlok 14: 'On sacrificing your own sons how can you save another's son, oh, lordly father, 
we deem this as a wrongdoing and as good as dog's meat in a dinner.' Thus the sons 
of Vishvamitra replied their father. [1-62-14]

[Commentary] Vishvamitra will be nagged by almost all, including his sons, on this 'dog-meat-eating.' 
There is a parable in Maha Bharata that Vishvamitra once tried to eat dog's meat 
when he did not get any food, but caught red-handedly. Later this has become the 
curse-theme to Vishvamitra when he cursed Vashishta's sons. At the present juncture 
also he curses his own sons with the same theme.

Shlok 15: On listening that saying of his sons that eminent sage Vishvamitra started to curse 
them while fury reddened his eyes. [1-62-15]

Shlok 16: You all have not only transgressed my word, but pertly replied me in an impudent 
manner which is abhorrent and hair-raising, and recriminatory according to probity. 
[1-62-16]

Shlok 17: 'You all will be whirling around the earth totally for a thousand years taking 
birth in the race that subsists on dog's meat, like the sons of Vashishta.' Thus 
Vishvamitra cursed his sons. [1-62-17]

Shlok 18: On making his sons bounden by curse, then that best saint spoke to the pitiable 
Shunashepa, on making unharmed invulnerability to him with sanctifying hymns. [1-62-18]

Shlok 19: When you are fastened with sacred fastener to the sacrificial post of Vishnu, 
smeared with red paste and garlanded with red garlands, you praisefully address 
the Fire-god with the words I going to impart to you in Vedic hymns. [1-62-19]

Shlok 20: 'These two divine hymns, oh, son of saint, shall be chanted in the Vedic-ritual 
of Ambariisha, then you will obtain your aspiration.' Thus Vishvamitra taught two 
Vedic hymns to the boy. [1-62-20]

Shlok 21: Shunashepa having taken those two hymns from Vishvamitra very attentively has instantly 
gone to that lion-king Ambariisha and indeed spoke to him. [1-62-21]

Shlok 22: 'Oh, the lion-king, let us go promptly to your ritual place, oh, best king, you 
may apply yourself to your pledge in completing the ritual, with me as its sacrificial 
animal,' thus the boy said. [1-62-22]

Shlok 23: On listening that sentence of the son of sage, the king Ambariisha is gladdened 
and proceeded to the ritual hall immediately and spiritedly. [1-62-23]

Shlok 24: The king with the permission of officiators of ritual got the boy prepared as a 
ritual animal with sanctified bodily features and clad him in red clothes and got 
him securely fastened to the sacrificial post. [1-62-24]

Shlok 25: When Shunashepa is tied to ritual post he immensely pleased two gods, namely Indra 
and Upendra as well, with those two hymns he got from Vishvamitra. [1-62-25]

Shlok 26: Then the Thousand-eyed Indra who is satisfied with esoteric laudation is gladdened, 
and oh, Raghava, then he bestowed longevity to Shunashepa. [1-62-26]

Shlok 27: Oh, Rama, the best one among men, he that king Ambariisha also obtained the fruits 
of that Vedic-ritual in manyfold, resulted from the grace of Thousand-eyed Indra. 
[1-62-27]

Shlok 28: "Oh, Rama, the best among men, even the virtue-souled great ascetic Vishvamitra 
again performed ascesis at the same Holy lakeside for another thousand years." Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued the narration of Vishvamitra's legend. [1-62-28]



SARGA 63
------------------------------

[Text] On Vishvamitra's performing severe ascesis Brahma accords the sageship of 'Great-sage' 
to him, whereas Vishvamitra's ambition is to acquire the sageship of a 'Brahma-sage' 
Absolute-sageship. In the meanwhile, the celestial wench Menaka arrives at that 
place and Vishvamitra is enticed by her beauty and spends some years with her. Later, 
on realising the he should have won over lust, he further undertakes severe ascesis, 
by which gods are perturbed.

Shlok 1: "When thousand years are completed in ascesis and when that great saint Vishvamitra 
took a bath of solemnity, all the gods have come forward wishing to accord the fruit 
of that ascesis to Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. 
[1-63-1]

Shlok 2: The very highly resplendent Brahma spoke to him with highly palatable words, 'you 
have now become a kingly sage by virtue of auspicious deeds you have personally 
undertaken, let safeness betide you.' [1-63-2]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'so far, you are a king and by your auspicious deeds now you have become 
a 'kingly sage' raajaSi and to attain a still higher brahmarSi 
'Absolute sageship' you are not yet merited... as the Absolute sageship will be 
endowed to those who are above the negative traits of humans, like greed, anger, 
lust, jealousy etc.'

Shlok 3: On speaking to Vishvamitra in that way Brahma returned to heaven, and that highly 
vigorous Vishvamitra again performed a great ascesis. [1-63-3]

[Commentary] The word vi in the name of Vishvamitra is taken as the third syllable in 
Gayatri Hymn.

Shlok 4: Then at a long lost time Menaka, the prominent apsara, celestial wench, has arrived 
and started to swim for sport in that holy lake. [1-63-4]

Shlok 5: That great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has seen Menaka who is incomparable in 
her mien and comparable to an electric-flash in a black-cloud, while she is swimming 
in the holy lake. [1-63-5]

Shlok 6- 7a: On seeing her the sage having gone under the sway the Love-god said this to her, 
'oh, apsara, you are welcome, I invite you to bide in my hermitage. Oblige me who 
am bewitched by Love-god for you. You be safe.' [1-63-6, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8- 9a: When he said thus to her, oh, Raghava, then she made a stopover there and ten years 
rolled by comfortably, and oh, gentle Rama, because of her staying Vishvamitra is 
indeed faced with a great hindrance in his ascesis. [1-63-7b, 8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: Then after the lapse of that ten year period Vishvamitra became doleful with distress 
and he is enwrapped in humiliation, as it were, and, oh, Rama, Raghu's legatee, 
then a resentful thought occurred to him. [1-63-9b, 10]

Shlok 11- 12a: All this is the mischief of gods to defraud me of the great merit of my ascesis. 
Ten years have rolled by as if they are just a day and a night. Furthermore, I who 
am under the influence of lust and lure had to encounter this hindrance in my ascesis. 
[1-63-11, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13- 14a: Oh, Rama, that best saint suspired heavily when he became emotional with reparation. 
But on seeing the scared celestial wench Menaka, who is shivering and waiting with 
suppliantly adjoined palms, he sent her away with pleasant words, and he that Vishvamitra 
indeed went to the northern Himalayan mountain. [1-63-12b, 13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: He that highly celebrated sage who made a resolve to attain a sang-froid temperament 
and to vanquish lust, performed an unsurpassable ascesis on reaching the riverbank 
of River Kaushiki. [1-63-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Oh, Rama, while he reverently performed an unspeakable ascesis for a thousand years 
on the northern mountain, namely Himalayas, then fear occurred to gods. [1-63-15b, 
16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: ' All gods coming together with assemblages of sages have approached Brahma and conveyed 
that, 'this Vishvamitra, the son of Kushika, may duly be given the epithet of 'Maharshi, 
Exalted Sage.' [1-63-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: On listening the advice of gods, Brahma, the Grandparent of all the worlds, spoke 
these pleasant words to the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra. [1-63-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: 'Oh, exalted sage, I welcome you my dear, as I am gladdened by your stern ascesis, 
oh, Kaushika, I bestow upon you the sublimity and supremacy among sages.' [1-63-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: And on hearing the words of Brahma he that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra became 
obeisant and replied the Grandparent adjoining his palms suppliantly. [1-63-19b, 
20a]



'If your Godhead had said that I am a Brahma-sage, a sageship acquired personally 
by my pious deeds, rather than an exalted sage, then I would have become one who 
is really self-conquered.' Thus Vishvamitra said to Brahma. [1-63-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: Brahma then said to him, 'your senses remain unconquered as such, oh, tigerly sage, 
make an effort for it.' Saying so Brahma went heavenward. [1-63-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: While the gods who came here along with Brahma have returned, that great sage Vishvamitra 
undertook another round of ascesis by standing in levitation, upraising his arms, 
and subsisting on air alone. [1-63-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24: In summer he became the Five-Fire Ascetic, in rainy season open sky is his rooftop, 
and in winter water is his reclining bed even by day or by night, and thus that 
ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra indeed undertook a severe ascesis in this way, for 
another thousand years. [1-63-23b, 24]

[Commentary] Five fires are four Fires in four directions and the fifth one is the scorching 
sun, overhead. An ascetic staying among these five fires will become an ascetic 
fire. The first word in first foot dharme, will also used as gharme, 
as above, in some mms.

Shlok 25: While that great saint is undertaking fervent ascesis it has become a very high 
burning problem to gods and even to Indra. [1-63-25]

Shlok 26: "Then Indra along with all the assemblages of the Air-gods spoke to Rambha, the 
celestial wench, words that are advantageous to himself, but disadvantageous to 
the son of sage Kushi, namely Vishvamitra." Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration. [1-63-26]



SARGA 64
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra curses Rambha, the celestial wench, knowing that she arrived at the behest of Indra to cause 
hindrance to his ascesis. But later feels ashamed to loose his tongue and then he is determined to undertake 
another round of ascesis to conquer is own senses.

Shlok 1: "Oh, Rambha, now you have to undertake this very great task of gods in enchanting Vishvamitra with 
a craving caused by lust, for lusting after you.' Thus Indra ordered Rambha..." Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-64-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, Rama, when that celestial wench is spoken thus by the Thousand-eyed Indra, she diffidently said 
to that chief of gods while adjoining her palms suppliantly. [1-64-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: 'Oh, chief of gods, Indra, that great saint Vishvamitra is a dangerous one and undoubtedly he releases 
his deadly anger on me. Oh, god, thereby I am fearful of him. Hence, oh, god, it will be apt of you 
to accord forbearance.' So said Rambha to Indra. [1-64-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5a: Oh, Rama, the Thousand-eyed Indra replied Rambha when she spoke to him in that way while shuddering 
in fear and making palm fold in supplication. [1-64-4b, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6: You need not be fearful, Rambha, carry out my command, safe betides you, I on becoming a heart-stealing 
black-songbird will be at your side along with Love-god in the pleasing trees of springtime. [1-64-5b, 
6]

Shlok 7: 'Indeed on your assuming a highly sparkling semblance, and multi-multiplexing your savoir faire, with 
bon viveurs and bon vivants, you disengage that ascetical sage Kaushika from his ascesis.' So said Indra 
to Rambha. [1-64-7]

Shlok 8: On hearing the sentence of Indra she adopted an unexcelled physique, and on becoming a pulchritudinous 
damsel she started to entice Vishvamitra with giggly grins. [1-64-8]

Shlok 9: Vishvamitra has heard melodious trilling tune of songbird, and while his heart is highly gladdening 
about the ambience, he incidentally saw and stared at Rambha. [1-64-9]

Shlok 10: By the exceptional trilling tune of that songbird and by the unexceptional tableau of Rambha the sage 
is on his qui vive. [1-64-10]

Shlok 11: On knowing that as an escapade of the Thousand-eyed Indra, Vishvamitra is enwrapped in wrath and he 
cursed Rambha. [1-64-11]

Shlok 12: Whereof you tried to entice me who am wishing to win over the wanton and wroth, you unlucky female 
Rambha, thereof you will become a rocklike statued wastrel. [1-64-12]

Shlok 13: 'A highly resplendent Brahman who is ascetically powerful redeems you, oh, Rambha, who are now blemished 
by my anger.' Vishvamitra cursed Rambha in this way. [1-64-13]

[Commentary] This ascetically powerful Brahman-saviour of Rambha is none other than the Sage Vashishta, the brainchild 
of Brahma. Even though Vishvamitra is at loggerheads with Vashishta, he holds Vashishta in high respect.

Shlok 14: Thus the great-resplendent Vishvamitra became compunctious when that great-saint could not contain 
his anger in uttering an angry curse. [1-64-14]

[Commentary] Angering for trivial reasons, or on trivially inferiors ones is a demeritorious triviality in loosing 
ascetic power. Irrestrainable temperament will not only ruin the ascetic powers but also breeds a prolonged 
compunction. Manu defines jitendriya as one who shrutvaa spR^iShTvaa ca dR^iShTvaa ca 
bhuktvaa ghraatvaa ca yau naraH | na hR^iShyati glaayati vaa sa vij~neyo jitendriyaH || - manu'he 
who on hearing, touching, seeing, eating, smelling, but neither gladdens nor saddens, is a self-senses-conquered 
one...' The same is said in Bhagavad Gita, and the whole of karma-yoga deals with the same 
subject, and it is said there: tasmaat tvam indriyaaNyaadau niyamya bharatarShabha paapmaanam prajahi 
hyenam j~naanavij~naananaashanam || giitaa 3-41

[Commentary] He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, / Disparting self from service, soul from works, 
/ Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince! / Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain / With sword of 
wisdom, Son of Bharata! - Sir Edwin Arnold.

Shlok 15: Then Rambha has become a rocklike statue by that great curse of Vishvamitra, and having heard the words 
of that great-saint Love-god and Indra also took flight. [1-64-15]

Shlok 16: Owing to his angering that great-resplendent Vishvamitra is now divested of his ascetical merit, and 
he has no peace of mind owing to ungovernable senses. [1-64-16]

Shlok 17: His conscience became sentimental owing to the divesture of his ascetical merit, and he soliloquised, 
'I shall not succumb to wrath in anyway, nor I put my presentiment into words.' [1-64-17]

Shlok 18: Otherwise, I do not even respire for a hundred years for the respiratory gestures will also exhibit 
moods, and I indeed emaciate myself until I become a real conqueror of my own senses. [1-64-18]

Shlok 19: 'Till such time as I acquire Brahman-hood with the merit of my own ascesis I will be breathless and 
foodless, even if it is going to take endless years, and while I am in ascesis my bodily organs indeed 
will not undergo any deterioration.' So said Vishvamitra to himself. [1-64-19]

Shlok 20: "Thus that eminent sage abided by the commitment to the vow for a thousand years, oh, Rama, the legatee 
of Ragu, which is a nonpareil vow in the world." Thus Shataananda continued. [1-64-20]



SARGA 65
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra becomes Brahma-sage after a prolonged ascesis that made all the worlds 
to startle. All gods request Brahma to accord the supreme Brahma-sageship on Vishvamitra 
as he is cleansed of all mortal impurities, and Brahma accords that highest order 
on him. Thus Sage Shataananda concludes his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra.

Shlok 1: "That great-saint Vishvamitra then leaving off the snowbound Himalayas on north, 
oh, Rama, he reached eastern quarter and undertook rigorous ascesis." Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-65-1]

Shlok 2: Committing himself to a vow of muteness, oh, Rama, he performed an unexcelled and 
unmatched ascesis which is highly impracticable for others to perform. [1-65-2]

Shlok 3- 4a: Even on completing a thousand years, even when that great-saint became woodenly, 
even many barriers are at full blast, oh, Rama, fury has not entered his heart of 
hearts, for he stood fast in an unmitigated ascesis on making a firm determination. 
[1-65-3, 4a]

Shlok 4b- 5: On one day when those thousand years of ascesis with the rigorous pledge of Vishvamitra 
are being completed, and when he started to eat his meal, oh, Rama, best of Raghu's 
dynasty, Indra arrived there disguising himself as a Brahman and requested for the 
readily available meal. [1-65-4b, 5]

[Commentary] This meal is prepared by Vishvamitra alone after a thousand years and such self-cooking 
of food by the ascetics is called, vaishvadevam, since it is a sacred 
preparation anena vaishvadeva ante samaagato atithiH svayam upoShyaapi sviiya annapradaanena 
sambhojya iti suucitam - dk

Shlok 6: Then that godly Vishvamitra willingly gave away all the readied meal to that Brahman, 
and as no meal is leftover by Brahman-Indra, that great-ascetic Vishvamitra starved 
himself. Vishvamitra did not speak a little to the Brahman in dissent as he is abided 
by his pledge of muteness, and he again remained in muteness and breath-control. 
Like that, he indeed carried on his ascesis. [1-65-6, 7]

Shlok 8- 9a: That eminent saint remained without respiration for another thousand years, and 
then fumes have started to emit from the head of sage who is controlling his breath, 
by which fumes the triad of worlds looked as if it is searing, and this startled 
all the worlds. [1-65-8, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10: Then the gods, sages, gandharva-s, serpents, reptiles, demons are puzzled at the 
ascesis of Vishvamitra, and as their own resplendence is dulled by the ascesis of 
Vishvamitra, thereby they are marred by this blemish of lowered resplendence, then 
all of them addressed the Grandparent, Brahma. [1-65-9b, 10]

Shlok 11: Even if that great-saint Vishvamitra is angered and allured in order to foil 
his ascetical ascendancy, by all of us and by all means oh, god, he is transcending 
these lures, angers, and passions by his ascesis. [1-65-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: Now, even an imperceptible imperfection does not really appear in him, but if 
his heartfelt desire is not meted out, he will devastate the triad of worlds with 
his ascetic power. [1-65-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: All the directions are all tumultuous, all the oceans are tempestuous, and all 
the mountains are eruptive, and nothing is bright. [1-65-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: The earth is highly tremulous, air is gusting turbulently, oh, Brahma, people 
tend to become non-theistic and we do not know what to do. [1-65-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: All the beings in the triad of the worlds are very highly perturbed at their 
senses and they are as though stupefied, and when juxtaposed the sun is lustreless 
before the resplendence of that great sage. [1-65-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: Oh, God, great saint Vishvamitra turned out to be the embodiment of Fire-god, 
and before that great-resplendent and most reverential sage makes up his mind for 
total destruction of all worlds he is to be placated. [1-65-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: 'As to how the End-Time Fire entirely blazed away the triad of worlds previously, 
now this sage may do likewise, hence whatever is his predilection that may be given 
to him, even if he wants to become the potentate on the realm of gods.' Thus, all 
gods appealed to Brahma [1-65-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: Then all the assemblages of gods keeping the Grandparent Brahma in their forefront 
appeared before that great souled Vishvamitra and said this harmonious word. [1-65-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: Oh, Brahma-sage, you are welcome. We are much contented with your ascesis. Oh, 
Kaushika, you have achieved Bahaman-hood by your rigorous ascesis. [1-65-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: 'Along with the assemblages of Marut-Wind-gods, I bestow upon you a long life. 
Let blissfulness betide you. You be safe. Oh, gentle sage, you may take leave as 
you please.' Thus, Brahma said to Vishvamitra. [1-65-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: On hearing the word of Grandparent Brahma and the other residents of heaven, and 
on paying good devoirs to all of them that great saint cheerfully said. [1-65-21b, 
22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: If Brahman-hood and eternality have befallen on me, let the quintessence of AUM 
and vaSat syllables, and even all Veda-s patronise me. [1-65-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: 'Oh, gods, he who is the outstanding one among the geniuses of kingcraft, and 
among the scholars of Veda-s as well, even that Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma, 
shall acknowledge me in this way as Brahma-sage. Oh, the best gods, you may take 
leave if you can effectuate this ultimate yearning of mine.' Thus Vishvamitra requested 
the gods. [1-65-23b, 24]

Shlok 25: Then the best one among meditators Vashishta has come over there when the gods 
besought him to come, and he made friendship with Vishvamitra. He also said in this 
way to Vishvamitra, 'you are a Brahma-sage.' [1-65-25]

Shlok 26: 'No doubt, you are a Brahma-sage and everything will accrue to you in accordance 
with the sublimity of this sageship,' and when Vashishta said so to Vishvamitra, 
all the gods have gone away as they have come. [1-65-26]

Shlok 27: On getting his Brahman-hood even the virtue-souled Vishvamitra started to reverence 
the supreme among meditators and his counterpart Brahma-sage, namely Vashishta. 
[1-65-27]

Shlok 28: When his aim is effectuated Vishvamitra ambled all over the earth abiding in ascesis, 
and oh, Rama, this great souled sage Vishvamitra achieved Brahman-hood in this way. 
[1-65-28]

Shlok 29: "Oh, Rama, he is the best saint, he is the embodiment of ascesis, he is always obliged 
with righteousness, and he is the stronghold for fortitude." [1-65-29]

Shlok 30- 31a: On narrating the legend of Vishvamitra in this way that best Brahman and great-resplendent 
Sage Shataananda took respite. And on listening the narration of Sage Shataananda 
said in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, king Janaka said this sentence to Kushika's 
son, Vishvamitra, with suppliantly adjoined palms. [1-65-30b, 31a]

Shlok 31b- 32a: Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, you happened to be here at this Vedic-ritual which 
is conducted by me, oh, Kaushika, that too, along with Rama and Lakshmana, the legatees 
of Kakutstha, thereby I am fortunate, I am much obliged. [31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: Oh, Brahman, I stand consecrated just by your graceful glance, and oh, great saint, 
I reckon that I have achieved many boons just glancing at you. [1-65-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: Oh, great-resplendent Brahman, myself and the noble souled Rama have heard about 
your great ascesis when Sage Shataananda extolled it comprehensively. [1-65-33b, 
34a]

Shlok 34b- 35: The congregationalists available in this Vedic-ritual congregation have also heard 
about your numerous endowments. Inestimable is your ascesis, infinite is your power, 
and oh, son of Kushika, your talents are everlastingly invaluable. [1-65-34b, 35]

Shlok 36: Oh, lord, there is no contentment to me while listening to your wondrous narratives, 
but oh nobleman, time for vespertine ritual is fast approaching as sun's sphere 
is dangling westward. [1-65-36]

Shlok 37: "Oh, great-resplendent sage, it will be apt of you to see me tomorrow. Oh, best 
meditator, it will be apt of you to permit me to leave for now." Thus Janaka sought 
leave from Vishvamitra. [1-65-37]

Shlok 38: When he is spoken in that way, the best saint Vishvamitra is pleased at heart, and 
praising Janaka, who too is pleased to meet the sage, immediately bid farewell to 
the best one among men, namely Janaka. [1-65-38]

Shlok 39: This way on saying to the best saint, the king of Mithila and the legatee of Videha 
lineage, immediately performed circumambulations along with his teachers and relatives 
to Vishvamitra in veneration. [1-65-39]

Shlok 40: Even that virtue souled Vishvamitra started towards his own camp along with Rama 
and Lakshmana, while being venerated by great sages who are available in the ritual-hall. 
[1-65-40]



SARGA 66
------------------------------

[Text] Legend of Shiva's bow is narrated as Vishvamitra asks Janaka to show that bow to 
Rama and Lakshmana, as they have come this far to have a glimpse of that great bow. 
Janaka, while narrating its history, makes an offer saying that his daughter Seetha 
will be given in marriage, if only Rama can string the bowstring of Shiva's bow. 
In the very same sixty-sixth chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, Valmiki narrates the birth 
of Hanuma through Jambavanta, elaborately. But here Valmiki informs through Janaka 
about the nature of birth of Seetha, very concisely, which gave raise to too much 
of debate about this enigmatic Seetha and her birth. Some points are given in the 
endnote.

Shlok 1: Then on performing morning time rites in the aurora of next morning, king Janaka 
invited great souled Vishvamitra, along with Raghava-s. [1-66-1]

Shlok 2: On reverencing Vishvamitra and the noble souled Raghava-s according to the formalities 
envisaged by scriptures, then the virtue souled Janaka spoke these words, indeed. 
[1-66-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, god, you are welcome, oh, holy sage, bid me as to what I should for you, for 
I am biddable by you, indeed... [1-66-3]

Shlok 4: When said thus by the foreseer Janaka, [who can foresee as to why Vishvamitra came 
with Raghava-s this far, and thus asked him as to what next is to be done,] that 
sage Vishvamitra, for he is presager and wordsmith, [and who knows what is to be 
done next,] said these words in reply to that valiant king Janaka. [1-66-4]

Shlok 5: These two are the sons of Dasharatha, well-renowned Kshatriya-s in world, and they 
are desirous to see that marvellous bow which has a place with you... [1-66-5]

Shlok 6: You may show that bow, well bodes you, and on beholding that bow the desire of 
these two princes will come true, and they will go back as they like... [1-66-6]

Shlok 7: But Janaka replied the great sage Vishvamitra when he was addressed thus, "I shall 
[firstly] tell by which reason that bow has its place here... [1-66-7]

Shlok 8: Oh, godly sage, there was a king renowned as Devaraata, sixth one from Nimi, [the 
originator of our lineage,] and this bow was handed down to him for custodial care 
by the Sublime Soul, Shiva... [1-66-8]

[Commentary] Some mms use the word jyeSTaH instead of SaSTa for Nimi 
and then the meaning is that Nimi's eldest son is Devaraata. Basing on the account 
that is given by Janaka at the time of Rama's mariage with Seetha, Devaraata is 
the sixth one from Nimi, the originator of Janaka's lineage.

Shlok 9: Once, during the devastation of the Vedic-ritual of Daksha Prajapati, the mettlesome 
god Rudra, rancorously outstretching the bowstring of this bow, said this to all 
gods, superciliously... [1-66-9]

Shlok 10: 'Oh, gods, whereby you have not apportioned my portion [of oblations in Vedic-ritual 
s, as I am also the] desirer of such portion, [thereby] I will shred the highly 
revered heads of yours with this bow...' [So said Shiva to gods.] [1-66-10]

Shlok 11: Then, oh, best saint Vishvamitra, all gods are truly dismayed, and on their supplicating, 
Bhava, namely Shiva, the God of Gods is gladdened... [1-66-11]

Shlok 12- 13a: And that Sublime Soul Shiva gladly gave that bow to all of the great souled gods, 
and oh, godly saint, then those great souled gods gave this gem of a bow of Shiva, 
the God of Gods, to our ancestor [Devaraata,] for custodial care... [1-66-12, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough [from the 
furrow is a baby girl... since she is] gained while consecrating the ritual-field, 
she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned... [1-66-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Hers is a non-uterine birth as she surfaced from the surface of the earth, but 
fostered as my own soul-born girl and I determined [to give her in marriage to 
a bridegroom where his] boldness is the only bounty, [I receive in that marriage...] 
[1-66-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] Comment: 'Dowry is property or money brought by a bride to her husband' and this 
is familiar throughout the world. In ancient India, there was a counterpart custom 
to this, called kanyaashulkam meaning 'some bounty, property or money 
offered by a bridegroom's family to the bride's family' since they are getting a 
worthy bride, coming into their family, not just as a mere wife of the bridegroom, 
but to upkeep and promote that family and its progeny. And this dowry or its counterpart 
is not compulsorily be paid in hard cash, but it may be any kind of gifts mutually 
exchanged, which has slowly developed into a mega havoc these days. Here Janaka 
wants the 'valour' of his prospective son-in-law as bounty due to him in the marriage 
of Seetha.

Shlok 15b- 16a: Oh, eminent sage, as my daughter has surfaced from the surface of earth and has 
come of age, the kings, [having heard my declaration that the bounty for Seetha 
is boldness alone,] have come and besought for her... [1-66-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: To all of those kings who are beseeching for the girl, I have not given my daughter, 
saying that she will be given for a bounty of boldness... [1-6-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Then all the kings convoked and on arriving at Mithila, then they wanted to ascertain 
the calibre [of the bow, vis-a-vis their own...] [1-66-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: For them, those who wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, that bow of Shiva 
is fetched to their proximity, but they are incapable to joggle it, or even to catch 
hold of it... [1-66-18b, 19a]

[Commentary] Comment: This bow of Shiva will be transported on a wheeled casket-cart with eight 
wheels and drawn by five thousand robust persons. This is narrated in next chapter. 
'It is drawn by drawn by five hundred bulls...' aananda-raamayana says 
so. In other versions of Ramayana, it is said that many people will pull that casket-cart, 
as one or two persons cannot haul it. Once, when Seetha was playing with other girls, 
their flowery ball of girl's rugby goes under this cart. None of her girlfriends 
is dare enough to near this bow-casket-cart, since it is a reverential casket-cart. 
But Seetha goes there and pushes that casket-cart aside with her left hand, as though 
it is a garland, and retrieves that flower ball. This capability of Seetha in easy 
handling of Shiva's bow, becomes a bane to her, when one among the wives of 
sapta-R^iSi 'Seven Sages...' issues a curse to Seetha, saying that 'Seetha 
will be separated from her husband for some time, of course, for the good of people...' 
So says the tradition.

Shlok 19b- 20a: Oh, great saint, on knowing the valour of those valorous ones as valueless, I countermanded 
them... oh, ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, by that you may know [the sequel of 
it...] [1-66-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: Then, oh, eminent sage, those kings beleaguered Mithila in a blind fury, since 
a self-mistrust bechanced among them all, about their own valour... [1-66-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: They surmised for themselves that they are brushed off by me, and they possessed 
by a high rancour, they strangled the City of Mithila... [1-66-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b- 23a: Then elapsed is an year and in anyway the possessions for livelihood went into 
a decline, oh, eminent sage, thereby I am highly anguished [1-66-22b, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24a: Then I have assuaged the assemblages of gods by my ascesis and gods are also highly 
gladdened and gave me fourfold forces... [1-66-23b, 24a]

[Commentary] Comment: The four components of army are foot soldiers, cavalry, elephant-squadrons, 
and chariot-warriors.

Shlok 24b- 25a: Then those evildoers and self-mistrustful kings while being drubbed [by the heaven-sent 
army, they have become] vigourless and broken, and they beat a hasty retreat... 
[1-66-24b, 25a]

Shlok 25b- 26a: Oh, tigerly sage this is that supremely radiant bow, and oh, saint of sacred vows, 
I will show it, even to Rama and Lakshmana... [1-66-25b, 26a]

[Commentary] Comment: Here by the use of word 'even' 'also' Janaka is reckoning Rama or Lakshmana 
on par with other kings who have tried their hand in lifting it. As of now, Janaka 
is not admitting any supremeness or super-humanness to them. In Janaka's asking 
at verse 4 'what can I do next...' etc., Janaka has sensed as to why this Vishvamitra 
brought some boys on this long a route, that too by foot. But he is not yet self-assured 
of Rama's capability or otherwise. Hence, the next verse starts with the clause 
'if'.

Shlok 26b: "If Rama strings the bowstring of that bow, oh, sage, I will offer my daughter, 
whose birth is non-uterine, to Dasharatha's Rama..." [So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.] 
[1-66-26b, c]

[Commentary] In the endnote of Ch. 56 of Aranya Kanda, some details are given about the enigmatic 
Seetha. Here also some points about her enigmatic birth are presented.

[Commentary] Seetha is considered to be the nature's nature, Primordeal 
Nature, mahaa-prakriti, and when the five elements of nature intermingle 
into one, that is the Manifest Nature, where the five elements are
pridhvi, aapa, teja, vaayu, aakaasha 'earth, waters, 
fire, air and space...' and there are many theories of their commingling like,
panchiikaraNa, saptiikaraNa quintuplication, and sevenfold 
commingling etc. The process of creation gives rise to 24 items: 1] empirical or 
fundamental matter, 2] mahat, 3] ahamkaara, 4-8] five subtle elements, 9-13] five 
gross elements, 14] mind, 15-19] five sense organs, 20-24] five motor organs, 25] 
jiivaatma, individual's soul, 26] Brahman, The Absolute. With these, a created 
living being is created. This is in the case of mortals and their births. But when 
Seetha is found in the furrow all these things have already happened and there is 
no question of human pregnancy to be attached to her. Hence Seetha is to be taken 
as Goddess Lakshmi, who is paraa-shakti, Vishnu-Maayaa 
and when she has to take an incarnation to become the prime cause to the effect 
of eliminating Ravana, no human activity of reproduction can be attached to such 
beings. If she were to be a human, perhaps she would not have exited from the pyre 
of fire when she self-immolated, after Rama and Ravana war. Some more information, 
though unrelated to Valmiki Ramayana, is given hereunder.

[Commentary] Lakshmi evolved from the Milky Ocean, when gods and demons churned it for
amrita, the Divine Elixir, along with it a host of 
other items like, haalaahala, [cosmic poison,]
candra Moon, kalpa-vrikSha, 
[Benevolent Divine Tree,] and the medicinal sage-god Dhanvantari 
holding the golden pot of amrita, have come out as 
has been explained by Vishvamitra to Rama in this Kanda.

[Commentary] Vishnu is the all-inclusive deity, known as puruSa 
or mahaa-puruSa... parama aatma Supreme Person,
naraayaNa one who peregrinates mortals in and out this 
mortal world, antaryAmi The In-dweller of all beings, 
and He is the sheShin the Totality, in whom all souls 
are contained. He is bhagavat where
bhaga, derives from the root 
bhaj meaning Gracious Lord, and vat one who 
has it. Vishnu possesses six such divine glories SaD-guna- 
vibhuuti, namely, 1] j~naana, Omniscience 2]
aishwarya, Providence, 3] shakti, 
Omnicompetence, 4] bala, Omnipotence, 5]
viirya, Immutability. 6] tejas, 
Resplendence, shakti is the samvit, 
the Primary Intelligence of God, while the other five attributes emerge from this
samvid and hence shakti 
is the god's ahamata Personality and Activity. Thus 
this Shakti of god is personified in mythological lore and is called Shri or Lakshmi, 
and She is said to manifest herself in, 1] kriyaa-shakti, 
Creative Activity and 2] bhuuti-shakti, Creation of 
God. Hence Vishnu cannot part with His own personality or creativity i.e.,
ahamta, which in its feminine form is called
shrii or Lakshmi. He therefore 
needs His consort Goddess Lakshmi to be with Him always, untouched by any. Thus, 
Goddess Lakshmi has to accompany Vishnu in all His incarnations, along with other 
paraphernalia like his conch-shell, his quoit and mace, and the thousand headed 
serpent aadisheSa etc. Such a delightful deity Goddess 
Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, but she is fickle 
like ripples lakShmii hi toyatarangacapalaa Lakshmi= Goddess Lakshmi; 
hi= indeed; toya= water; taranga= wave like; capalaa= wavering. 'Goddess Lakshmi 
is wavering like the waves of water...' chapala, chanchala, 
asthira, wavering, faltering, unstable, and maayaa, 
maa + yaa 'whose illusory play she is, or liilaa 
play of god. She comes in unnoticeably like the water in a coconut and evaporates 
innocently into thin air, at Her will. Such as she is she is easily grabbed by the 
greedy. Hence none can give birth to her except the Mother Nature, and hence she 
is called mahilaa ; mahi + laa where
mahi is earth and laa ; laH khaNDane 
triSu aadaane stri because Mother Earth gave birth to Seetha, Seetha is
mahilaa Hence it is better to avoid assuming her to 
be an ordinary lady of an ordinary birth, and she may be viewed either legendarily 
or mythologically, for Valmiki as an epical poet, himself has not chronicled the 
details of her birth.

[Commentary] Even Vishnu is deprived of Her in His incarnations, not only in Ramayana but also 
in His nR^isimha Man-Lion incarnation. There, Maya 
Lakshmi becomes a tribal woman to bring back the ferocious Lion-Man to his original 
form. And in other versions of Ramayana, it is said that Ravana abducted Maya Seetha, 
but not real Seetha. 'When the real Seetha herself is an enigma, what if Ravana 
abducts real or duplicate copy of that Seetha...' is the brushed aside adjustment. 
In either case, it is maayaa, liilaa illusory power, sport 
of Vishnu together with that of Goddess Lakshmi, cause this enigma. Hence, whenever 
She is thus absconding from Him, Vishnu searches and retrieves Her, for no one in 
Universe can handle her, nor amass all the wealth. The predestined wealth alone 
is enjoyable but nothing more can be amassed. So also are the riches in the present 
day world, come too suddenly and vanish that suddenly. No one is rich ever and anon, 
and on someday every one is likely to see the ups and downs in his graph of riches. 
It is Vishnu that retrives the real wealth back to His abode
VaikunTha, and even punishes anyone for his accumulation 
of beyond-the-means-wealth. The burning of Lanka by Hanuma in Sundara Kanda is an 
example to this.

[Commentary] In Lakshmi-tantra , a Vaishnavaite 
aagama text, She that unrestrainable Goddess Lakshmi declares Herself, as
naaraayaNii, vaiSNavii i.e., a coequal of Vishnu, in 
the play of the universe i.e., in God's liilaa, saying 
that: aham naaraayaNii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa 'I am indeed
naaraayaNii i.e. Lakshmi, the Supreme Essence of Vishnu... 
[Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.]

[Commentary] The Hindu mythology bases more on its eighteen Puraana-s, each of the six is rendered 
to each of the Hindu Trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. A]
Vishnu Puraana-s are: - 1] Vishnu, 
2] bhaagavata, 3] naaradiiya, 4] garuda, 5] padma. 6] varaaha. B]
Brahma Puraana-s : -1] Brahma, 
2] brahmaanda, 3] brahmavaivarta, 4] maarkandeya, 5] bhaviSya,6] vaamana. 
C] Shiva Puraana-s : - 1] vaayu, 
2] linga, 3] skanda, 4] agni, 5] matsya, 6] kuurma. In all these Puraana-s 
Goddess Lakshmi is given a laudable place without any sectarian dispute. In the 
Vaishnavaite Puraana-s, Shiva starts telling the efficacy of Vishnu to Goddess Parvati. 
While Shaiva mythology places Goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva, in one half 
of Shiva's body ardhanaariishvara-tattva, and Vaishnavaite 
tradition places Goddess Lakshmi in the heart of Vishnu itself, as if it is a Lotus
hridayakamala. This is to depict the inseparable unison 
of Universal puruSa, Male and
prakriti , Female, the seed and field.

[Commentary] While Valmiki Ramayana names Rama as Rama, the Padma Puraana etc., mythological 
texts bring in the Vedic texts and prefix shrii of
shrii-suukta of Rig Veda khila 5-87, which is a feminine 
counterpart of puruSa-suukta of Rig Veda 10-90, for
paramapuruSa i.e., Vishnu or Narayana, and thus call 
Rama of Valmiki as shrii raama. Vaishnavaite mythologies 
take hold of these and other Vedic references to Vishnu, and treat Vishnu / Narayana 
and Lakshmi as the inseparable divine couple, who maintain this Universe. The prefix
shrii means as 'one who takes delight in
shrii i.e., Lakshmi, meaning wealth, wealth of any 
kind. shriiriti prathamam naama lakshmyaaH  and ' if
a is the first name of Vishnu,
shrii is the first name of Lakshmi. Thus, primarily 
eight kinds of wealth are established, to be associated with Goddess Lakshmi. They 
are 1] aadi Lakshmi Wealth a priori 2]
dhaanya Lakshmi Cereal Wealth 3]
Dhairya Lakshmi Wealth of Courage 4]
gaja Laksmi Elephant Wealth, i.e., Elephantine Wealth 
of all animals and livestock, santaana Lakshmi Wealth 
of Progeny, 6] vijaya Lakshmi, Wealth of Victory, 7]
vidyaa Lakshmi Wealth of Education, 8]
dhana Lakshmi Monetary Wealth. And any thing that need 
be affluent gets the auspicious prefix shrii or suffix
lakshmi, and called raajya Lakshmi 
, Wealth of Empire, bhaagya lakshmi Wealth of Fortune, 
and the like...

[Commentary] The play of Goddess Lakshmi in the form of Seetha is Ramayana. As such, her absence 
from Rama caused Rama to travel up to Lanka, annihilate the evil, and retrieve her. 
Seetha herself expresses her anguish about Rama's indulgence in a Supreme welfare-state, 
than in herself, as Mahaakavi Kalidasa, in his epical poem Raghu Vamsha, and depicts 
what this bhaagya lakshmi has to say, when Rama, basing 
on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject, deserts Seetha in favour of
raajya lakshmi when Seetha said as below:

[Commentary] "Earlier you refused the kingdom-wealth, raajya lakshmi 
and came to forests, where I was with you. Now that, that kingdom-wealth,
raajya lakshmi on winning your affection is jealous 
of me, who am your bhaagya lakshmi 'fortune-wealth...' 
and she does not let me live in your palace." And thus, Seetha departs Rama to forests, 
at the fag end of Ramayana.

[Commentary] Valmiki declares Ramayana is siithaayaaH charitam mahaan... 
'Seetha's impeccable conduct...' by giving her an unusual birth from the furrow 
of the plough, and in the end she exits from this world into the same soil, where 
the earth is called vasundharaa, which cleaves under 
Seetha's feet, and takes Seetha into her womb again. As such, the reason for Seetha 
to be there in that furrow as baby is said to be a vow of Goddess Lakshmi, in her 
earlier incarnation as Vedavati. The mythologies go on to say that Vedavati is the 
brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati in marriage 
none less than Vishnu. But in his lifetime, it is an unfulfilled desire. Then Vedavati 
starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father's wish. When she is at her culmination 
point of her penance, Ravana, passing that way in sky sees this beautiful lady, 
nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation, curses Ravana 
saying that she will reincarnate herself, to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. 
Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. And Vedavati is reborn 
as Seetha of Ramayana, in an unusual way.

[Commentary] Here aananda-raamaayaNa has an interesting parable. 
Once there was a king named Padmaaksha who wanted Lakshmi as his daughter. On practising 
ascesis Vishnu appears and gives a fruit called maatulunga 
phala, and girl emerges from out of that fruit, and she is named as
Padma. But greedy to possess her, all the wooing kings 
war with Padmaaksha and his entire family is ruined and Padma jumps into fire and 
self immolates herself. Later when Vishnu's maayaa comes 
out of an altar of fire, sits in her meditation, Ravana sees her and wants to abduct 
her. Of course, she is otherwise said to be Vedavati in other texts. But again, 
she enters the fire altar and reduces herself to ashes. Even then, Ravana searches 
in those ashes for her. In there, he gets five diamonds of high quality. He comes 
to Lanka and paces those diamonds in a casket and jovially presents them to his 
wife Mandodari. When Mandodari could not lift the casket Ravana lifts it and opens 
its lid, as he lifted Mt. Kailash. When the casket is opened, Mandodari finds a 
baby girl in it and recognises her to be Goddess Lakshmi. Then they consult their 
teachers about that baby's arrival. Those teachers wishing good for Ravana, advise 
to get rid off this girl immediately, for he is Goddess Lakshmi, arrived here only 
to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders his servants to carry away 
this baby in a casket by an aircraft and get rid off it.

[Commentary] But Ravana rushes after the girl with a sword, to put that girl to sword. Empress 
Mandodari pacifies Ravana and says "Why purchase a later time death now itself at 
the hand of this baby... let that the casket be buried..." Ravana agrees. Mandodari 
also curses this girl saying, "this faithless girl, [for wealth 
is unfaithful,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses 
conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though 
wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole 
of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude..." Thus 
this casket is buried in the fields of King Janaka's empire by demons, clandestinely. 
Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal 
world, to foster this buried girl, and thus presumed her curse to be twisty. But 
there is King Janaka with all the above attributes. A king without ego, wealthy 
but living simple, childless, yet does not crave for one, like King Dasharatha. 
Hence, he is called raajarSi a saintly king. Seetha's 
birth is to be limitedly understood, as said by Janaka in this chapter. Otherwise, 
the nuances about the birth of Seetha are to be viewed through the viewfinders of 
mythologies, legends, and above all, through the viewfinders of tradition... but 
not in the vast of epical poetry, as Valmiki himself has undocumented it...



SARGA 67
------------------------------

[Text] Rama breaks Shiva's bow when he wanted to examine the tautness of its
          bowstring. Janaka is perplexed, while others swooned at the blast of breaking bow, and
          Janaka proposes Seetha to Rama in marriage. On the approval of Vishvamitra to that
          proposal, Janaka sends his plenipotentiaries to Ayodhya.

Shlok 1: On listening to the words of Janaka, the eminent-saint Vishvamitra indeed said to
  the king Janaka thus as, "let the bow be displayed to Rama..." [1-67-1]

Shlok 2: Then king Janaka indeed ordered his ministers, "bring the divine bow which is
  decorated with sandalwood paste and garlands... [1-67-2]

Shlok 3- 4: Thus clearly instructed by Janaka those high souled ministers have gone out from
  there and entered the palace-chambers, and they came out with an eight-wheeled coffer in which
  the bow of Shiva is ensconced, and those ministers got it tugged by five thousand tall men of
  illimitable energy who somehow tugged it very difficultly, and thus the ministers have re-entered
  there keeping that bow afore of them. [1-67-3, 4]

Shlok 5: On fetching that iron coffer wherein that bow is there, those ministers of the
  king have reported to their godlike King Janaka. [1-67-5]

Shlok 6: Oh king and sovereign of Mithila, here is the select bow that is reverenced by
  all kings, oh, best king, which you wished to be evincible to the boys, to evince their
  capabilities... [1-67-6]

Shlok 7: On listening the announcement of his ministers the king spoke to the noble souled
  Vishvamitra and to both Rama and Lakshmana too duly making palm-fold. [1-67-7]

Shlok 8: Here is that exquisite bow, oh, Brahman, which is held as a time-honoured bow by
  the lineage of Janaka kings, and with which even the highly forceful kings are rendered
  inefficient to take aim with it, previously... [1-67-8]

Shlok 9- 10: None in all the assemblages of gods, inclusive of demigods, demons, gandharva-s,
  yaksha-s, kinnaraa-s, or reptilian demigods, is capable enough to take aim with this bow and all
  are rendered incapable... and then, in brandishing this bow for a proper grip, or in bracing its
  bowstring to the other end, or in twitching the bowstring for its tautness, or in placing the
  arrow on bowstring at a proper place for a proper stretchability, or even in taking a good aim
  with it... what will be that capability of one from among humans... [1-1-9, 10]

Shlok 11: "Oh, eminent-saint, such as it is, this nonpareil bow among all bows is brought
  in, and oh, highly fortunate sage Vishvamitra, let this be displayed to those two princes..."
  Thus Janaka said to Vishvamitra. [1-67-11]

Shlok 12: Vishvamitra on listening the sentence of Janaka along with Rama, on his part said
  to Raghava, "oh, boy Rama... you may see the bow..." [1-67-12]

Shlok 13: Upon the word of the great sage Vishvamitra, Rama on unclosing the lid of that
  strongbox, wherein that bow is ensconced, saw the bow and said. [1-67-13]

Shlok 14: Now I wish to get the feel of this supreme bow, oh, Brahman, and I shall try to
  brandish it, or even try to take aim with it... [1-67-14]

Shlok 15: "All Right!" said the saint and king to Rama in chorus, and Rama upon the word of
  the sage grasping it at the middle handgrip playfully grabbed the bow. [1-67-15]

Shlok 16: While many thousands of men are witnessing that right-minded Rama the legatee of
  Raghu stringed the bow effortlessly. [1-67-16]

[Commentary] A bow has a definite height and it is a measure of length, from the ages even
  up to the age Kautilya, who gave many accounts for weights and measures, in his 'Artha Shaastra'
  a Penguin re-publication. Four aratni-s cubits are one dhanu, a bow-length,
  where one aratni is 18 inches, thus a bow-length is 6 feet and above, taking the
  standard size of archer as a six-footer and a little above. The bow's height is the height of the
  archer plus one measure of his head's height, as the upper end has to tower the archer's head.
  That being so, this bow belongs to Shiva and its height must be placed more than the human
  measure of 6 feet, and then it must be some 8 to 10 feet. And 'Rama is no crane-legged boy, as
  hisphysique is said to be of 'medium' size, and then how a boy of, say of 4, 41/2 feet, could
  catch the upper end of 8-10 feet bow to bend it...' is the objection. An archer has to stand the
  bow on ground, clutch its lower end under big toe, and with one hand, he has to bend it, while
  with the other he catches the bowstring to string the other end. He is not supposed to handle it
  like a holdall or a briefcase. For this objection it is said in a way that the poet is using the
  adjective mahaatmaa to Rama, ' an unfathomable one with an equally unfathomable soul...
  inasmuch as his duty is concerned...' The minute he touched the bow, it became a spongy stick and
  it listened to him and bent as he wished. Other way round, Rama is an ambidextrous archer and
  furthered is his skill by his possession of some divine missiles as given by Vishvamitra. Hence,
  his dexterity is now multiplied and he can handle any divine or human bow 'effortlessly...'

Shlok 17: Further, that dextrous one has stringed that bow with bowstring and started to
  stretch it up to his ear to examine its tautness, but that glorious one who is foremost among
  men, Rama, broke that bow medially. [1-67-17]

[Commentary] The bow is not broken by itself because of its oldness or dryness, but let us
  blame Rama for breaking it, as with any other toy which children are apt to damage in their
  playing. He stretched the bowstring so long until it broke. Neither his mother nor father
  available here. Otherwise, a 'moral class' would have chanced on him for braking articles in
  neighbour's houses. The bow is broken in the middle, not at either end, but at handgrip. This
  shows the strength of his palm on handgrip.

Shlok 18: Then there bechanced an explosive explosion when the bow is broken, like the
  explosiveness of down plunging thunder, and the earth is tremulously tremulous, as it happens
  when a mountain is exploding. [1-67-18]

[Commentary] We can write more words for the above sound as, 'Dhaam, Dhiim, Phut, and
  DiSkuu...' etc., as long as thesaurus permit. But all that will be nonsensical. An ear-splitting
  sound has come but it is "OM" the auspicious sonus prima grata, produced once upon a time by
  Shiva's drum, in order to emanate words through maaheshvara-suutraaNi, which were
  unintelligible even for the sages like Sanaka, Sananda, Sanat Kumaara et al., and which were
  deciphered by Nandi, the Holy Bull vehicle of Shiva, to those sages. Here it is Shiva's bow and
  name of Shiva and all letters that attaches to Him are shaM, sha.nkara, shaMbhava, are
  peace-making letters, as codified in AUM namaH
  shambhave ca mayo bhave ca namaH sha~Nkaraaya ca mayaskaraaya ca namaH shivaaya ca shivataraaya
  ca | - rudram - soma suukta - yajur  Hence the real sound of Om is
  audible and it is ear-splitting for ordinary audience, since ordinary people cannot possibly face
  realities, and it is a regularly audible sound for the other four who have not swooned. By the
  way, it will be impossible for us to listen the chanting of Veda-s, even in these days, in any
  Vedic school for at least half an hour, as our ears are untuned to their ghana paaTha or
  jaTa or other sorts of chanting. We feel stranded in some audio studio with fully loaded
  sound FX.

[Commentary] And the pacemaker Rama lifted the bow of the peacemaker Shiva, where the bow
  itself is "Om". The legendary Indian bow is composed of three parts, unlike Robin Hood's
  single-piece bow. The lower bowing part, upper bowing part combined by a grip handle, and the
  bowstring. The three pieces are comparable to the three letters syllabified "Om" - a u
  ma, where a is upper bowing piece of bow, u, the lower end, and
  ma, the bowstring. The painters usually paint this bow-breaking scene, where Rama will
  be still handling the upper end in his hand, while the lower part will be falling, and the
  bowstring will be still dangling onto the upper end. The upper part of bow is a and this
  a is Vishnu akaaraartho viSNuH, and the dangling bowstring is ma
  Goddess Lakshmi, lokamaataa maa ramaa mangaladevataa, dangling on the Supreme Person
  through thick and thin, and the detached-un-detached lower end is u, Lakshmana, or any
  other adherer. A lengthy account of this trilogy is provided in Aranya Kanda, Ch. 19, first
  verse.

[Commentary] And the pacemaker Rama is marrying the world with peace, by stringing the
  bowstring of peacemaker's bow, and it is not a mere marriage of some prince charming, with a
  charmy princess. Thus, this sound is the initial impact, impetus, brunt, or whatever, for
  universal peace, and that way this marriage attains a legendary significance in peace process,
  though by force.

Shlok 19: Bewildered by that raucous caused by the breakage of bow, all the people swooned,
  except for that eminent-saint Vishvamitra, king Janaka, and those two Raghava-s, namely Rama and
  Lakshmana. [1-67-19]

Shlok 20: While the people are being reaccustomed after their undergoing the shock, at that
  moment that sententious king Janaka, whose discomfiture has completely departed by now has said
  this to the eminent-saint Vishvamitra with a reverent palm-fold. [1-67-20]

Shlok 21: Oh, godly sage, the gallantry of Dasharatha's Rama is evidently seen... and the
  whys of this boy and wherefores of his stringing that massive bow are unimaginable to me! More
  so, humans lifting it! How so? This is an unhoped-for incident for me, besides, breaking it! This
  a is highly wondrous experience for me... [1-67-21]

Shlok 22: My daughter Seetha on getting Dasharatha's Rama as her husband, she will bring
  celebrity to the lineage of Janaka-s... [1-67-22]

[Commentary] This verse explains the advantageous status of Seetha than Rama in her birth
  and brought up. mama sutaa 'my daughter...' though I have not given her a physical
  birth, she is godsend to me, and I brought her up as a rarest of rare daughter with all the
  endowments of Janaka-s lineage which are impeccable... hence she is more than my physical
  daughter...' siitaa 'a furrow... born a furrow, an unusual non-uterine birth than the
  uterine birth of Rama from his mother Kausalya... hence Seetha has a plus point... dasharathaatmajam
   'Dasharatha's son...' a wooable bridegroom... because he is Rama ramayate iti
  raama 'makes others delightful...' besides this, the saying about an eligible bridegroom is
  there:  kanyaa varayate
  ruupam maataa vittam pitaa shrutam baandhavaaH shiilam icchanti suupaannam itare
  janaaH   'a bride cherishes charming mien, a prince-charming, rather... mother
  of the bridegroom wishes to have money through him... bridegroom's father wants him to be a wise one
  in dealings with his new wife and old parents... and bridegroom's relatives require of him good
  demeanour... and other people wish to have dough of cooked pulse-gram, marriage-feasts,
  rather...' so also my daughter will cherish this boy as his looks are like that of a
  prince-charming... and the money for his mother, scholarly attitude to his father, good demeanour
  and feasts etc., to friends and relatives, all he can afford... and on aasaadya reaching
  Rama... my daughter brings kiirti 'celebrity' to our lineage, which is in singularly
  unique... because kiirti is said in singular number, it will be singularly unique...
  hence let this boy not negate my proposal as my daughter has many plus points...'

Shlok 23: Oh, Kaushika, my commitment that she is the bounty of bravery has also come
  true... and my daughter Seetha who is nurtured well than my own lives is a worthy bride for
  Rama... [1-67-23]

Shlok 24: Should you give consent, oh, Brahman, my ministers will be hastened to speedily
  go to Ayodhya in chariots, oh, Kaushika, let safeness betide you, and one and all by this
  matrimony... [1-67-24]

[Commentary] Annex: 'This boy appears to be straight from the shoulder type, and he may now
  say boyishly, 'no, no, I just wanted to see and feel the bow, but that poor old bow is broken in
  my hand, but I have never said that I will marry your daughter without the consent of my
  father... and I am supposed to marry whomever my father ties down my neck...' knowing him to be
  such, I want to send proposals to Dasharatha at Ayodhya, that too if you say yes...'

Shlok 25: With their observant submissions those ministers will narrate in detail about the
  sincere endowment of Seetha as bravery's bounty to Rama, and they will lead king Dasharatha into
  my city that observantly... [1-67-25]

Shlok 26: "Those ministers will also tell the king Dasharatha that both the Kakutstha-s,
  Rama and Lakshmana, are under the aegis of saint Vishvamitra, and thus gladdening that king they
  will expeditiously usher in king Dasharatha for marriage..." So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.
  [1-67-26]

Shlok 27: Vishvamitra said, "so be it," and then that right-minded king Janaka on consulting
  with his ministers started to send his ministers, plenipotentiaries, to Ayodhya to inform
  Dasharatha in detail as to what has happened, and likewise to bring him to Mithila. [1-67-27]



SARGA 68
------------------------------

[Text] Janaka's delegation arrives at Ayodhya and submits its message to Dasharatha. Listening 
to the tidings that his son Rama not only lifted the bow of Shiva, but broke it 
as well, Dasharatha is overjoyed and refers the matter of marriage of Seetha with 
Rama to his ministers and teachers. All of the ministers and sages unanimously agree 
to that proposal and they are set to travel to Mithila the next day.

Shlok 1: Those envoys who are clearly ordered by Janaka entered the city of Ayodhya on sojourning 
for three nights en route, and whose horses are overtired for they are galloped 
so fast to loose no time. [1-68-1]

Shlok 2: On going to the palace those envoys are given an audience with the consent of Dasharatha, 
and when they are conducted into the palace-chambers they have seen the elderly 
king Dasharatha gleaming like a god. [1-68-2]

Shlok 3: Completely gone is the angst of all the legates on seeing godly Dasharatha, and 
all of them adjoing palms in reverence said this compliant and mellowly worded sentence 
to the king. [1-68-3]

[Commentary] Because Dasharatha is caught in the tomfoolery of Kaikeyi he cannot be estimated 
as an inane personality. It is their domestic cold war. He is famous for his achievements 
and he fought wars on behalf of no lesser gods. Though Valmiki does not narrate 
Dasharatha's exploits, other scripts say a lot about them. Hence, whenever Rama's 
daring, dashing, swashbuckling is to be pictured, he will be indicated as 'Dasharatha's 
son...' That is the reason why the angst of envoys is said in this verse as 'vanished' 
just by a glimpse of that godly personality, which hitherto haunted them as to how 
to countenance such a powerful personality.

Shlok 4- 5: Oh, exalted emperor Dasharatha! Janaka, the lineal king of Janaka-s and the present 
sovereign of Mithila is asking time and time again with mellowly words instilled 
with friendliness, after the wellbeing and after the unmitigated prosperity of your 
highness, along with that of your highness' priests and teachers, also that of your 
highness' subjects, who always precede your highness in convoys in any event, as 
your highness are the one who ingratiates himself with the Ritual-fires, ever and 
anon... [1-68-4, 5]

Shlok 6: His highness Janaka of Videha, and the sovereign of Mithila, having asked after 
your highness' wellbeing is sensibly saying this word to your highness, with the 
indorse of Kaushika... [1-68-6]

Shlok 7: Well-known is the solemn promise of mine that my daughter Seetha is a bounty 
for bravery... also well-know is that the kings who came to lift the bow turned 
out as gutless kings, and then they turned out as rancorous kings at me, and it 
is also well-known that I turned them back with my guts... [1-68-7]

Shlok 8: Oh, Emperor Dasharatha, your young and valorous son who serendipitously arrived 
at Mithila along with his younger brother Lakshmana, keeping Vishvamitra at his 
fore, finally carries off this girl, the well-known daughter of mine... [1-68-8]

[Commentary] Usually this verse gives meaning that 'two of your valorous sons won Seetha...' 
because of the usage of plural number viiraiH putrakaiH But this is counted 
as 'royal we' sort of expression to honour Rama. Hence this ka-pratyaya, 
though used in the verse, will be read as singular. There is another shade of wording 
for this verse: seyam mama sutaa raajan vishvaamitrasya shaashanaat | puriim imaam samaagatya 
tava pureNa nirjitaa || which uses only singular for Rama.

Shlok 9: Also, oh, highly dextrous king Dasharatha, noble souled Rama wrecked that divine 
bow, which is a gem of a bow among bows, at its central point before a grand assembly 
of people... [1-68-9]

Shlok 10: Seetha is the bounty for bravery and I shall have to afford her to the noble-souled 
Rama, as such it will be apt of you to give your consent as I wish to keep up my 
solemn promise... [1-68-10]

Shlok 11: Keeping your royal priest Vashishta and other teachers ahead of you, oh, great 
emperor, I wish you to come apace, let safe betide you, for it will be apt of you 
to take a look at your ennobled son Rama, and Lakshmana, too... [1-68-11]

Shlok 12: 'It will be apt of you to make my solemn promise maintainable, and that way you 
will derive delight on seeing both of your sons...' [1-68-12]

[Commentary] 'by the by, you will also derive delight in seeing Seetha, for she is also a hyphenated 
daughter of yours, sutashcha sutaa ca tayoH ekasheSaH... with another suffix, 
in-law...'

Shlok 13: "Thus the sovereign of Videha kingdom said these endearing words, abiding by the 
counsel of Sage Shataananda, and Sage Vishvamitra is also consentient to the proposal..." 
Thus the envoys conveyed the proposal and paused. [1-68-13]

Shlok 14: King Dasharatha is highly gladdened on hearing that message from the delegates, 
and said this way to Vashishta, Vaamadeva, and to his other ministers, as well. 
[1-68-14]

Shlok 15: This one Rama, the enhancer of Kausalya's rejoice, is stopping over at Videha kingdom 
along with his brother Lakshmana, and Vishvamitra is taking care of both these boys... 
[1-68-15]

Shlok 16: On observing the valour of Kakutstha Rama, noble souled Janaka wishes to gift his 
daughter as bride to Raghava Rama... [1-68-16]

Shlok 17: "If you all favour the tidings from the noble-souled Janaka as to what has happened 
in Mithila, we quickly proceed to that city, let not the time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha 
informed his counsel. [1-68-17]

[Commentary] The word vR^ittam 'happening' 'history' and it is generally translated 
as 'the history, legend, and the familial characteristics of Janaka...' But when 
Janaka already is famous through the bow of Shiva, and that bow itself is broken 
now, no more 'verification of antecedents' of Janaka is needed, and it is 'what 
has happened now' i.e., the impossible deed of breaking it.

Shlok 18: The ministers along with all of the great sages said in consonance, "Most Welcome..." 
and then that highly pleased king Dasharatha said to the ministers, "we travel tomorrow..." 
[1-68-18]

Shlok 19: The ministers of king Janaka who are gifted with all talents are given grateful 
hospitality by Dasharatha, and they all dwelt that night in Ayodhya, overjoyed at 
the successful completion of their august legatine, called 
sIta kalyANam...  [1-68-19]



SARGA 69
------------------------------

[Text] Dasharatha arrives at Mithila and Janaka receives him reverentially, as he belongs 
to a crowning dynasty, called Ikshvaku-s. Then, after the usual exchange of royal 
pleasantries and protocol, all of them stay in Mithila comfortably.

Shlok 1: On the next dawn that heartened king Dasharatha who is with his teachers and his 
relatives then said this to his minister Sumantra. [1-69-1]

Shlok 2: Now let the chancellors of exchequers draw ample riches, gems and numerous other 
items that are used in the marriage from bridegroom's side, all-inclusively, and 
let them travel in advance and let them be well-prepared for any exigency... [1-69-2]

Shlok 3: Let the quadruple forces start off in a trice from everywhere at my order, and 
others shall start with unexcelled vehicles like palanquins, sedan chairs, litters 
etc., and with those that can be yoked with horses, like cabined-coaches and horse-carriages... 
[1-69-3]

[Commentary] The fourfold army is generally taken as horses, elephants, chariots, and foot 
soldiers for the word caturanga-balam , while some say such an army is 
moved only when a massive combat is necessary, but not when going to marriages. 
Thus some say though army is moved, it is as much as required. But this word also 
qualifies as caturanga-balam= dhana, kanaka, vastu, vaahana sampatti, the 
quadruple opulence, namely 'riches, gold, equipage, and vehicles...' where opulence 
will be the only show in Indian marriages, either of poor or rich. R. C. Dutt comes 
near to this when telling in his poetic version: 'Ride in front with royal riches, 
gold and gems in bright array

Shlok 4- 5: "Vashishta, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali and Kaashyapa, and the long-lived Maarkandeya, and 
Sage Kaatyaayana... let these Brahmans travel in forefront... and let horses be 
yoked to my royal-cariole, and as the messengers of Janaka are hastening me arrange 
for the travel without time lapse..." Thus Dasharatha ordered. [1-69-4, 5]

Shlok 6: On the word of that best king the fourfold opulence, and even the fourfold forces 
up to some extent followed rearward of the king who is going after the sages who 
are going afore of him. [1-69-6]

Shlok 7: Travelling on a four-day-route Dasharatha reached the fringes of Videha kingdom, 
and on hearing this, the illustrious king Janaka arranged for welcome ceremonies 
at the outskirts of the city. [1-69-7]

[Commentary] These formalities are still prevalent in marriage functions, in one way or the other, 
in India, esp. rural India. The bridegroom's party will be received at the outskirts 
of the bride's place, esp. if it were to be a village, then a small function / ceremony 
will be held laudatory to the bridegroom, and then they are invited into that place 
of bride like, 'meet a party halfway...' type protocol. This is other than baraat 
'matrimonial pageantry...'

Shlok 8: Then the king Janaka who is by far gladdened went into a state of ecstatic elation 
when he met the senescent king and paladin of people, namely Dasharatha, as the 
pace for the marriage celebrations is quickened because of the immediate arrival 
of Dasharatha. [1-69-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: And the best one among men, king Janaka, gleefully said this commendable sentence 
to Dasharatha, the best legatee of Raghu, "oh, king, a hearty welcome to you. Oh, 
legatee of Raghu, your arrival to my city is just by my providence... you will now 
get delectation on seeing your sons who won accolades just by their valorousness 
in the act of raising and breaking Shiva's bow..." [1-69-9, 10a]

[Commentary] Though Rama alone broke the bow of Shiva, both Rama and Lakshmana are said to have 
done it. This is a common unified laudation used for both of them, in view of their 
insuperable brotherhood, and such a sort of commingling both, for one person's action, 
can be heard often. For e.g., when Lakshmana misshapes Shuurpanakha, Rama is said 
to have done, and even both are said to have done that act.

Shlok 10b- 11a: Providentially bechanced is the arrival of this great-resplendent and godly sage 
Vashishta, who arrived here with all of these eminent Brahmans, like Indra himself 
with all gods... [1-69-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: Providentially my hindrances are overcome by the arrival of godlike sages, and 
providentially my lineage too is gloried owing to this hymeneal engagement with 
noble-souled Raghava-s, who are the most valorous among all the valorous people... 
[1-69-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13b: Because you are born in first and foremost Ikshvaku dynasty, hence you are the 
Indra of Indra-like kings on earth... and hence, it will be apt of you to initiate 
the celebrations of marriage tomorrow, and the marriage itself after the culmination 
of the Vedic-ritual in three or four days, and the date and time for the marriage, 
that which is agreeable to the best sages can be decided, and you can get it performed 
on that date, through those great sages... [1-69-12b, 13a]

[Commentary] There is controversy about the marriage of Seetha with Rama, insofar as its categorisation. 
Whether it is one of the eight kinds or not, is a debated point. The eight kinds 
of marriages are braahma, daiva, praajaapatya, aarSa, aasura, gaandharva, raakshasa, 
paishaaca and this topic can be discussed at a later time.

Shlok 13b- 14a: On hearing that sentence of king Janaka the sententious king Dasharatha replied 
the king Janaka from amongst the sages. [1-69-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: "Recipiency rests with the restitutor..." so I have heard earlier. Hence, whatever 
you say, for you are the knower of probity and nothing goes amiss in your astute 
thinking, that we will do... [1-69-14b, 15a]

[Commentary] The word restitutor is used instead of 'donor' because Janaka is restoring the estranged 
divine pair to their togetherness in this mortal world. R. C. Dutt uses 'Gift betokens 
giver's bounty...' for this expression.

Shlok 15b- 16a: On listening that sentence of that affirmer of principles, namely Dasharatha, that 
which is conformable to the principles of marriages and familial glory, a thrill 
of joy came over the king of Videha. [1-69-15b. 16a]

[Commentary] Usually the bridegroom's party will be stiff-necked at least till the marriage is 
over, which has become a nuisance practice in Indian marriages. Here Dasharatha 
is telling the opposite, by which his words are viewed as agreeable to righteousness 
of marriages etc., and for which Janaka is surprised.

Shlok 16b- 17a: Then, on the foregathering of sages from Vashishta's side with the sages of Mithila 
all the sages have attained extreme joy and they spent that night happily. [1-69-16b, 
17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: Then that most brilliant Rama, keeping Vishvamitra ahead, and strutting in step 
with Lakshmana, strutted to touch the feet of his father Dasharatha. [1-69-17]

Shlok 18b-19a: On seeing his two sons, the super medallists in Raghu's dynasty, King Dasharatha 
is highly rejoiced and he resided in Mithila with a high contentment, for the reverence 
of Janaka is that high. [1-69-18]

[Commentary] The expression of 'medallists' to the word Raghava-s as above will look 
odd. So an explanation to this is furnished in the endnote.

Shlok 19: Even the great-resplendent Janaka on performing ritual acts according to scriptures 
for the Vedic-ritual on hand, and the preparatory rituals for handing out both of 
his daughters in marriage, went into the sleep of the just, with his palm on his 
chest. [1-69-19]

[Commentary] The marriages will be commenced with initial ceremonies called ankuraaropaNa- 
aadi kriyaaH for an unhindered marriage function and for the harmonious family 
life of the newly wed.



SARGA 70
------------------------------

[Text] Ikshvaku's bloodline is narrated as custom demands to enquire into the bridegroom's lineage. Vashishta narrates this to 
 other Kushadhvaja, who is also summoned to participate in the wedding celebrations, and who later has to 
offer his two daughters to Bharata and Shatrughna. This listing and eulogising ancestors is an adjunctive custom in Indian 
marriages. Nowadays it is limited to cite only three preceding generations, instead of narrating from the first, since nobody 
holds his family tree, ready at hand.

Shlok 1: Then on the next day morning after getting the ritual liturgies performed through sages, he that articulator Janaka articulated 
this to sage Shataananda, the royal priest. [1-70-1]

Shlok 2- 3: My younger brother renowned thus as Kushadhvaja, a highly self-righteous one and a highly brilliant one is ruling from 
the auspicious and holy city named Saankaasya, which city is surrounded by River Ikshumati as a natural moat, in which moat 
bastions of tridents are staked all around... and my brother presides over that city as if he is sitting in the Pushpaka 
aircraft of richly-rich god Kubera, and as though supping the sugarcane juice-like waters of River Ikshumati... [1-70-2, 
3]

[Commentary] The words vaaryaa phalakaparyantaam also mean 'that city is surrounded by the plantation of citrus grapefruits 
that are famous for health keeping.

Shlok 4: "And I wish to see him, as he is the nominated benefactor of this Vedic-ritual of mine, and he too shall become a rejoicer 
in partaking the joyousness of this marriage... " So said Janaka to Shataananda. [1-70-4]

[Commentary] Kushadhvaja supplied whole lot of paraphernalia for this Vedic-ritual of Janaka from his auspicious city Saankaasya, and 
hence he is the benefactor of the ritual.

Shlok 5: That way when Janaka asseverated that enunciation in the presence of Shataananda, Shataananda in turn ordered and summoned 
envoys, and then some alacritous envoys have come, whom Janaka ordered to proceed to his brother. [1-70-5]

Shlok 6: By the order of the king those envoys who have speedy horses have travelled on to city Saankaasya speedily, to lead forth 
that tigerly man Kushadhvaja that speedily, which is as good as fetching Vishnu by order of Indra. [1-70-6]

Shlok 7: On arriving in city Saankaasya those envoys have seen king Kushadhvaja and on submitting what has happened to the king about 
Rama's breaking of Shiva's bow, and they have also submitted the point of view of Janaka regarding marriages of four daughters. 
[1-70-7]

[Commentary] The viewpoint of Janaka is to offset the problem of marriages of both the daughters of his brother Kushadhvaja. Dasharatha 
has four sons and Janaka presaged a quadruple alliance with him, where Janaka has two daughters and his brother Kushadhvaja 
has two.

Shlok 8: On hearing that event from the worthy envoys whose speed is praiseworthy, king Kushadhvaja came right away to Mithila by 
the order of king Janaka. [1-70-8]

Shlok 9- 10a: Kushadhvaja addressed himself to the insightful one and a compassionate person in the duty of an elder brother, namely Janaka, 
and on reverencing sage Shataananda firstly, next he has reverenced his fondly affectionate brother Janaka, and then he 
sat upon a majestic seat, that which is befitting to kings. [1-70-9, 10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: Both the brothers of unlimited self-refulgence having assumed their high seats, they who are distinguished for their righteous 
acts have started to send Sudaamana, the distinguished minister. [1-70-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: "Oh, minister plenipotentiary, Sudaamana, you please proceed immediately to king Dasharatha, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s with 
illimitable resplendence, and let that invincible king Dasharatha be led hither along with his sons and along with his Vedic-celebrants..." 
Thus Janaka ordered Sudaamana, the minister. [1-70-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: Accordingly Sudaamana has gone to the visitatorial-palace of the promoter of Raghu's heritage, namely Dasharatha, and he 
said this on appearing before that king duly bowing down and hailing the king. [1-70-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b-14a: "Oh, valiant king, oh, sovereign of Ayodhya, his highness the sovereign of Mithila from the heritage of Videha kings is 
poised for seeking an audience with your highness, along with your highness' royal-priest Vashishta and other mentors..." 
The minister Sudaamana said so to Dasharatha. [1-70-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: On hearing that best minister's words, then king Dasharatha came to the place where Janaka is available, along with his 
kinsmen and the assemblages of sages. [1-70-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: That sententious king Dasharatha said this to the king from the lineage of Videha kings, Janaka, who is with his mentors, 
kinsfolk, and ministers. [1-70-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b-17a: "Oh, exalted king Janaka, you already appreciate that this godly sage Vashishta is godlike to the bloodline of Ikshvaku-s, 
and in all affairs he is our internuncio... [1-70-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18- 19a: "Should an assent be given by Sage Vishvamitra, along with all the great sages present here, this equanimous Vashishta will 
narrate about my bloodline, lineally..." And, to the nod of Vishvamitra Dasharatha become reticent, and then the godly and 
sententious sage Vashishta who is along with his men of the cloth said these sentences to the king of Videha, namely Janaka. 
[1-70-17b, 18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20: The Unprovable emanated the timeless, changeless and perishless Brahma, and from that Being, namely Brahma, Mariichi is 
begotten, and Kaashyapa is the son of Mariichi, and the Sun is begotten from Kaashyapa, and Manu is said to be the son of 
the Sun... [1-70-19b, 20]

[Commentary] The avyakta is the 'Unmanifest' of advaita tenet. Here it an 'Unprovable' 
entity since it cannot be proved by pramaaNa-s 'source of knowledge' like
pratyakSha, anumaana, tarka, aagama... 'perception, inference, logic, scriptures...' and because 
Vishnu cannot be deduced by these sources of knowledge, Vishnu Himself becomes the avyakta. 
And from the viewpoint of mythology, Ramayana has no place for a 'featureless Absolute...' nirguNa- 
brahma of advaita, because Valmiki's initial questions to Narada include
ko guNavaan, and thus He is saguNa-brahma. Hence
avyakta or aakaasha, 'minus leeway...' all-pervading...' 
is Vishnu, the 'Unprovable'.

[Commentary] This aakaasha is the often repeated expression in Upanishad-s, telling it to be the
aatma, Absolute, abiding in each individual jiivaatma, Individual 
Soul. aakaasho hi vai naamaruupayoH nirvaahitaaH te yad antaram tad brahma tad amR^itam sa aatmaa - chaandogya - 8-14 
| ko he vaaNyatkaH praaNaat ya eSha aakaasha aanando na syaat - taittariiya - 7 anuvaaka | aakaashorarthaantaratvaadivyapadeshaat 
- 1-3-41 | daharottarebhyaH - 1-3-14 - brahma-suutra ;'who is he to be able to balance himself if this
aakaasha is not to be there...' Taittarriya; 'that which makes the names and forms is within 
you alone as your innermost inner-space, that alone is deathless...' Chaandogya; 'akaasha [is Absolute] because it is proclaimed 
to be something different etc., [from names and forms yet their revealer...]; 'the small [aakaasha] is Absolute because 
of subsequent texts [which give ample evidence of it...] Brahma-Sutra. Hence, it is Vishnu.

[Commentary] Out of the three epithets to Brahma one is 'timeless' because He continues to be in two paraartha-s, 
say 31, 10, 40, 00, 00, 00, 000 human years, without transmutation, yet He continues further. He is 'changeless' as his 
faculties or His divine being does not undergo any mutation or metamorphosis. He is 'perishless' during the above period 
and after, since Vishnu gave rise to Him. Up to here is ultramundane order of progeny and the mundane lineage is now continued.

Shlok 21: Manu is the earliest Prajaapati and Ikshvaaku is the son of Manu, and that Ikshvaaku is the first king of Ayodhya... know 
thus... [1-70-21]

Shlok 22: The son of Ikshvaaku is the legendary Kukshi, thus he is renowned, and the famous Vikukshi is the son of Kukshi... 
[1-70-22]

Shlok 23: From that most brilliant and courageous Vikukshi, Baana emerged as son, and the highly refulgent and valinat Anaranya is 
the son of Baana... [1-70-23]

Shlok 24: Pruthu is the son of Anaranya, and Trishanku is Pruthu's son, and the highly renowned Dhundumaara happened to be the son 
of Trishanku... [1-70-24]

Shlok 25: Dhundumaara begot a highly glorious and a speediest charioteer Yuvanaashva as son, and Mandhaata emerged as the son of 
Yuvanaashva... [1-70-25]

Shlok 26: Maandhaata engendered the highly noble Susandhi as son, and even Susandhi engendered two sons, namely Dhruvasandhi and 
Prasenajit... [1-70-26]

Shlok 27: From Dhruvasandhi, an illustrious one named as Bharata is begotten, and Bharata begot a highly effulgent son named as Asita... 
[1-70-27]

Shlok 28: To which Asita, kings like Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant Shashabindu-s have become adversaries and kings in 
hostility, he had to wage war with them... [1-70-28]

Shlok 29: While counterattacking those kings, Asita is dethroned in war and then he reached Himalayas along with his two wives... 
[1-70-29]

Shlok 30- 31a: Asita was with his meagre forces when he was in Himalayas, and there he drew nigh of his Time. At the time of his demise 
two of his wives were pregnant, and one of two wives gave toxic food to the co-wife for abortion... thus we heard... [1-70-30-31a]

Shlok 31b-32a: There was a saint named Cyavana, the heir of Sage Bhrigu, who in fascination with best and beautiful mountains then taking 
shelter on Himalayas. [1-70-31b, 32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: One of the two wives of Asita, the lotus-petal eyed and highly fortunate one queen came there desirous of a best son, and 
reverenced the sage who is godly in his glow... [1-70-32b-33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: Another queen Kaalindi who administer food poison to her co-wife has also come to the sage, and she too reverenced him. 
That sage spoke to her who received poison from her co-wife regarding the birth of her son. [1-70-34]

[Commentary] There are variations in reading these lines. While some say that Kaalindi is one who 'gave' toxic food to her sister, while 
some others say that Kaalindi is the one who 'received' the poisoned food. Here taking the kaalindi ca 'Kaalindi 
also...' it is said that 'Kaalindi is she who has administered poison...' Since she is also pregnant, coupled with the guilt 
of poisoning, hence the use of ca , she too came to the sage.

Shlok 34b- 35: 'Oh, highly fortunate lady, a very good son and a very mighty son is there in your womb. Soon you will give birth to a 
highly vigorous, highly refulgent son and that illustrious one will take birth with toxicity, but there is no need to worry...' 
So said Sage Cyavana to the queen of Asita who received the poison. [1-70-35]

Shlok 36: On reverencing Sage Cyavana that husband devout princess whose husband is no more that lady gave birth to a son... [1-70-36]

Shlok 37: "Because he took birth along with the poison administered to his mother by her co-wife, he became Sagara, the emperor..." 
[1-70-37]

[Commentary] Parable: When king Asita passed away his queen and this Sagara's mother wanted to commit self-immolation, but this Sage 
Cyavana dissuades her from it because she is pregnant, and takes her to his hermitage. When she gave birth to Sagara, Sage 
Cyavana rears up Sagara and teaches him all of the archery by according aagneyaastra Fire-missile etc., kingcraft, 
and scriptures. On one occasion when Sagara asks for the details about his father, Cyavana had to tell all the legend of 
Asita and his conflicts with yavana-s, and shaka-s. Sagara becoming furious at Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant 
Shashabindu-s, wars with them and drives them out of this country. While doing so, Sagara makes yavana-s tonsured,
shaka-s or so-called Scythians, as half-tonsured, and paarada-s as shaggy haired ones, thus stripping 
of their Kshatriya-hood. Taking the nearness of name paarada to Persia, it is said that the kings repulsed by Sagara 
taken domicile in the Middle East and a aaryan or a aa riaan is Airan or present day Iran, and 
age-old are Indo-Iranian links. Further, the word Asia has its own nearness to the name of king Asita.

Shlok 38: From Sagara it is Asamanja and from Asamanja it is Amshuman, and from Amshuman it is Diliipa, and the son of Diliipa is 
Bhageeratha... [1-70-38]

Shlok 39- 40a: From Bhageeratha it is Kakutstha, from Kakutstha it is Raghu, and Raghu's son is the great resplendent Pravriddha, who 
is reduced to a human flesh eater, and he is also known as Kalmaashapaada... and from him, that Pravriddha, Shankana is born... 
[1-70-39, 40a]

[Commentary] This Pravriddha is really a great king in this lineage, but somewhat arrogant. So, at one time he was subjected to the fury 
of Vashishta and becomes a man-eating demon. But he too got his mystic powers. When he was trying to issue a counter-curse 
to Vashishta, by taking water into his hand, his wife Madayanti, being a husband devout wife dissuades him to not to counter 
all-powerful Vashishta. He on listening to his wife drops that water taken for cursing, onto his own feet. Then his accursed 
water blemished him via his feet. Hence, he is also termed as Kalmashapaada.

Shlok 40b- 41: Shankana's son is Sudarshana, and from Sudarshana it is Agnivarsna... And Shiigraga is the son of Agnivarsna, and Shiighraga's 
son is Maru and from Maru it is Prashushruka, and Ambariisha is the son of Prashushruka... [1-70-41]

Shlok 42: Ambariisha's son was Nahusha, the emperor and Yayaati is the son of Nahusha, but Naabhaaga is born to Yayaati... [1-70-42]

[Commentary] These names Nahusha and Yayaati also occur in other Puraana-s, indicating them in earlier eras to Ramayana period.

Shlok 43: Aja was Naabhaaga's son and from Aja, this Dasharatha is manifest, and from him, from this Dasharatha, these brothers, 
Rama and Lakshmana are born... [1-70-43]

Shlok 44- 45: "Oh, best one among men, Janaka, from the beginning this bloodline of Ikshvaaku-s is spotlessly immaculate, immensely impeccable, 
indomitable, and irreproachable, and in respect of these kings born in this line of blood, oh, king Janaka, I espouse that 
it will be meetly of you to offer your seemly daughters to this seemly pair of Rama and Lakshmana..." So said Vashishta 
to king Janaka. [1-70-44, 45]



SARGA 71
------------------------------

[Text] Janaka narrates his lineage while offering his daughters as brides to Rama and Lakshmana. In doing so, he elaborates 
			more about his brother Kushadhvaja, whose daughters are the would-be-wives of Bharata and Shatrughna. They even 
			fix the timings for marriage.

Shlok 1: When sage Vashishta said that way, Janaka reverentially made palm fold and said this in reply, "oh, sage, let safeness betide 
you all... now, it will be apt of you all to listen to our distinguished lineage..." [1-71-1]

Shlok 2: "Oh, eminent sage Vashishta, he who is born in a particular noble gens has to inform about his parentage in its entirety, 
especially when he offers a bride... thereby oh, great sage, let all be informed of about our lineage..." [1-71-2]

Shlok 3: Once there was an emperor Nimi, who was renowned in the triad of worlds by his own accomplishments, and who was uniquely 
seraphic-souled and a best one among all stalwart emperors... [1-71-3]

Shlok 4: And his son was named as Mithi, and Janaka was Mithi's son... the first one to be designated as Janaka... and even from 
that Janaka it is Udaavasu who took birth... [1-71-4]

Shlok 5: From Udaavasu it is noble souled Nandivardhana took birth, and Nandivardhana's son is named as Suketu, by his name... [1-71-5]

Shlok 6: From Suketu the highly powerful and virtue-souled Devaraata is born, and from that kingly sage Devaraata, it is Brihadratha 
who took birth, thus we have heard... [1-71-6]

Shlok 7: From Brihadratha it is the highly braving, courageous and valiant Mahaaviira has come, and the bold and truth-valiant Sudhriti 
from Mahaaviira... [1-71-7]

Shlok 8: Form Sudhriti, the right-minded and highly generous Dhristaketu took birth, and from the kingly sage Dhristaketu it is 
highly renowned Haryashva is the son... [1-71-8]

Shlok 9: Haryashva's son is Maru, and Maru's, son is Pratiindhaka, and the son of Pratiindhaka's is noble-souled king Kiirtiratha... 
[1-71-9]

Shlok 10: The son of Kiirtiratha is remembered as Devamiidha, and the son of Devamiidha is Vibudha, and Vibudha's son is Mahiidraka... 
[1-71-10]

Shlok 11: Mahiidraka's son is the great mighty king Kiirtiraata, and the son born to sagely king Kiirtiraata is Mahaaroma... [1-71-11]

Shlok 12: From Mahaaroma it is the virtue-souled Swarnaroma, and from kingly sage Swarnaroma it is Hrasvaroma... [1-71-12]

Shlok 13: Two sons are born to that knower of virtue and noble souled Hrasvaroma, I am the elder, and my younger brother is this 
brave Kushadhvaja... [1-71-13]

Shlok 14: He that king and father of ours, Hrasvaroma, anointing me in kingdom as I am the elder, and vesting the duty of looking 
after Kushadhvaja in me, he departed to forests... [1-71-14]

Shlok 15: On the departure of our aged father to heaven, I am looking after this godlike Kushadhvaja with brotherliness and lugging 
around the burden of this kingship... [1-71-15]

Shlok 16: Then after sometime, a valorous king named Sudhanva came beleaguering Mithila, from his city Saamkaasha... [1-71-16]

Shlok 17: 'The unexcelled bow of Shiva shall be given to me, along with the lotus-eyed virgin, Seetha...' thus he started to urge 
me... [1-71-17]

Shlok 18: "Oh, Brahma sage Vashishta, for the reason of my non-bestowal of bow or bride he warred with me, and when he affronted me 
in that war I have put that Sudhanva to the sword..." [1-71-18]

Shlok 19: Oh, best sage Vashishta, on eliminating king Sudhanva, I have anointed my valiant brother Kushadhvaja in the kingdom of 
Saamkaasha... [1-71-19]

Shlok 20- 21a: Oh, best saint Vashishta, this is that younger brother of mine, and I am the elder. Oh, eminent-saint, I am bestowing those 
brides with a highly gladdened heart... Seetha for Rama, and Urmila for Lakshmana, let there be felicity for all... [1-71-20, 
21a]

Shlok 21b- 22a: My daughter Seetha is the bounty for bravery and in simile she is the daughter of the divine Providence, and thus the second 
one Urmila too... oh, eminent-saint, with a highly gladdened heart I reiterate thrice while I bestow those brides, there 
is no doubt about it... [1-71-21b, 22a]

[Commentary] The thrice reiteration is the threefold commitment mano vaak-kaaya-karaNaaH i.e., 'the three instruments of communication, 
mind, voice, and body... so I endow the brides whole-heartedly, clear-articulately, and agleam-physically...' Here this 
verse is addressed to Vashishta, while other mms say that it is aimed at Dasharatha by placing words 'raghunandana' instead 
of 'munipungava.'

Shlok 22b: Oh, king Dasharatha, let the preceding ritual of samaavartana, be undertaken, and let manes 
be propitiated by the ritual, naandi-shraadha, and afterwards you make happen the wedding celebrations 
... thus, all will be blest... [1-71-22b, 23]

[Commentary] The wording godaana differs from the ordinary lexical meaning 'cow donation' as the word gaavaka means 
body hair and daana is releasing, or let-going, i.e., shaving. When the students return home after the studentship 
they will be admitted into household after some rituals like shaving off unnecessary hair, taking oil bath etc.
go-dvayoH tu rashmiH dR^ig- 
baaNa-svarja-vajraambu-lomasu - naa naa - go daanam caulavat kaaryam shoDaShe abde taducyate | In this 
there will be a real cow donation also to the teacher of that student, when the students sheds his hair, after the barber 
attends him. After shaving off the unwanted hair, then samaavartana is undertaken. The problem pointed out at this 
place is, that Rama or Lakshmana are born without vyanjana-kesha unwanted hair, except head-hair, as Indian mythology 
will not give a hairy makeup to these four brothers. 'How then Janaka asked to undertake such ceremony, when discardable 
hair itself is not there...' is the objection. Whether they have hair or not, the ceremony has to go on.

Shlok 24: Oh, great dextrous Dasharatha, the star ruling today is magha, isn't it... oh, lord, on the 
third from now, say day after tomorrow, when the star phaalguNi comes, in its later part, namely
uttara-phalugNi, you may make happen this wedding, and the bounties like
go-bhuu-tila-hiraNyaadi i.e., ' cows, lands, grains, gold etc., that ensue the wellbeing 
of Rama and Lakshmana, may be accorded to the eligible generously... [1-71-24]

[Commentary] These old people have meticulously calculated stars and their sidereal times for marriage, but being old, they have forgotten 
to print the date of wedding on wedding invitations or, at least said about it. Thereby the dating of Ramayana has become 
a problem, and dating with Ramayana prospered.



SARGA 72
------------------------------

[Text] Vishvamitra proposes the marriages of Bharata ad Shatrughna with the two daughters of Kushadhvaja, the younger 
			brother of Janaka. This being a welcome offer, Janaka accords his immediate consent. Then Dasharatha proceeds 
			with the initiatory rituals for the bridegrooms and donates cows and riches.

Shlok 1: Then the eminent-saint Vishvamitra together with Vashishta said these words to Janaka, the valiant king of Videha, who has 
just said about his lineage. [1-72-1]

Shlok 2: The Ikshvaku-s and Videha-s are unimaginably admirable and immeasurably distinguished dynasties, oh, Janaka, the best one 
among all men, there is no single king comparable to one from these dynasties... [1-72-2]

Shlok 3: Oh, king Janaka, these espousals of Seetha with Rama and Urmila with Lakshmana is behovely to each other's dynastical prestige 
and even it is befitting to the winsome charms of the brides and bridegrooms, but that being so... [1-72-3]

Shlok 4: Oh, grand sire, you may listen to my words of advise... this younger brother of yours, king Kushadhvaja, is at home in 
every kind of probity... [1-72-4]

Shlok 5: Oh, king, the pair of daughters of this right-minded Kushadhvaja is nonpareil in comeliness in this world, hence, oh, grand 
sire, we choose to pair them off with Bharata and Shatrughna... [1-72-5]

Shlok 6: Oh, king, for the sake of those two honourable boys, for that young man Bharata and for that smart man Shatrughna, we opt 
your brother's daughters... [1-72-6]

Shlok 7: All these four sons of Dasharatha have handsomeness and youthfulness, and they are equal to the four rulers of the world 
from four quarters, and their valour vies with the valour of God Vishnu... [1-72-7]

Shlok 8: "Oh, best king, let both these dynasties of yours, the impeccable dynasty of Ikshvaku-s and the immaculate dynasty of yours 
as well, be interlocked by these wedlock-s..." Thus Vishvamitra advised Janaka. [1-72-8]

Shlok 9: On hearing the words of Vishvamitra that have the concurrence of Vashishta then Janaka reverently said this to those two 
eminent-saints. [1-72-9]

Shlok 10: By which reason you two eminent-saints personally bid fair to this befitting proposal, thereby I opine that my dynasty 
is highly honoured... [1-72-10]

Shlok 11: So be it! Safe betides you all! Let the pair of Kushdhvaja's daughters, namely Maandavi, Shrutakiirti, devout themselves 
as a pair of wives to the paired brothers, namely Bharata and Shatrughna, respectively... [1-72-11]

Shlok 12: Oh, eminent-saint Vishvamitra, let the palms of four princesses be taken in the palms of these four mettlesome princes 
in marriage, in the light of one day... [1-72-12]

Shlok 13: "Oh, Brahman, the savants acclaim that part of the day as the best for wedding ceremonies when both of the pre-Phalguni 
and post-Phalguni stars are available, and on such a time where post-Phalguni is ruling, for which Bhaga is the presiding 
deity for progeny..." So said Janaka to the marriage party. [1-72-13]

[Commentary] There is a lot of commentary from the viewpoint of astrology regarding these stars and days of this marriage. Some have 
said that uttare divase 'on best day...' phalguni= puurva phalguni 'pre-Phalguni... on the best day under 
pre-Phalguni star...' which usually does not happen, but it is also said to be correct by Maheshvara Tiirtha, as the Moon 
will be in the 12th house at that time, so the marriage is agreeable...' However the stars for best results of marriages 
are: rohiNii-mR^igashiirShyaaNi 
uttaraphalgunii-svaati iti vivaahasya nakShatraaNi | bodhaayana suutraaNi

Shlok 14: On saying those gracious words thus, king Janaka got up from his throne and coming nigh of both of the eminent-saints, Vishvamitra 
and Vashishta, reverently said this sentence. [1-72-14]

Shlok 15: You two, oh, eminent-saints, have done an excellent generous act in my respect, thus I will ever remain your proselyte... 
you may please preside over these thrones, that of mine, my brother's, and that of Dasharatha... [1-72-15]

[Commentary] The kind deed done by the two sages, Vishvamitra and Vashishta, is fetching right husbands for his daughters, and for his 
brother's daughters, without flattening his own flatties. And this sitting on the three thrones is for assuming symbolic 
rulership on the three kingdoms, Ayodhya, Mithila, and Saamkaasya, in getting the marriages performed without a hitch.

Shlok 16: "As to how this city Mithila appertains to Dasharatha, in the same way city of Ayodhya is mine... and there shall be no 
hesitancy for you two sages in governance on these three kingdoms, thus it will be apt of you to make the marriages happen 
as aptly as you can..." So said Janaka to the sages. [1-72-16]

Shlok 17: The legatee of Raghu-s king Dasharatha is gladdened while the legatee of Videha is talking in such a hobnobbing way, and 
he replied king Janaka in this way. [1-72-17]

Shlok 18: Oh, kings of Mithila, Janaka and Kushadhvaja, you two brothers have reverenced inestimable sages and coteries of kings, 
as such inestimable good manners are treasured in both of you... [1-72-18]

[Commentary] Annex: 'As said in good sayings like, 'good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue...' as such, your abilities 
in making these marriages happen will edge out our limited capabilities... and if we commit any mistake unwittingly, that 
may besmirch your unblemished personality, because for the first time I am marrying my sons, you shall pardon... by the 
way, you have performed many marriages, concluding that every bride is your own daughter-like, thus we hear... thus, your 
sitting complacently on intrusting all the works of marriages to us, is infeasible... so, you do all the works and we sit 
comfortably seeing the celebrations...'

Shlok 19: "Enjoy that blessedness! Let safe betide you! We now depart to our visitatorial-palace, and we shall customarily carry out 
the tributary rituals..." Dasharatha said thus. [1-72-19]

Shlok 20: On seeking leave of absence from the sovereign of people, Janaka, that highly renowned king Dasharatha promptly departed 
from there, keeping both of the eminent-saints afore, namely Vishvamitra and Vashishta. [1-72-20]

Shlok 21: King Dasharatha on going to his visitatorial-palace has procedurally undertaken the tributary rituals, and on getting up 
in the next morning, he carried out the initiatory rituals of marriages, in a grand way, in which donation of cows is a 
part. [1-72-21]

Shlok 22: That lord of people king Dasharatha has righteously donated hundred thousand cows to Brahman-s, in the name of each of his 
four sons. [1-72-22]

Shlok 23-24: In that cow donation ceremony intended for his sons, he that best one among men and the one who is affectionate towards 
his sons, Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, has donated on behalf of each of his sons, four hundred thousand cows, that 
are abundant milkers, and that have golden casings on their horns, and that are with their calves, and along with milking 
jugs made with bell metal, and he even donated very many other kinds of assets to Brahmans. [1-72-23, 24]

Shlok 25: On performing the cow donations and samaavartana, snaataka, the initiatory ceremonies of his 
sons, as well, he that serene king Dasharatha who is amidst the quartet of his sons, shone forth like serene Brahma, who 
is quartet-faced, with the quartet of Veda-s, and who is the overlord of mankind, amidst the quartet of presiding deities 
in the quartet of the world. [1-72-25]

[Commentary] The 'unnecessarily' repeated word 'quartet' refers to dharma where its manifestation is with four horns, catvaarii 
shR^ingaa, trayo asya paadaa, dve shiirSe... 'dharma's horns is a quartet, three are its feet, two are its heads...' 
so on. When read together with 23, 24 verses, the bullish Dasharatha is said to have the quartet of bullhorn like sons, 
who are being readied to administer dharma in the world.



SARGA 73
------------------------------



We need not wait for any invitation or wedding card or call for this marriage, as all are welcome, equally and individually. 
Let us go there straight, without any introductions and preliminaries.

Shlok 1: On which day the king Dasharatha made the impressive cow donations or, initiatory rites, on that day alone the valiant Yudhaajit 
turned up. [1-73-1]

Shlok 2: Yudhaajit, the son of Kekaya king and the brother of Kaikeyi, thus the direct maternal uncle of Bharata, having seen and 
asked after the wellbeing of Dasharatha said this to him. [1-73-2]

Shlok 3: The ruler and king of Kekaya, viz., my father and your father-in-law, has affectionately asked after the wellbeing of all, 
and in whose wellbeing you are interested at my place, they are all hale and healthy as of now... [1-73-3]

Shlok 4: Oh, Raghu's legatee, oh, best king, my father and the king of Kekaya is interested to see my sister Kaikeyi's son, Bharata, 
and for that reason I am sent to Ayodhya... [1-73-4]

Shlok 5- 6a: "Oh, lord of the land, in Ayodhya I have heard that you went to Mithila along with your sons for their marriages, and wishing 
to see my sister's son Bharata I promptly travelled here..." Thus Yudhaajit told Dasharatha. [1-73-5, 6a]

[Commentary] Is this entry of this maternal uncle of Bharata a forced one or does this have any bearing on the flow of epic... is a doubt, 
though not a question. Further he is saying 'my sister's son' i.e., Bharata alone, instead of 'all my nephews...' Whether 
this episode has a bearing on future events or not, one maama is entered in Indian epics, like this one and 
Shakuni maama in Maha Bharata.

Shlok 6b-7a: Then king Dasharatha on seeing the adorable guest who arrived in his presence, and who is a merited one for adoration, Dasharatha 
adored Yudhaajit well, with full observances. [1-73-6b, 7a]

Shlok 7b- 8: Then on taking rest for that night along with his noble-minded sons, and again on getting up in the next morning, and on 
performing morning-observances as a duty-bound king, Dasharatha arrived at the hall of Vedic-ritual, keeping the sages in 
his forefront. [1-73-7b-8]

[Commentary] He arrived at the Vedic-ritual hall that he was frequenting for the last few days. Unless invited the bridegroom's party 
will not enter the marriage hall, and nowadays such an invitation includes a small function also, called varapuuja 
as every bridegroom will be looked up to as Vishnu, and the bride as Lakshmi. The marriage hall is constructed nearby this 
Vedic-ritual hall, thus it is to be assumed.

Shlok 9-10a: Rama arrived at his father together with all of his brothers, keeping sage Vashishta and other eminent-saint ahead of them, 
on an opportune and appropriate hour called 'Victory...' and all the bridegrooms are adorned with all kinds of jewellery 
appropriate for the wedding time, and all have performed the auspicious ceremony for marriage-thread, conducted prior to 
the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent 
to marriage ceremony. [1-73-9, 10a]

[Commentary] The ceremony for the marriage thread, the sacred thread of marriage for knotting as a necklace of the bride, mangala- 
suutra is nowadays mixed up with gauri-puuja, and this gauri-puuja took precedence of that ceremony, 
because gauri-puuja, took its roots in the auxiliary Ramayana-s, where Seetha is said to have gone to Goddess 
Parvati's temple, prior to her marriage, to perform gauri-puuja, pledging herself to Rama. The thread bands tied 
at the wrists of both the bride and bridegroom is as per wedding time vows, to bring them under the pledge of marriage, 
until its consummation. Indian marriages are time-oriented and every function has to happen on the appointed hour. Hence, 
the arrival of bridegrooms is also on an opportune hour, which astrologically brings forth success of that event. But some 
say that this auspicious hour Vijaya occurs in the early part of the day, where this marriage is occurring in the later 
part of day, hence this time is to be reckoned as one that acquires some victory later in the epic.

[Commentary] Brides are not the lone category of people destined to wear jewellery. But bridegrooms are also asked to wear golden ornaments, 
at least one, on such occasions. The metal gold is said to contain some effect by which a man or a woman will be benefited, 
health wise: mR^itaa durluptam madhumat suvarNam dhanam jananam ruNam daarayiSunam... after all gold is gold.

Shlok 10b- 11: Then that godly sage Vashishta on going from Vedic-ritual hall to marriage hall said this to Janaka, "Oh, best one among 
best people, oh, king Janaka, having performed the auspicious marriage-thread ceremony, Dasharatha along with his sons is 
looking forward for the donor... [1-73-10b, 11]

Shlok 12: "In marriages all the puruSaartha-s , the component values of life, namely rightness, riches, 
revelries, and results of final release will be occurring only if the benefactor and beneficiary meet, isn't it. Hence let 
king Dasharatha come, and then on actualising this best marriage you too will be doing your best devoir as royal priest... 
[1-73-12]

[Commentary] Hindu marriage is not a contractual obligation because it protracts over seven life cycles of that couple. Therefore, it 
is calculated correctly and celebrated sacredly.

Shlok 13: Janaka is not just a decidedly valiant king but he is the profound knower of probity also, besides being an unreservedly 
generous king, hence he has already made all arrangements, and when he is spoken in this way by Vashishta that king replied 
this sentence to that right honourable Vashishta. [1-73-13]

Shlok 14: Who is that doorman that prevents your entry? Or, for whose orders you all await with a bated breath? Do you hesitate in 
your own house, or what? This kingdom is as good as yours... isn't so... [1-73-14]

[Commentary] These are neither questions nor surprises, but the usual retorts and repartees usually employed during wedding time by both 
parties, sandhi-s of northerners and sammandi-s, of southerners, i.e., the wedding parties. By these rebuttals 
and ripostes, both the parties come close with each other's family habits or with its members.

Shlok 15: Oh, eminent-saint Vashishta, on absolutely performing the auspicious ceremony for the marriage-thread, and thereby tying 
thread-band at wrists my daughters have already arrived, and they are at the base of the Altar of Fire, like the irradiant 
jets of flames of radiant fire... [1-73-15]

Shlok 16: "I am already ready and awaiting for you remaining at this Altar of Fire. Let everything be done indeed without any deterrents. 
What for the king Dasharatha is dawdling..." So said Janaka to Vashishta. [1-73-16]

[Commentary] And Vashishta reported this to Dasharatha, and Dasharatha and his coterie then started a wedding-walk, which usually will 
be dillydallying, inching and poking along, very leisurely. Even today this custom, not custom exactly, the habit of 'wedding-walks' 
is there and a baraat 'pageant of bridegroom's party' covers two furlong distance in two hours, or even more, keeping 
the bride's party on tenterhooks.

Shlok 17: On hearing that sentence of Janaka, then Dasharatha started towards marriage hall, and then he started to enter his sons 
one by one, four in all, into marriage hall along with all of the assemblages of sages. [1-73-17]

Shlok 18- 19a: Then that king from Videha bloodline, Janaka, said in this way to Vashishta, "Oh, the knower of punctilios, oh, Brahma-sage, 
oh, masterly sage, along with other sages you make happen all of the marriage ceremonies of Rama, the rejoicer of the world..." 
Thus Janaka spoke to Vashishta. [1-73-18, 19a]

Shlok 19b- 20- 21- 22- 23a: Thus said, that godly sage Vashishta on saying, "so be it," to Janaka, embarked on arranging Altar of Fire keeping sage 
Vishvamitra and the virtuous sage Shataananda afore of him, and that sage with great ascesis, Vashishta, has arranged an 
Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. 
Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with 
just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, 
and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled 
wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk 
etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and 
he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. [1-73-19b, 20, 
21, 22, 23a]

[Commentary] These are some of the usual paraphernalia for marriage ceremony even now. The sprouting sprigs are symbolic for the prospective 
sprigs from this marriage, and rice-flakes for the abundance of livelihood of the couple. Usually the concave lid like vessels 
will be filled with black cotton soil, and on them nine varieties of grain navadhaanya will be sprinkled to obtain 
sprigs. Later they are to be kept sacred for some days, watering daily, and then can be implanted in earth, if they survive. 
There are hosts of shops specialised to sell these items and the shopkeeper firstly asks for information 'for bride's side 
or for bridegroom's side?' And if we say, 'we are from bride's side' a long-list is presented, [while bridegroom's side 
will have a shorter list of items,] and then the shopkeeper mercifully asks 'how much is the dowry?' If we say this much 
or that much, he will present a Victorian model push-close pull-open velvet bag. If we exclaim 'what for is this, priest 
has not listed this' then he politely says, 'the priests of these days are unaware of customs and the dowry is to be put 
in that velvet bag and then given, as a royal presentation...' And if we say 'we are drained out by the dowry, wherefrom 
we give royal presentations...' then he will spew fire on us saying 'you spend so much on dowry, can't you purchase its 
velvet bag...' and thereafter a sermon follows about the dying Indian culture at the onslaught of westernisation, while 
he starts throwing the packets of navadhaanya etc., as though he is giving alms to the beggar. Though Janaka has 
not purchased such a bag of dowry, he has some more problems with this marriage. A discussion on this is there at later 
part. Here the sprouted sprigs are the sprouting avengers on the evil, called Ravana.

Shlok 23b- 24: Then that great resplendent and eminent-saint Vashishta neatly overlaid even-sized sacred grass on that Altar of Fire synchronising 
with Vedic-chants, and on preparing Ritual-fire by rubbing two wooden sticks, called araNi 
, he placed that fire in the pit of Altar, which is aflame now, and then reverently and in tune with the Vedic-hymns he 
effused oblational liquids into that Altar of Fire, with short-handled and long-handled wooden scoops. [1-73-23b, 24]

Shlok 25- 26a: Then that king Janaka led forth Seetha, who by now is decorated with every variety of bridal jewellery, and on positioning 
her en face Raghava in the presence of Altar of Fire, then Janaka addressed Rama who is the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's 
rejoice. [1-73-25, 26a]

[Commentary] By the way, where is this Kausalya? Does Rama enrich her happiness without bringing her to his marriage? We have not heard 
of her or of other queens or hosts of his other wives, for the last three, four days. Has she come, at all? - Yes, she has 
come and she is physically present - is the argument of some, basing on Valmiki's style of unrecorded accounts on trivial, 
or matter of fact scenes. They are implied and implicit. Dasharatha has performed some cow donations, religious functions 
etc., which he is not supposed to do without his wife at his side. These ladies are implicitly included in the first verse 
of sixty-ninth chapter: sopaadhyaayaH sabaandhavaH 'with teachers, with relatives...' and Dasharatha has no 
near relatives, not exactly relatives, but family, other than his queens and sons. So, they all are in 'et cetera... and 
others' cadre at present. Other way round, it is said in Kshatriya-s only male members will go and get the bride, which 
has no reasonable or tenable import, as far as marriages are concerned, and where every marriage concerns only with womenfolk 
and their panoply.

[Commentary] Seetha is said to have all bridal jewellery, which is not odd or particular to this corner of globe. But it is oddish and 
exotic jewellery if the bride is from well-to-do family or from royal family. Though not all, some of the jewellery items 
that are almost extinct now are listed here. siimanta-pralamba a pendant clipped at back of head, dangle through 
the central parting of head-hair, onto the crown of head, with nine-gem-stud locket; shiroja-suuci diamond studded 
hair pins on either side of head above ears; naasaabharanam a round nasal ring; naasabhuSaNam single 
or a pair of nine-gems studded nasal ornament; karNaabharaNa, taaTanka, karNikaa various kinds of earrings with 
dangling cups, to which trinket bells dangle; shata-yaSTika hundred stringed pearl necklace; anukanThii, muktaavalii, 
graiveyikam and many other kinds of necklaces; mekhala three finger width golden cincture, studded with nine-gems, 
and with fine golden chains dangling like festoons; saptakii seven stringed girdle string, where the strings dangle 
onto hip, with expanding festoons; keyuuram bicep-lets; kankaNam bracelets and bangles from wrist halfway 
up forearm; maNi-manjiira, tulaa-koTi, paadaangada ankle-let with kinkiNii trinket bell-globules; 
cuuDaamaNi a circular jewel at bun of hair from which a gold sheet dangles till the end of braid, on which all zodiac 
signs are engraved. At the top, on the left and right of this cuuDaamaNi ornaments in the shape of sun and moon 
are pinned into hair, and at the end of braid three / five gold cups studded with hair like strands upakaca will 
be dangling. This set of braid's ornamentation is said to receive the solar energy to whole of the spine. So goes on and 
on the list of ornaments, to the delight of the girl wearing them and to the delight of the goldsmith making them.

[Commentary] Here there are five Raghava-s and only one kausalyaanandavardhana i.e., Rama. Then poet should have simply said 
'Rama' instead of 'Raghava' but there are many Rama-s, Parashu Rama, and Bala Rama and suchlike, and on such calling as 
'Rama...' Parashu Rama, who is scheduled to enter after marriage, may perhaps enter now, in a faux pas. Then the poet should 
have said dasharathaatmajam . Then, who will be that single soul from among the four boys of Dasharatha to come 
forward. And if all the four hear the calling, as 'oh, Raghava' all will reply in chorus "ok, it is I..." then what will 
happen? Avoiding all these irksome situations, the poet gave this stage-direction to Janaka that he should aim at the son 
of Kausalya, with a subtext, 'you are mothered by some human female, whereas my daughter is motherless, rather un-mothered,
ayonijaa non-foetal is her origination, hence it is apt of you to not to belittle her, anytime and anywhere... 
and you have to keep faith with her, since she outshines in outperforming your task in this so-called incarnation...'

Shlok 26b- 27a: "This is Seetha, my daughter, she acquits herself in whatever duty you undertake. Take her wishfully, let safeness betide 
you, take her palm into your palm..." [1-73-26b, 27a]



Here Sita stands, my daughter fair, / The duties of thy life to share. / Take from her father, take thy bride, / Join hand 
to hand, and bliss betide! / - Ralph T. H. Griffith



The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza iyam, mama, 
tava 'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at 
some of them.



Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told "take her...' Why this iyam 
i.e., "this" It is explained as below:



Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking 
at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers



Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?



Janaka: Because she is 'Seetha '



Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion...



[Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his 'The Windhover' sheer plod 
makes plough down sillion /]



Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel 
of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because 
of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol 
of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally 
tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under 
your feet... vedaaham etam puruSham mahaantam aadityavarNam tamasaH parastaat | if the Supreme Person beyond 
darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul aham vedmi mahaatmaanam 
raamam satyaparaakramam - bala 19-14 likewise you shall know iyam siitaa, for she is somebody to match you... 
have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s



Rama: Why not every bit of it...  you name, it I tell it



Janaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?



Adi Shankara's commentary: There are three letters that denote the Absolute sa, ta, yam; and the syllable
ii on sat is for easy pronunciation. The letter sa indicates immortality and the word ta 
mortality, and the syllable yam conditions and bridges both the above ' Ramanuja comment: The letter 
sat is immortality and the letter ti is mortality and yam conditions both, hence sattiyam 
is indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness ' Madhvaacaarya says: sat, delivered immortal souls;
ti yet to be delivered bounded souls; yam both the delivered and bounded souls.



Janaka: Seetha is that yam the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal, setu - eSa 
setu iti vidhaaraNaa the presiding deity of cetana-acetana dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu 
Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion, raaghavatve bhavet siitaa... It is said 
in yet another scripture, yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii 
ca tathaa iishvarii || 'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller 
of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha 
alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth ratna-garbhaa and you are 
a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold anargham api maaNikyam 
hemaashrayam apekShate otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning 
you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or 
more Ravana-s



Rama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi



Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is 
manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also, ayam iishvarii is manifest as iyam this girl... from siitaa 
furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, 
and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above 
mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours



Rama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?



Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge 
from earth, a lovely act for you.



Rama: Then why mama sutaa... she can be fostered in any orphanage



Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not 
just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming 
of vi-deha... it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background 
and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as mama sutaa 'my daughter ' And many, many 
kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to 
counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; 
a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha, iyam siitaa 
mama sutaa as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards



Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey



Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in kanyaa-daana 'bestowal of bride ' because your 
marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... 
that is why I tell pratiicCha enaaam ' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me;
bhadram te 'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yours paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa ' you take her palm 
into your palm ' that which is customary in human paaNigrahaNa-mahotsava 'wedding ceremony '; by the way, you 
always keep your consort in your heart hR^idaya kamala do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your 
incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may 
come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby

[Commentary] Likewise, let us, the readers of rAmAyaNa, keep this info about Rama undisclosed to Ravana, if any of us meet Ravana by 
chance....



And we now proceed to the human level import of this verse.



Janaka: 'iyam "this girl" who has --- mugdhamanoharamanoj~namohanaatmakasukumaarasoundaryalaavaNyaadau--- 
a beauty par excellence [and par problmatique beauty as well, for Ravana alone has got more words to extol her beauty, as 
in Ch. 46 Aranya ];



so, iyam "this one" is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started 
towards Mithila;



hence, iyam "this one alone" is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva's bow, and 
whom you are envisioning praasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH 'on verandas of multistoried 
buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you ' during these days of your stay 
in Mithila....



Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral 
conclusion...



Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my 
daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that 
hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so,
iyam siita was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow...



Rama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans



Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I said mama sutaa 'my daughter ' when it is said mahataa 
tapasaa raama... ' by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama.. what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and 
fostered this girl with much better ascesis [than your father], and even protected her from warring factions [only to give 
back to you ]; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, 
why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal 
enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I said
sahadharmacarii tava ' she will be in toe with your duties'



tava dharmasahacarii ' whatever is your duty that duty become hers too '..



Rama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even



Janaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her... I have not said siitaam dadaami 
'I am donating Seetha ' but I said pratiicCha enaam 'take her, take her back ' or else, she will exit as she came 
and unfulfilled will be your mission... it is up to you to decide.... no compulsion whatsoever...



Rama: Then, let her take hold of my arrow and walk with me round the Altar of Fire, because, for Kshatriya-s that is the 
custom...



Janaka: I know, I know, but this marriage does not fit into any of the eight kinds of marriage prescribed for humans... 
hence I carefully said paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa' take her palm into your palm '

[Commentary] The types of ancient marriages as laid down by scriptures are eight kinds. 1] braahmya: inviting a celibate scholar 
after completion of his Vedic studies, and offering a bride with due ceremony; 2] daiva: offering a bride to a 
ritwik when he is conducting a Vedic-ritual; 3] aarSa: giving the bride after donating a cow and ox for the success 
of Vedic-ritual; 4] praajaapatya: offering a bride without seeking anything from the bridegroom, to follow the 
course of dharma; 5] aasura: giving ample money to bride's party or to bride and marrying her at costs; 6] gaandharva: 
man and woman falling in love and marrying on their own, just out of lust and bodily pleasures; 7] raakShasa: if 
a bride or bride's part do not agree, by maltreating, torturing and terrorising them, and thereby seizing the bride; 8]
paishaacika: while the girl is asleep, or making her drunk, or unconscious and then molesting her, by which she 
becomes a 'can't but' bride - a worst kind of marriage.

vivaaha iti cet - sahadharmacarii tava - iti uktyaa praajaapatya eva vivaahaH - dk

[Commentary] And when none of the eight is unsuitable for Seetha's wedding it is brought under the fourth praajaapatya- because
sahadharmam carati iti praajaapatya - aashvalaayana | samyogamantraH praajaapatye sahadharmam caryataam - gautama 
| sahadharmam carataam iti praajaapatyam - bodhaayana | But here something is sought from the bridegroom, in the 
name of lifting the bow. But that is negated saying the 'seeking' is the seeking of material assets, not valour or bravery. 
It is namesake, and even the nomenclature that Seetha is the bounty for valour viiryashulkaais a namesake; 
kShatriyeShu viirya vara eva shreShTatvaat taadR^ishaya kanyaam pradaatum viirya parishodhanam kR^itam iti shulka iti kathanaat 
shulka-shabdaH aupacaarikaH | dk Hence this marriage is for implementation of righteousness and it is treated as extramundane 
and celebrated every year.



Rama: This marriage does not fit into any category! Then why this marriage at all!



Janaka: To be in tune with this world's tradition... however, this marriage technically comes under the category of 
praajaapatya



Rama: So, you adjusted the rule books... then why me, let her take my hand...



Janaka: The enjoyer has to grab the object of enjoyment, not vice versa... take her now and bhadram te and 'be 
blest '

[Commentary] Next, Janaka is asking the bridegroom like a poor Indian father to take a poor and motherless bride Seetha.



Janaka: iyam - 'this' girl is a simple match to you who broke the bow of Shiva;



siitaa' born in furrow' a motherless girl, hence, kindly be merciful towards her;



mama sutaa ' my daughter ' rather, a poor fellow's daughter; where I have always been engaged in rituals and ceremonies, 
thereby I may not have brought her up properly, and thereby if she does talk rashly or behave oddly, like an ill-bred girl, 
kindly tolerate and correct her;



sahadhrmacarii iva where iva is ' like ' just take her like your 'custom-bound consort ' and let her 
be useful in ceremonies and rituals, though not for pleasure trips and excursions ';



pratiicCha enaam 'take her ' where the bridegrooms usually woo, court and date girls, send many messages to her 
parents asking for that girl in marriage; but, this girl being an uncommon one, I am begging you to take her;



paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa you take her hand as she is hesitating to take your hand, for your hand is strong enough 
to break an unbreakable bow, she is fearing to take your hand, lest her arm too will be broken;



bhadram te 'be blest ' when you honour our appeal



And there are many, many more shades of meanings derived from this verse, but all culminate to say - 'you two are made for 
each other '

Shlok 27b- 28a: "She who is prosperous and husband-devout, will always be abiding you like your own shadow..." So saying that king Janaka 
then poured forth water into the palms of Rama, which is sanctified with hymns. [1-73-27b, 28a]

[Commentary] Pouring water at the time of donation into the donee's hand symbolises the free flowing will of the donor. The 'shadow' 
expresses nitya-sambandhatva 'ever related entity...' Or, a trace of His liilaa-vibhuuti, maayaa. Though 
they are living separately so far, that farness is now washed off by this holy water.

Shlok 28b- 29a: Then there occurred great flower-showers from firmament, while sages and gods staying in firmament have exclaimed, "nice... 
fine..." to the drumbeats of heavenly drums. [1-3-28b, 29a]

[Commentary] What happened to these gods when boyish Rama eliminated Tataka and others? Are they any lesser feats than this marriage? 
And why this drumming and showering flowers and blessings, when it is 'just' a human's marriage? Now the cause for the effect 
is conjoined to Rama to effectuate their plea to Brahma. If the entire arsenal given by Vishvamitra is set-aside for a moment, 
the 'present' now presented by Janaka is the ultimate weapon for the use against Ravana. aprameyam hi tat tejo yasya 
saa janakaatmajaa 'unlimited is the energy, to whom Janaka's daughter belongs...' Rama is the instrumental cause 
in eliminating Ravana, whereas Seetha is the efficient cause for it. Lanka is ruined by Seetha, through Hanuma with the 
help of Fire-god, but not by Rama, or all of the monkeys put together. And Rama eliminates the half-dead Ravana. There are 
some more flower-showers and drumbeats and dances, later.

Shlok 29b- 30a: On handing over his daughter Seetha who is duly sanctified with sanctified waters, King Janaka is completely overwhelmed 
with exhilaration for the successful performance of his bit as a father and he said this. [1-73-29b, 30a]

Shlok 30b- 31a: Come on, Lakshmana, safe betides you... say yes to Urmila, the one who is decided by me to be given to you... take her 
palm into yours... lapse not the time... [1-73-30b, 31a]

[Commentary] When Bharata is the elder of Lakshmana, how Lakshmana is called now... is a lingering doubt. That rule 'the elder brother's 
marriage is first...' does not apply if the brothers are from co-wives: pitR^ivyaputre saapatne paranaariiShu teShu 
vaa | vivaahadaanayajnaadau parivedo na duuShaNam || 'the elderliness among the sons of father's brothers or mothers 
co-wives, or other sons from other wives, do not count in their marriages, donation ceremonies, of Vedic-rituals... an younger 
one can be called first on such occasions...'

Shlok 31b-32a: Janaka having said to Lakshmana that way, he also addressed Bharata, "Oh, Bharata, the delight of Raghu-s, take Maandavi's 
palm into your palm... [1-73-31b-32a]

Shlok 32b- 33a: That honourable king of Mithila even said to Shatrughna, "oh, dextrous Shatrughna, take the palm of Shrutakiirti into yours... 
[1-73-32b, 33a]

Shlok 33b- 34a: "Oh, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna ... you all are tender-hearted, well-behaved and well-intentioned brothers from 
Kakutstha lineage... without lapse of time take up other ceremonies..." So said Janaka to bridegrooms. [1-73-33b, 34a]

Shlok 34b- 35a: All the four bridegrooms are palminpalmed with all the four brides, paying heed to Janaka's words, and abiding in Vashishta's 
orchestration of Vedic hymns and procedures. [1-73-34b, 35a]

[Commentary] The word 'palminpalmed' may look oddish, but it is in fashion with the verb 'arminarmed' invented by poet Roger McGhou.

Shlok 35b- 36: On performing circumambulations along with their wives around the Ritual-fire, and around the Altar of Fire, and that way, 
around king Janaka, the awarder of wives, and around sages as well for they conducted the marriages well, those great-souled 
bridegrooms that have emerged from Raghu's dynasty on performing further deeds of ritual consistent with custom as directed 
by Vashishta, they are all wed. [1-73-35b, 36]

[Commentary] Firstly Vashishta enkindled the holy fire and offered oblations in it for the wellbeing of Rama and his brothers, say the 
bridegrooms. Next, another round of enkindling of holy fire took place in which Rama and brothers have offered marriage 
time oblations. After accepting the palms of brides, they made circumambulations, and then each couple established its own 
ritual fire and offered oblations into it. Then each couple had oblated rice-flakes into the fire, and again performed circumambulations 
to that Ritual-fire, respectively. Thus, the marriage is not a handshake like one-minute affair, as they all shall be before 
fire, daylong.

Shlok 37: There occurred rich and highly dazzling flower showers from firmament, and that ambience is filled with the drumbeats of 
divine drums and with vocal and instrumental music, and promenades of apsara-s danced, and even the gandharva-s sang tunefully, 
and because it is the marriage of celebrated bridegrooms from Raghu's dynasty, such a charming spectacle is envisioned.. 
[1-73-37, 38]

Shlok 39: In this kind of ongoingness of harmonious music of vocal, instrumental and that of dancers, those great resplendent brothers 
married their wives on circumabulating the Ritual-fire fire thrice. [1-73-39]

Shlok 40: Then those legatees of Raghu went to their visitatorial-palace with their wives, followed by king Dasharatha along with 
the assemblages of sages, kinfolks, queens and wives included, and Dasharatha feasted his eyes on sons and daughter-in-laws. 
[1-73-40]



SARGA 74
------------------------------

[Text] Parashu Rama confronts the wedding party that is returning to Ayodhya from
          Mithila. On his very entry, the atmosphere becomes pell-mell and a whirlwind ensues.
          Expecting some problem from this Parashu Rama, the sages like Vashishta and others starts
          to receive him in a peaceable manner. Not caring anyone around Parashu Rama starts a
          dialogue with Dasharatha Rama.

Shlok 1: When that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, then the eminent-saint
  Vishvamitra on asking for the leave of absence from those kings, Dasharatha and Janaka, and from
  both Rama and Lakshmana, he set out to northern mountains, namely Himalayas. [1-74-1]

Shlok 2: When Vishvamitra departed that ruler to the delight of people, namely Dasharatha,
  on asking leave of absence with king Janaka who outvies bodily affairs, promptly set forth for
  the city of Ayodhya. [1-74-2]

Shlok 3- 4- 5a: Then that king Janaka of Mithila, the one from Videha lineage, gave innumerable
  patrimonial riches. He has also given umpteen number of cows, millions of excellent shawls and
  silk dresses, and elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, besides hundreds of highly
  decorated girls, divine in their mien, as unexcelled chambermaids and handmaidens to the brides.
  [1-74-3, 4, 5a]

Shlok 5b- 6a: King Janaka gave beau idÃ©al bridal riches in gold, silver, pearls and corals even,
  for he is very highly gladdened as Seetha's marriage came true. [1-74-5b, 6a]

Shlok 6b- 7a: Having given many kinds of bridal gifts and having accompanied his daughters for a
  distance, then having received a bid adieu from Dasharatha, that sovereign of Mithila, Janaka,
  re-entered is own palace in Mithila. [1-74-6, 7a]

[Commentary] It is customary to follow the wedding party up to the outskirts of village or
  town. In the meantime, there will be two or three hugs of mother and the bride, shedding two or
  three litres of tears, while the father of the bride secretly wipes his own moist eyes, and the
  like. Because, this despatch of the bride is considered as another life to her, for she cannot
  come to her father's house as and when she wants. Even if she comes, she has  to return to 
	her husband's place at some point of time, because from now onward 'that' house has become 'her'
  house. In this particular case of Seetha, she does not come to Mithila after this episode and
  even when Rama abandons her she goes into the womb of her mother, Mother Earth, but not to
  Mithila. So let us leave Janaka and his queen as they have the satisfaction in marrying their
  daughter, whose marriage itself is problematical so far, and when that has happened, now some
  sort of dissatisfaction has cropped up, in leaving her off with some forest ranger, called
  Rama.

Shlok 7b- 8a: Even the king Dasharatha, the sovereign of Ayodhya proceeded with his noble-souled
  sons, keeping all the sages in the fore, while his forces followed him. [1-74-7b, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9a: But while going with the assemblages of sages and with young Raghava-s, namely
  Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, the sky-bound birds started to screech with startling voice
  from all around facing that tigerly-man Dasharatha. [1-74-8b, 9a]

Shlok 9b- 10a: Also thus, all of the earth bound animals are going his leftward, and on seeing
  this, albeit he is a tigerly king he is perplexed, and particularly asked Vashishta. [1-74-9b,
  10a]

Shlok 10b- 11a: "Unpropitious is the starling voicing of birds, whereby my heart is throbbing
  down... and propitious is the leftward going of the animals, thereby my heart is throbbing up...
  why so?" [1-74-10b, 11a]

Shlok 11b- 12a: On hearing all that is said by king Dasharatha, the instinctual sage Vashishta
  said this sentence in a soothing voice, "I will tell apart the result of these auguries...
  [1-74-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b- 13a: "The shrieks voiced by the birds are foretokening the forthcoming providential and
  perilous trepidation, but the behaviour of these animals is betokening it as mitigable... hence,
  let this consternation be forsaken... [1-74-12b, 13a]

Shlok 13b- 14a: While they are discussing among themselves, a whirlwind started to whirligig
  there, as though to shake the earth and shatter all gigantic trees. [1-74-13b, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 15a: Murkiness enshrouded the sun, thus everyone is unaware of quarters, a sandstorm
  enwrapped that army, by which it has become as though ensorcelled. [1-74-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Then Vashishta and the other sages, the king Dasharatha along with his sons
  remained there with animation, and everything and every other one available there has become
  inanimate. [1-74-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17- 18- 19: In that catastrophic darkness, that sand-muffled military of king Dasharatha has
  seen the son of Sage Jamadagni, namely Bhaargava Rama, the subjugator of kings of kings. He
  appeared calamitous in his look by wearing tufty matted and unruly head-hair, an unassailable one
  like Mt. Kailash, an unbearable one like the Epoch-End-Fire, irradiant with his own radiance,
  hence imperceivable for commoners, and such as he is, he clinched an axe on his right shoulder
  and clasped a bow in his left hand, that in simile is like a congeries of electroluminescence,
  and handling an arrow which is as if ready to electrocute, and he vied in his overall look with
  the devastator of triple cities, namely God Shiva. [1-74-16b, 17, 18, 19]

Shlok 20- 21a: On seeing him who is perilous in his propensity and flaming like the Ritual-fire,
  Vashishta and the other prominent Brahman-s who are the practisers of meditation and
  fire-oblations have come together and started to susurrate, up and down. [1-74-20, 21a]

Shlok 21b-22: "Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by
  the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously
  when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again,
  or what?" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. [1-74-21b, 22]

[Commentary] An account of Parashu Rama's elimination of Kshatriya clans is given in
  endnote.

Shlok 23: After their susurrus the sages have approached him, who in his very look is like a
  visitation, with oblational water and addressed him with benign words of greeting like, "oh,
  Rama, oh, Bhaargava Rama..." [1-74-23]

Shlok 24: On receiving the deference paid by the sage Vashishta, that inexorable Rama of
  Jamadagni started to talk to Rama of Dasharatha. [1-74-24]



SARGA 75
------------------------------

[Text] The visitant Parashu Rama narrates the legends of bows of Vishnu and Shiva to Rama. Unheedful of the request of Dasharatha 
to spare his sons, Parashu Rama addresses Dasharatha Rama directly and asks him to take an aim with the longbow of Vishnu, 
and if Dasharatha Rama is capable to do so, Parashu Rama says that he will give a duel to him.

Shlok 1: Oh, valiant Rama of Dasharatha, your valour is bruited as a sensational valour, and sensational is your smashing of Shiva's 
bow, also thus I have thoroughly heard about your others deeds like elimination of Tataka et cetera... [1-75-1]

Shlok 2: That way, smashing of that particular bow of Shiva is wondrous and even unimaginable... on hearing that alone I happened 
upon you, bringing another outranking bow... [1-75-2]

Shlok 3: This alone is that catastrophic bow received through Sage Jamadagni... flex it with an arrow on bowstring stretching up 
to your ear, and in that way show your capability... [1-75-3]

Shlok 4: "Thereby, on examining your strength in your taking aim with this bow, and should you be deservedly valorous, I will give 
you a combative duel..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-75-4]

[Commentary] Pt. Satya Vrat cites this in his book 'The Ramayana - A Linguistic Study... 'As in English, we speak of yuddhadaanam 
- giving a fight to the enemy - in Sanskrit, too...' it is giving a duel.

Shlok 5: On hearing that sentence of Bhaargava Rama, then king Dasharatha became a pitiable one, and with a downcast face and adjoined 
palms said this. [1-75-5]

Shlok 6: Aren't you a Brahman with inviolable ascesis, and whose rancour on Kshatriya-s has calmed down long back. Why this hostility 
again. It'll be apt of you to award aegis to my sons, for they are yet youngsters... [1-75-6]

[Commentary] Vividly: 'peace is primary for Brahman-s... though that was once disturbed in you, you redeemed it after your eradicating 
the then ruthless Kshatriya-s... thus your rancour was appeased then... and you too peacefully retired for inviolable ascesis 
and acquired still higher bliss by them... do you now wish to violate your own intrinsic nature of peacefulness being a 
blissful one, being an all-knower, being an elderly Brahman, that too on mere boys...

Shlok 7: Aren't you from the bloodline of Bhaargava-s who always conduct themselves in self-study of Vedas and self-principled ways... 
haven't you readily discarded weapon-wielding on your promise to Thousand-eyed Indra... [1-75-7]

[Commentary] Annex: 'how can you abnegate your own promise of shastrasanyaasa 'reclusion from weaponry...' by wielding a weapon 
now, and thus becoming yourself a self-critical personality, and thus making the entire Brahman-hood as a self-contradictory 
classis...

Shlok 8: Such as you were, you on becoming a dedicatee to probity, haven't you given the planet earth to Kashyapa and haven't you 
repaired to forests, and haven't you flagged yourself on Mt. Mahendra... [1-75-8]

[Commentary] Annex: 'if so, is this for showing the flag or else is it for keeping the flag flying... in anyway, is it inapt of you to 
eliminate the progeny of your own donee... Kashyapa... and if you say that 'I don't kill you all nonentities, but my target 
is this Rama...' then my reply will be like this...

Shlok 9: "Or, oh, insurmountable sage, have you chanced upon us for a total annihilation of ours... when Rama is singularised and 
eliminated, nay-said that we all will be living..." Thus Dasharatha had gone on appealing in his love for his sons. [1-75-9]

[Commentary] Annex: 'should you leave off Rama and eliminate rest of us all, Rama will not live... or, if you leave all of us and eliminate 
Rama alone, we all don't live... anywise it is an 'anywise' annihilation of ours... for I am still living for this Rama, 
and Rama alone...'

Shlok 10: While Dasharatha is speaking in that way that intransigent Bhaargava Rama of Sage Jamadagni uncaring for those merciful 
words of Dasharatha addressed Rama of Dasharatha alone. [1-75-10]

Shlok 11: These are the two strong and sturdy unsurpassed longbows, well-designed by gods and well-crafted by Vishvakarma, the Divine 
Architect, and these are very important among all bows and well-worshipped by all worlds... one broken in your, and the 
other in my hand... [1-75-11]

Shlok 12: Oh, best one among men, out of the two longbows gods gave one to restive Trymbaka, God Shiva for a combat with demon Tripura, 
and oh, Kakutstha, that bow alone is the annihilator of Tripura, the demon... and you have broken that alone... [1-75-12]

Shlok 13- 14a: This is the second one and the choicest gods gave this to Vishnu, thereby this is named after Him as 'Vishnu's bow...' 
this is an indestructible and enemy-citadel conquering longbow... and this is identical in its efficacy with Rudra's longbow... 
[1-75-13, 14a]

Shlok 14b- 16a: Once, all the gods were asking the Grandparent, Brahma, as to who is powerful and who is less powerful among the blue-throated 
Shiva and Vishnu... but the Grandparent Brahma on inferring the intent of gods started to create adversity among those two, 
Shiva and Vishnu, for the Grandparent is the best adherer of truthfulness, as truth cannot be demonstrated on hearsay evidence... 
[1-75-14b, 15, 16a]

[Commentary] 







Legend: Brahma thought that it would better to enact a drama to cleanse the one-sided mentalities 
of these lesser gods. So, he started to write the script, and himself becoming the writer-director of that drama. That script 
is hereunder.







Brahma: Mahadeva, who is the destroyer of Tripura, or say triple-citadels?



Shiva: Why? It is me, of course...



Brahma: Why do you boast that way of yourself? It is the long-arrow of your longbow, isn't it?



Shiva: Yes of course...



Brahma: Then Vishnu was presiding deity of that long-bow... isn't t?



Shiva: Yes, it is he, but I shot it from my bow... basically, is this a confusion, or, are you playing any part of Narada...



Brahma: Not so, the other day Vishnu was telling that he alone did that master task...



Shiva: How can it be! In the triple of doer-deed-instrument, instrument cannot become the doer... has his language gone 
topsy-turvy, noun is becoming verb and verb is lost to adjective and...



Brahma: Ok, Ok... we do not care much for grammar as we care more for communication, grammar is paNini's headache... but 
what he said is that he alone did it... not you...



Shiva: Then why I am called... why that longbow is given to me... you should have got it done by Vishnu... 
why calling me... you have unnecessarily 
spoiled my dance program...



Brahma: Not that... I said what he said... let's not quarrel among ourselves...



Shiva: I not only quarrel but wage war, if it comes to my interests and my devotees' interest... how many times I have not 
done so...



Brahma: That is what Vishnu was telling... every time you give a boon to every demon, and involve yourself in enmeshment, 
and Vishnu has come to come and rescue... have he forgotten the episode of bhasmaasura... thus Vishnu is saying and asking...



Shiva: Now I don't tolerate... I will take him to task...



Exit Shiva - Enter Vishnu. Brahma reverses the above dialogue and says that to Vishnu



Vishnu: No, No, highly objectionable... I will take him to task... I will take him to task...



Exit All. War Started.

Shlok 16b- 17a: Owing to their animosity then occurred a fierce and hair-raising war among Shiva and Vishnu, as each aspired victory for 
himself... [1-75-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: By the 'hum' sound of Vishnu that ruinously overpowering longbow of Shiva is broken, and the triple-eyed God, Mahadeva, 
is frozen... [1-75-17b, 18a]

[Commentary] The bow is jR^imbhitam broken by the hum in dissent of Vishnu - Govindaraja. And Maheshvara Tiirtha says that the 
bow as well as Shiva are rendered jaDa motionless. There are many legends on this shiva-garvabhanga 'deflation 
of Shiva's pride' and some info about is given in endnote.

Shlok 18b- 19b: Then gods along with the assemblages of sages and celestial carana-s have come together and appealed to those two for appeasement 
in the matter of wielding authority, and then those two superior gods, Shiva and Vishnu, went into a state of amity... [1-75-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b- 20a: "On seeing the bow of Shiva rendered inert by the mettlesomeness of Vishnu, from then on the gods along with the assemblages 
of sages deemed Vishnu to be the paramount... [1-75-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b-21a: That celebrated Rudra on his part with indignation has handed over that longbow, which is already fitted with unloosened 
arrow, to the sagely king among Videha kings, namely Devaraata... [1-75-20b, 21a]

[Commentary] This longbow of Shiva is reported as given after the devastation of the ritual of Daksha Prajaapati, the father of Sati 
and the father-in-law of Shiva as said at 1-66-9: dakSayaj~navadhe puurvam dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan | This ritual 
of Daksha is a composite of many problems. Shiva neither as god nor as the son-in-law of Daksha is invited to that ritual, 
Shiva's consort Sati self-immolates herself in her father's ritual, Viira Bhadra and other deputies of Shiva depredate 
that ritual, and this shiva-keshavayuddha 'duelling of Shiva and Vishnu...' happens... all to show - a single 
person's disinterestedness ruins even a holy marriage. Here Daksha was uninterested to give his daughter Sati in marriage 
to Shiva.

Shlok 21b- 22a: Oh, Rama, this alone is that enemy-citadel conquering longbow of Vishnu, and Vishnu handed over this to Sage Riciika, the 
son of Bhrigu, as a trustworthy trust... [1-75-21b, 22a]

Shlok 22b-23a: That great-resplendent Sage Riciika on his part has handed over this divine bow to his son with unmatchable deeds of religious 
merit, who is my father Sage Jamadagni... [1-75-22b, 23a]

[Commentary] The word of Jamadagni means 'one who is born in Ritual-fire and having fire as his anima...' jaajamadya jajaane aham 
jajahii ha jajaayiSii | jamadagniH iti khyaatam tato maa viddhi shobhane || where the word jajaamanta is 'those 
who devour oblations repeatedly and at a single time in Vedic-rituals, namely gods; jamu - bhakshane so I am
jajiihi because I sprang up from Ritual-fire... and when the first syllable in ja jaamat is dropped it 
remained as jamat and when combined with fire jamat agni it shortened after dropping matup pratyaya 
to become jamadagni so oh, lady know me as one born and having Ritual-fire... or, Vedic-ritual itself...'

Shlok 23b- 24a: Adhering to a barbarous mentality Kaartaviirya Arjuna put my father to death, when the ascetically powerful father of 
mine has isolated himself from arsenal... [1-75-23b, 24a]

Shlok 24b: Oh, Rama, on hearing the unregenerate and highly perfidious murdering of my father, I rancorously extirpated Kshatriya-s 
as and when they are born, that too not for one time, but I did so for thirty-seven times going around the earth... and 
on getting the entire earth under my control I performed Vedic-ritual, and at the end of that Vedic-ritual, I gave all that 
earth to sage Kashyapa, a sage with divine soul and with pious observances, as a ritualistic-generosity... and I am at present 
on Mt. Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me... [1-75-24b, c, 25, 26a]

Shlok 26b- 27: On hearing about the breakage of Shiva's longbow, then I promptly came here. Thereby, oh, Rama, wield this supernatural 
and superlative longbow of Vishnu, which is passed on to me from my forefathers and my father. Keep your fealty to Kshatriya-hood 
in view, and wield this as you have wielded Shiva's longbow... [1-75-26b, 27]

Shlok 27: Take an aim with an arrow that conquers enemy's citadels fixing it on this supramundane longbow... and oh, Kakutstha, should 
you be capable of it, thereafter I will give you a duel... [1-75-27]

[Commentary] This is a long drawn bloody quarrel between the two sects of vaiSNavism Vishnu faith and
shaivism Shiva faith, over centuries. Here it is doubtlessly expressed in the epic that Vishnu 
is superior to Shiva. anena shivaat viShNoH utkarShaH 
pratipaaditaH - ayam eva arthaH | dk 'by this Vishnu is proposed to be superior to Shiva...' but it does 
not mean 'every time or everlastingly...' Insofar as the incarnations are concerned, it is Vishnu, but not Shiva. In philosophy, 
both are one and in theology, they are separate. sR^iShTi-sthiti-antakaaraNaat 
brahma-vishNu-shivaatmikaam | sa sanj~naam yaati bhagavaan eka eva janaardanaH || vishNu-puraaNa api cet samaram praapya 
bhaviShyasi maam adhikaH | bhaarata - droNa-parva ekam eva advitiiyam brahma - sat eva saumaya idam agram assiit - sarvam 
khalvidam brahma - brahmaa vaa idam agre asiit - hiraNyagarbhasamavartataagre - antarbahiH ca tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayaNa 
sthitaH - eka eva rudro na dvitiiyaaya tasthe - ekam sad vipraa bahudhaa vadanti ekam santam bahudhaa kalpayanti - abheda 
shruti where the last one is 'when there is only one Absolute wise men and poets create many of his forms...' 
to explain in ordinary parlance, that too through Puraana-s. This is because of the complexity of Vedas. In fact, Vedas 
do not tell anything straightaway 'this god, that is god...' but asks us, rather intuits us, to infer ourselves about the 
nature of god, according to our own IQ. And to be precise, Vedic gods are different from Puranic gods and Veda holds on 
to one Brahman, or The Absolute. The Rain-god, Fire-god, Indra et al are the instrumental gods in knowing that Absolute. 
The content of Vedas is just like the complexity of complex video game of present day. The more you play you either get 
yourself addicted to it, or shun it, or get demented by it.

[Commentary] Vedas go on saying pure truths in plain terms like: sham naH suuryorucakShu- 
udaitu sham nah catasraH pradiipto bhavantu | sham naH dhruvayo bhavantu naH sindhavaH shamu san santi aapaH || R^igveda 
7-35-8 - 'Bless that the sun, with extensive radiance, Rises for peace. May the four quarters of horizon, Be auspicious 
for peace and harmony...' What is so great about the sun or his radiance? If we persist in asking why this is said like 
that, then a dozen other quotes will be brought in to explain the idea behind it. Again another hymn:
sahasrashiirShaa puruShaH 
sahasraakShaH sahasrapaat | R^igved 10-90-1 - 'He has thousands of heads, He has thousands of eyes...' 
It would be ridiculous to think of a god with thousands of heads and thousands of eyes, but if it is explained 'He has thousands 
of heads, to think about mankind, and he has thousands of eyes to watch over the good and bad deeds of mankind... it may 
be meaningful. Max Muller has this to say about the study of Vedas:

[Commentary] Of course, this learning of Vedas by heart is carried on under a strict discipline; it is, in fact, considered as a sacred 
duty. A native friend of mine... tells me that a boy, who is to be brought up as a student of Rig Veda, has to spend about 
eight years in the house of his teacher. He has to learn ten books: first, the hymns of Rig ved; then a prose treatise on 
sacrifices, called the braahmaNa; then the so-called Forest book or aranyaka; 
then the rules of domestic ceremonies; and lastly, six treatises on pronunciation, grammar, etymology, metre, astronomy, 
and ceremonial...' India can it what teach us, by Max Muller - a recent republication of Penguin.

[Commentary] All the above is for no practical utility in these days, except for an enquiry into that 'Brahman.' So also there is a probability 
for phonetic problem uccaraNadoSa in Vedas which causes pratyavaaya 
a boomeranging bad effect. If we wish to chant its hymn 'oh, Indra, slay my enemies...' and if a diphthong or a diagraph 
is mispronounced it becomes 'Oh, Indra, kill me, instead of my enemies...' and it is said to happen that way
yad bhaavam tad bhavati... Unless they are practised for a life time, they are un-understandable, 
hence they are set aside and Puraana-s are brought in their place. Further, the effect of Vedas is said to be declining 
according to yugadharma era theory... What that was available in satya- 
yuga a period where the conflict was only between god and man, for e.g., the legend of Harishcandra and his truth 
speaking, which stands tested by almost all gods, but that truthfulness is lessened in treta-yuga 
Ramayana's period, where the conflict was between man and demons, which dharma is further lessened in
dvaapara-yuga period of Maha Bharata, where the conflict is among one's own brothers, and that 
much dharma of that period is almost extinct in kali-yuga which is obvious, from the known 
history of India, where the conflicts are going on between man and man - husband and wife, father and son, neighbour and 
neighbour, and so on.
This is on par with the four-legged dharma, The Holy Bull, nandi 
loosing its legs one after the other and now you will see that Bull in any sculpture with half raised right foreleg, where 
other three went under its belly.

So Puraana-s are evolved to throw some light on what Vedas have to say, of course with some religious overtones. Elsewhere 
we have detailed about Puraana-s of them Shiva and Vishnu Puraana-s are though prominent, but their adherers quarrel tooth 
and nail about the superiority of Shiva or Vishnu. In Vishnu Puraana many instances of coalescence of Vishnu with Shiva 
are narrated tvat vaakyagauravaat etat 
mayaa cakram nivartitam | tvayaa yat abhayam dattam tat datttam akhilam mayaa - Krishna says to Shiva 
at the time of eliminating a demon called Baana Asura, 'As you say I have taken back my disc, and if you give a boon I deem 
all that is given by me...' So many instances can be quoted like this. But here Parashu Rama has no intention to kill Dasharatha 
Rama, as said in Padma Puraana: rarakSha bhagavaan - bhaargava 
raamaH - ekam ikShvaakostu mahaakulam | maataamahasya anvayatvaat reNukaavacanaat tathaa | 'that god 
Bhaargava Rama safeguarded one great dynasty of Ikshvaku-s, for they are related to his grandmother, besides at the request 
of Renuka Devi, his mother...' So, god Bhaargava Rama is a nepotist and saved Dasharatha Rama. Not so, Bhaargava Rama is 
neither a nepotist nor a god to be worshipped. He is not worshipped because his incarnation is not a full incarnation of 
Vishnu as Dasharatha Rama. Only the wrathful impetuosity of Vishnu is incarnated like Bhaargava Rama to perform butchery 
and even infanticide. bhaargavo ati dR^iptaH prasiddhaH 
tadaaniim ca krodhaandha iti svakShatriyavadhaat upratam shastrasannyaasam ca parityajya capala iti viditaH 
'Bhaargava Rama is a highly impudent personality and blinded by his wrath, thus to eliminate his own Kshatriya-s [namely 
his own relatives, Dasharatha and his sons; again the caste system is peeping in, isn't it!] On overstepping his pledge 
of renunciation of weaponry, he came... hence his actions are faltering...' appayaa diikshita, 
a shaivaite. He came here to perform certain unsaid action, which we will see in next episode.

SARGA 76
------------------------------

[Text] Rama takes aim with Vishnu's longbow and asks Parashu Rama to choose the target to release the arrow, as arrow 
			of that bow cannot go astray. Parashu Rama opts for elimination of his ascetic merit and heavenly realms thereby. 
			Rama releases the bow annihilating that merit and after that, Parashu Rama retreats into oblivion.

Shlok 1: On hearing that sentence of Rama of Jamadagni, then Rama of Dasharatha said this to him in a courtly owing to the presence 
of his father Dasharatha. [1-76-1]

Shlok 2: Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness towards your father, 
I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness from your paternal debt, but... [1-76-2]

Shlok 3: "Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble 
one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness..." So said Rama to 
Bhaargava. [1-76-3]

[Commentary] Up to here both these Rama-s are in close quarters with other few present there. After this dialogue, they have moved a 
little away from the throng and facing each other as true combatants. A swordsman or an archer needs an arm-length, or sword-length 
or bow-length, at the least, to swagger his weapon. This place is to be assumed as an isolated place and no one is seeing 
or listening. This scene has an analogy in Maha Bharata when Krishna teaches Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. There, it is said, 
that Krishna froze the time to teach all the eighteen chapters, and none among two sides of warring factions are aware of 
Krishna, his teachings, or of Arjuna, excepting Sanjaya, who is placed at a distant place and has seen all with his wisdom-eye. 
Here we have to borrow that wisdom-eye of Sanjaya and see at these two Rama-s and their actions. When their episode is over 
the mist cast around them, rather on our eyes, will be cleared, when Rama returns to his father. This is said in later verses. 
Further more, all the people available there are rendered unconscious at the arrival of Bhaargava Rama, and a few like Dasharatha, 
Vashishta, Rama's brothers are with senses. So, even if they hear and see this scene, those listeners or seers do no harm 
in revealing Rama's godhood to world, or in particular to Ravana.

Shlok 4: Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that estimable weapon, 
namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow that is already fitted on it... 
[1-76-4]

[Commentary] and, along the same lines Rama also said to have extricated the essential nature of Bhaargava...' The above said 'distancing' 
of these two Rama-s has another purpose. Rama has certain innate nature of making his observers enchanted by his very personality. 
Even Ravana looks at him adoringly in the war scene. This apart, his hand has certain ability to extricate the innate nature 
of others, should he lay his hand on them. We rarely see him touching or patting others, except for Seetha, Lakshmana, Hanuma, 
and say a squirrel etc. So, it is believed that, Rama has now expropriated the essential nature of Vishnu from Bhaargava 
Rama, while snatching the bow from his hands. For this Padma Puraana says:iti uktvaa devii vaiShNavyaa shaktyaa tad 
gataayaa saha | jagraaha vaiShNavam caapam vinayena ca liilayaa || 'oh, Devi Parvati, saying so Rama took away the 
Vishnu's anima from Bhaargava Rama, along with bow of Vishnu, sportily and obediently, too...' Thus, Rama of Dasharatha 
bade goodbye to his earlier incarnation, Parashu Rama, as two swords cannot be in one sheath.

Shlok 5: On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim with it, but being 
indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of Jamagadni. [1-76-5]

Shlok 6: Oh Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship with Vishvamitra, 
and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow that exterminates your life... [1-76-6]

[Commentary] Bhaargava-s are Brahman-s and a Brahman cannot be killed braahmaNo na hantavyaH then how Rama is prepared to eliminate 
a Brahman, subjecting himself to the sin called 'Brahman killing...' brahmahatyaa paataka... There is no sin in 
eliminating a Brahman who is weaponed and warring. tathaa ca bhaarate raajadharme kR^iShNam prati bhiiShmaH - pitruun 
pitaamahaan pitryam guruun sambandhibaandhavaan | mithyaapravR^ittaan yaH sa~Nkhye nihanyaa dharma eva saH || Maha 
Bharata, shannti parva. 'It is no sin to eliminated fathers, grandfathers, teachers, and the like [even if they are Brahman-s,] 
for they are under an illusion, called war...' So said Bhiishma to Krishna and thereby Panadava-s have eliminated Drona, 
Kripa, Ashvatthaama and suchlike weaponed Brahman-s in war, but not in peace. There are many more such sayings of Bhiishma. 
Here Parashu Rama said that he will give a duel to Rama, hence he is no more a Brahman when he raises a weapon. And he is 
a blood relation of Vishvamitra, and that corner of mercy is not allowing Rama to release the arrow on Parashu Rama.

Shlok 7: Oh Bhaargava Rama, either this motility of yours at the speed of your mind, or even those unparalleled realms of heavens 
which you have earned by the power of your ascesis, I will eliminate whichever you wish... [1-76-7]

Shlok 8: "This Vishnu's divine arrow is the conqueror of opponents' citadels, and a vanquisher of their vigour and vainglory, and 
it will not fall through wastefully... isn't it!" So said archer Rama to axeman Rama. [1-76-8]

[Commentary] The debate on the superiority of Vishnu or Shiva may have its own mythological import, but as far as Ramayana is considered, 
the eulogy for Vishnu's longbow is intended to suggest the all-powerful capacity of Vishnu in eliminating demons and to 
lead the epic to its own goal. Dharmaakuutam has to say this: prakR^ite - adhikam menire vishNum - iti raamaayaNavacanam 
tu agre kartavyasakalaraakShasavadhahetubhuutavaiShNavadhanuShaH praashastapratipaadanaparam j~neyam | Hence 
the mythological quarrels have no place in Ramayana.

Shlok 9: Gods together with the assemblages of sages have come keeping the Grandparent Brahma at their fore, likewise the gandharva-s, 
apsara-s, siddha-s, caarana-s, kinnaraa-s, yaksha-s, sprites and reptilian beings have also come to see Rama who is now 
wielding the extraordinary longbow of Vishnu, and extremely amazing event that is going to ensue. [1-76-9, 10]

[Commentary] The 'amazing event' is not the handing over or taking over of longbow, but it is the transference of the essential nature 
of Bhaargava Rama to Dasharatha Rama. Nrisimha Puraana has this: tataH parashuraamasya dehaat nirgatasya vaiShNavam 
| pashyataam sarvadevaanaam tejo raamam upaavishat ||

Shlok 11: Then, when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being rendered 
as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama of Dasharatha. [1-76-11]

[Commentary] Vividly: When the aura of Vishnu available in Bhaargava Rama has entered Dasharatha Rama through that inscrutable longbow 
of Vishnu, Dasharatha Rama's aura dazzled like that of Vishnu, and that dazzlement of Vishnu's aura threw the world in a 
daze, and then that aura-less, thus vigourless Bhaargava Rama has nothing to do except to stare at Vishnu-like Rama, with 
upraised eyes.

Shlok 12: Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama of Dasharatha, and 
he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly. [1-76-12]

Shlok 13: Once, when I donated entire earth to Sage Kashyapa, Kashyapa told me 'uninhabitable is my domain, viz., this earth for 
you...' thus... [1-76-13]

[Commentary] A donor cannot enjoy a gift anymore, once donated to the donee. And if the donor still clings around that donation, it does 
not come under the true definition of 'donation.' Hence, Parashu Rama is asked to depart from this world. Hence he has gone 
to the ethereal mountain called Mt. Mahendra.

Shlok 14: Such as I was, in my observance of my mentor Kashyapa's order I do not spend nights on this earth from then afterwards, 
oh, Kakutstha Rama, as I made over this earth for Kashyapa, indeed... [1-76-14]

Shlok 15: Thereby oh, valiant one, it will be inapt of you to impair this motility of mine, oh, Raghava, I will depart with the speed 
of cerebration to Mt. Mahendra, a par excellent mountain... [1-76-15]

Shlok 16: But I triumphed over matchless realms of heavens with my ascesis, oh, Rama, you may hash them up with that irreversible 
arrow... let there be no time-lag... [1-76-16]

Shlok 17: I have realized your touch of nature as that of the Immutable Supreme Being, God of Gods, the Exterminator of the demon 
Madhu, namely Vishnu, by the touch of your handling that bow... oh, enemy-inflamer, blessedness alone betides you... [1-76-17]

Shlok 18: All of these gods who have come collectively are beholding you and your next move, for you are an unequalled one in your 
achievements and to whom there is no counter-dueller in conflicts... [1-76-18]

[Commentary] Parashu Rama is hastening up Dasharatha Rama to finish business quickly, otherwise the nature of Rama and his incarnation 
will publicized, not by these two Rama-s, but the game watching gods. If these spectators stay for a long time in sky, some 
airborne demon will let the cat out of the bag.

Shlok 19: Oh, Kakutstha Rama, you are the lord of the triad of worlds, such as you are, you faced me down, and it is malapropos to 
say that this is a disgrace to me... [1-76-19]

Shlok 20: "It will be apt of you to unloose that unsurpassed arrow, oh, Rama, as you have ethical commitment to wipe out demons as 
I wiped out menacing kings, and should you unloosen that arrow now I wish to depart to the ethereal mountain Mt. Mahendra, 
a point of no return for me..." So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-76-20]

Shlok 21: While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off that nonpareil arrow 
from that longbow of Vishnu. [1-76-21]

Shlok 22: On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to 
Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain. [1-76-22]

[Commentary] Rather, ready to depart... as he is given some more role-play in next verses.

Shlok 23: Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, and the gods with 
the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised. [1-76-23]

[Commentary] Please refer the endnote about this longbow and how it is passed on to Janaka's dynasty.

Shlok 24: Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to Rama of Dasharatha, 
went on his own way into oblivion. [1-76-24]

[Commentary] The bestowal of Shiva's bow to the dynasty of Janaka is said variously at various places. In the hermitage 
Vishvamitra it is said that the bow is given in Vedic-ritual taddhi puurvam narashreSTha 
dattam sadasi daivataiH | 1-31-8 In the previous chapter it is said that the bow is given in 
the hand of Devaraata devaraatasya raajaRSeH dadau haste sasaayakam | 1-75-20 
And earlier it is said to be given in Dasksha's ritual dakSayaj~navadhe puurvam 
dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan | 1-66-9 Seetha says about this to ascetic Lady Anasuya that Rain-god 
gave this to Janaka's dynasty mahaayaj~ne tadaa tasya varuNena mahaatmanaa | dattam 
dhanurvaram priityaa tuuNii caakSayyasaayakau | Ayodhya II-118. These statements, though not 
self-contradictory, and though they create a little confusion, they all are correct. When Daksha's Vedic-ritual 
is devastated, Shiva wanted to throw back the useless bow, that was worsted by Vishnu's bow, on the 
face of gods. But gods fearing for the ire of Shiva requested Shiva to give that bow to Devaraata, on 
their behalf. Shiva gave it to Devaraata as a trust, through Rain-god Varuna, but Shiva did no bequeath 
it. Later Janaka on appeasing gods in Vedic-ritual asked them to leave the bow once for all in Janaka 
Dynasty. Gods have agreed to it. And Rama broke it.

[Commentary] Now Dasharatha Rama gives back the other bow of Vishnu brought by Parashu Rama to the same Rain-god 
Varuna, who is present there at both Rama-s, in the thin air, when the environ is enshrouded by certain 
darkness, and when Rama is last seen with that upraised longbow at 1-76-23, and just before darkness 
is dissipated, Rama gives that bow to Rain-god, according to the first verse in next chapter.

[Commentary] Well known is Krishna's showing his Cosmic Form vishvaruupa to Arjuna, 
while teaching Bhagavad Gita in Maha Bharata. But that Bharata records Rama's display of His Cosmic 
form to Parashu Rama, only at this juncture. In Ch. 89 of anushaashanika parva 
of Maha Bharata it is said in detail as: pashya maam svena ruupeNa cakShuH te vitaraamyaham | tato 
raamashariire vai raama pashyati bhaargavaH |aadityaan pavamaanaan rudraan saadhyaan ca samarudgaNaana 
| pitaro hutaashanaH caiva nakShatraaNi grahaaH tathaa | and a long account follows on this. But 
this has not been amplified or explained in other texts, due to unknown reasons. However, it is not 
part of Valmiki Ramayana.



SARGA 77
------------------------------

[Text] The wedding party arrives at Ayodhya on the exit of Parashu Rama. Yudhaajit, the maternal uncle of Bharata, 
			who came before marriages, now takes Bharata and Shatrughna to his kingdom. Rama and Lakshmana from then on 
			are engaged in the welfare works of their subjects, at the behest of their father. Rama and Seetha will then 
			enter the threshold of their blissful married life.

Shlok 1: On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and he gave away that 
longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god. [1-77-1]

[Commentary] On this longbow and its giving to god of Rain, some discussion is incorporated in the earlier chapter.

Shlok 2: On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu's lineage, placatingly 
addressed his agitated father Dasharatha. [1-77-2]

Shlok 3: "Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, 
to move on towards Ayodhya..." So said Rama to his father. [1-77-3]

Shlok 4- 5: On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the forehead of Raghava, 
and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is further gladdened in deeming 
that he and his sons took a rebirth. [1-77-4, 5]

Shlok 6- 7- 8a: Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful city Ayodhya, whose 
royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and bannerettes up above 
them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with urbanites welcomers who 
are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, 
flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced 
at their king's re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. [1-77-7, 8a]

Shlok 8b- 9: When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king Dasharatha followed 
by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the lofty and lordly Himalayan 
palazzo. [1-77-8b, 9]

[Commentary] 'King entered the house...' is not just an entrance of a character into a scene, but it entails a lot of ceremony called
gR^ihapravesha 'entering into householder-hood, the second stage of life gaarhapatya-dharma out of the 
four stages of living, 1] celibate scholar, 2] householder, 3] repairing to forest or sageship, 4] final release, moksha.
paaNigrahaNaanantaram kriyamaaNo gR^ihapraveshaH - dk where ceremonies go on for hours together.

Shlok 10- 11a: In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and when his long 
cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and other wives are 
overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides. [1-77-10]

[Commentary] Again this 'receiving bride' is an elaborate variety of fun and games of womenfolk will take place, at which place there 
is almost no entry to men. For example, name telling. An Indian bride, or the later time wife is supposed to not to call 
her husband by his name. It is a sacred taboo, and her addressing shall be in genderless, person-less, and numberless hooting, 
cooing or calling like e jii - o jii - emanDii - ennango - shuniye so on. To cite one such ceremony it is 'naming 
game.' Here the bride is compelled to tell the name of her husband, and she will be hesitating to do so, because of her 
newness to this house or to her husband. After some teasing attempts, she mutters her husband's name, and then only she 
will be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and dampening is that fun, in these days of 
readymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly functions, they do all those womanish things... 
because, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained 
four brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness. It may be observed that Kaikeyi is the lone queen with 'beauty' 
as her attribute, and the problem with her is seeded here alone, saying that enchantment of Dasharatha towards her outweighs 
his affection to Rama, later.

Shlok 11b-12a: Then the womenfolk of the king welcomed the highly propitious Seetha and the highly fortunate Urmila too, along with both 
the daughters of Kushadhvaja, namely Maandavi and Shrutakiirti, with pageantry and festivity. [1-77-11b, 12a]

Shlok 12b-13a: All of the brides and bridegrooms clad in silks promptly worshipped the gods in sanctums to the benedictory chanting of 
Vedic hymns and Ritual-fires, thus they shone forth like the tongues of Holy Fires of Vedic Altars. [1-77-12b, 13a]

[Commentary] These young couples by themselves are radiant, and they are now clad in radiant silks that glitter wavily like the tongues 
of fire, and the Ritual-fire s are already there flaring wavily, to the weave-like chanting of Vedic benedictions. With 
all these waving, flaring, glaring the couples too appeared as the humanly Ritual-fires before the wood burnt Vedic Ritual-fires.

Shlok 13b- 14a: Then all the princesses paid respects to all of the respectable ones, and they luxuriated in sequestered palace-chambers 
along with their husbands. [1-77-13b, 14a]

[Commentary] This 'paying respects to respectable elders' is but one line. In reality, the torsos of those that pay respects will be 
put to test, because they have to 'pay' by bending and touching the feet of elders, each time to each, paadaabhivandana, 
pai lagoo . And if the girls are from jeans or pants culture, [because days have gone,] they will be fresh and new 
to bridal sari, which itself will be a weight to carry. And many times we see the young brides falling on the blessing couple 
because her bridal sari gets entangled in the toes of the bride, and she is not yet ready to manage it. So goes on this 
parade until their backs are broken.

Shlok 14b- 15a: And those best men among men, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, who are by now accomplished persons in weaponry and 
whose marriages have also come to pass, occupied themselves in the welfare of kingdom while assisting their father and moving 
around with good hearted people. [1-77-14b, 15a]

Shlok 15b- 16a: Then after sometime that king Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, spoke to his and Kaikeyi's son, Bharata. [1-77-15b, 16a]

Shlok 16b- 17a: "This is your maternal uncle and the son of king of Kekaya, and this valiant Yudhaajit came here to take you to Kekaya province, 
and he is staying behind because of your marriage..." thus Dasharatha bade farewell to Bharata suggesting that Bharata may 
now go with Yudhaajit. [1-77-16b, 17a]

Shlok 17b- 18a: On hearing the opinion of Dasharatha, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, then readied himself to travel along with Shatrughna 
to Kekaya province. [1-77-17b, 18a]

Shlok 18b- 19a: That valiant and best one among men Bharata on asking leave from his father, from Rama, an uncomplicatedly dextrous one 
in undertaking deeds, and even from his mothers, Kaikeyi, Sumitra, and Kausalya, travelled on along with Shatrughna. [1-77-18b, 
19a]

Shlok 19b-20a: Yudhaajit on clinching not only Bharata, but Shatrughna also, that valiant one is highly gladdened and entered his own city, 
indeed to the high rejoice of his father, King of Kekaya. [1-77-19b, 20a]

Shlok 20b- 21a: After the departure of Bharata, then the masterly proficient Rama along with Lakshmana started to square with the plans 
and programs of his godly father for an ideal-sovereignty. [1-77-20b, 21a]

Shlok 21b- 22-23a: Rama keeping his father's directives in view undertook welfare activities for the people that are agreeable and even advantageous 
to them, and in the entirety of those activities, and he undertook activities to humour motherly affection with his mothers, 
and educational activities with educators, and in a highly self-disciplined manner he used to review them carefully from 
time to time. [1-77-22b, 22, 23a]

Shlok 23b- 24-25a: That way Dasharatha is pleased with the deportment and comportment of Rama, likewise the Brahman-s and urbanites, and even 
all of the indwellers in the entire kingdom are pleased, and he who has high distinction, his truthfulness alone is his 
vantage point, and whose hallmarks are of higher degree, that Rama has manifested himself to those subjects in the kingdom, 
and even to all of the living beings in the world, as the Self-Created Brahma. [1-77-23b, 24, 25a]

Shlok 25b-26a: Also, that hearty Rama who permeated into the heart of Seetha is ensconced in Seetha's heart alone, and he disported for 
many seasons along with Seetha. [1-77-25b, 26a]

[Commentary] The other mms use raamaH tu instead of raamaH ca where this tu says a difference. Then, 'Rama 
is busy in welfare and other works of state, tu 'but' he is also impassioned for Seetha. And he is manasvii 
'hearty one' warm, friendly, spirited etc., are his dispositions for kingdom, people, governmental works tu 'but' 
he is that 'hearty' for Seetha... Hence tad gataH - tasyaam gataH 'he pervaded her psyche, hence casketed in her 
heart... In the other mms it will be tasyaaH hR^idi nityam samarpitaH 'heart of Seetha is 'always' dedicated to 
Rama... and that word nityam 'always, eternal, everlasting...' couple. So, they may be a couple from time immemorial
tu 'but' they are as good as a fresh and fervent young couple... bahuun R^ituun 'for many, many seasons 
to come...' he is disporting with Seetha. Why tell seasons when there is calculated calendar with years, decades, and centuries... 
Not so... their disporting is according to seasons, with seasonal environ, with a seasonable togetherness... vijahaara 
is grammatically a parasmaipadi then the fruition goes to the subject, and subject of the verse is Rama, so he 
alone is the enjoyer and insatiate is his enjoyment with Seetha, even during and after bahuun R^ituun many, and 
many seasons. niravadhikaparasparabaddhaanuraagaabhivR^iddhi ' an endless, mutual, conjugal, impassion and 
its enrichment - the self-content bliss of monogamy.

Shlok 26b- 27a: Seetha has become the beloved of Rama as she is wedded with the assent of his father Dasharatha, further Rama's love for 
Seetha burgeoned by virtue of Seetha's own virtues and loveliness. [1-77-26b, 27a]

[Commentary] Here the good old saying atiruupavatii siitaa - atimuurkhaH ca raavaNaH 'Seetha is the greatest beauty, Ravana 
is the highest pigheaded demon...' may be remembered. He loved her for his father's voice / Had given her and approved the 
choice: / He loved her for each charm she wore / And her sweet virtues more and more. - Griffith.

Shlok 27b- 28a: Even Rama as her husband made his mark in Seetha's heart twice as good, and they both used to clearly converse about their 
thoughts in their heart of hearts, just by their hearts. [1-77-27b, 28a]

Shlok 28b: In her mien Seetha is identical with goddesses, and she is like personified Goddess Lakshmi, thus she is the reshaped Divine 
Prosperity, and as she hails from Holy Mithila she shall be held Holy, and since she is the daughter of Janaka, a loftiest 
sagacious and invincible king, she is sagely and stately, besides being shapely, and she with all these heaps of natural 
traits and characteristics, Seetha is rejoicing the heart of Rama. [1-77-28b, c]

Shlok 29: When passionately conjugated with such a princess from the irreproachable king Janaka, Rama, the son of sagely king Dasharatha, 
has enthusiastically shone forth like the God of Gods and the Efficient Cause, namely Vishnu, when He is together with Goddess 
Lakshmi. [1-77-29]

[Commentary] The 'son of king' suggests that Rama as a prospective king has no paucity for any items of enjoyment. The best 'princess' 
suggests that Seetha is no less than him, but now her prosperity edges on that of Rama, because she has Rama as her husband. 
And how will be their mutual affection and love? Many more pages can be written on it, but insufficiently, and perhaps inefficiently. 
This stanza from a romantic work maalatii maadhaviiyam will say how such a love would be:
liinena prati bimbite iva 
likhite utkiirNaruupeva ca | pratyupteva ca vajralepaghaTite ivaantarnikhaateva ca | saa naH cetasi kiilitena vishikhaiH 
ceto bhuvaH pancabhiH | cintaasantatitantujaalena nibiDasyuuteva lagnaa priyaa || 'my darling is 
immersed in my heart as sugar merges in milk, as the Red oleander reflects in a prism, as a portrait painted on canvas, 
as a picture carved on a stone tablet, as a gem studded in a ring, as bedaubed skin-cream, and as though the five darts 
of Love-god are nailed fixedly, [which darts usually will be in a touch-and-go fashion,] and as though stringed with thought-strings 
of my heartstrings, that are the halters with fastness...'
